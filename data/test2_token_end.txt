scarlett,o'hara,was,not,beautiful,but,men,seldom,realized,it,when,caught,by,her,charm,as,the,tarleton,twins,were,<END>
in,her,face,were,too,sharply,blended,the,delicate,features,of,her,mother,a,coast,aristocrat,of,french,descent,and,the,heavy,ones,of,her,florid,irish,father,<END>
but,it,was,an,arresting,face,pointed,of,chin,square,of,jaw,<END>
her,eyes,were,pale,green,without,a,touch,of,hazel,starred,with,bristly,black,lashes,and,slightly,tilted,at,the,ends,<END>
above,them,her,thick,black,brows,slanted,upward,cutting,a,startling,oblique,line,in,her,magnolia-white,skin,that,skin,so,prized,by,southern,women,and,so,carefully,guarded,with,bonnets,veils,and,mittens,against,hot,georgia,suns,<END>
seated,with,stuart,and,brent,tarleton,in,the,cool,shade,of,the,porch,of,tara,her,father's,plantation,that,bright,april,afternoon,of,1861,she,made,a,pretty,picture,<END>
her,new,green,flowered-muslin,dress,spread,its,twelve,yards,of,billowing,material,over,her,hoops,and,exactly,matched,the,flat-heeled,green,morocco,slippers,her,father,had,recently,brought,her,from,atlanta,<END>
the,dress,set,off,to,perfection,the,seventeen-inch,waist,the,smallest,in,three,counties,and,the,tightly,fitting,basque,showed,breasts,well,matured,for,her,sixteen,years,<END>
but,for,all,the,modesty,of,her,spreading,skirts,the,demureness,of,hair,netted,smoothly,into,a,chignon,and,the,quietness,of,small,white,hands,folded,in,her,lap,her,true,self,was,poorly,concealed,<END>
the,green,eyes,in,the,carefully,sweet,face,were,turbulent,willful,lusty,with,life,distinctly,at,variance,with,her,decorous,demeanor,<END>
her,manners,had,been,imposed,upon,her,by,her,mother's,gentle,admonitions,and,the,sterner,discipline,of,her,mammy,her,eyes,were,her,own,<END>
on,either,side,of,her,the,twins,lounged,easily,in,their,chairs,squinting,at,the,sunlight,through,tall,mint-garnished,glasses,as,they,laughed,and,talked,their,long,legs,booted,to,the,knee,and,thick,with,saddle,muscles,crossed,negligently,<END>
nineteen,years,old,six,feet,two,inches,tall,long,of,bone,and,hard,of,muscle,with,sunburned,faces,and,deep,auburn,hair,their,eyes,merry,and,arrogant,their,bodies,clothed,in,identical,blue,coats,and,mustard-colored,breeches,they,were,as,much,alike,as,two,bolls,of,cotton,<END>
outside,the,late,afternoon,sun,slanted,down,in,the,yard,throwing,into,gleaming,brightness,the,dogwood,trees,that,were,solid,masses,of,white,blossoms,against,the,background,of,new,green,<END>
the,twins',horses,were,hitched,in,the,driveway,big,animals,red,as,their,masters',hair,and,around,the,horses',legs,quarreled,the,pack,of,lean,nervous,possum,hounds,that,accompanied,stuart,and,brent,wherever,they,went,<END>
a,little,aloof,as,became,an,aristocrat,lay,a,black-spotted,carriage,dog,muzzle,on,paws,patiently,waiting,for,the,boys,to,go,home,to,supper,<END>
between,the,hounds,and,the,horses,and,the,twins,there,was,a,kinship,deeper,than,that,of,their,constant,companionship,<END>
they,were,all,healthy,thoughtless,young,animals,sleek,graceful,high-spirited,the,boys,as,mettlesome,as,the,horses,they,rode,mettlesome,and,dangerous,but,withal,sweet-tempered,to,those,who,knew,how,to,handle,them,<END>
although,born,to,the,ease,of,plantation,life,waited,on,hand,and,foot,since,infancy,the,faces,of,the,three,on,the,porch,were,neither,slack,nor,soft,<END>
they,had,the,vigor,and,alertness,of,country,people,who,have,spent,all,their,lives,in,the,open,and,troubled,their,heads,very,little,with,dull,things,in,books,<END>
life,in,the,north,georgia,county,of,clayton,was,still,new,and,according,to,the,standards,of,augusta,savannah,and,charleston,a,little,crude,<END>
the,more,sedate,and,older,sections,of,the,south,looked,down,their,noses,at,the,up-country,georgians,but,here,in,north,georgia,a,lack,of,the,niceties,of,classical,education,carried,no,shame,provided,a,man,was,smart,in,the,things,that,mattered,<END>
and,raising,good,cotton,riding,well,shooting,straight,dancing,lightly,squiring,the,ladies,with,elegance,and,carrying,one's,liquor,like,a,gentleman,were,the,things,that,mattered,<END>
in,these,accomplishments,the,twins,excelled,and,they,were,equally,outstanding,in,their,notorious,inability,to,learn,anything,contained,between,the,covers,of,books,<END>
their,family,had,more,money,more,horses,more,slaves,than,any,one,else,in,the,county,but,the,boys,had,less,grammar,than,most,of,their,poor,cracker,neighbors,<END>
it,was,for,this,precise,reason,that,stuart,and,brent,were,idling,on,the,porch,of,tara,this,april,afternoon,<END>
they,had,just,been,expelled,from,the,university,of,georgia,the,fourth,university,that,had,thrown,them,out,in,two,years,and,their,older,brothers,tom,and,boyd,had,come,home,with,them,because,they,refused,to,remain,at,an,institution,where,the,twins,were,not,welcome,<END>
stuart,and,brent,considered,their,latest,expulsion,a,fine,joke,and,scarlett,who,had,not,willingly,opened,a,book,since,leaving,the,fayetteville,female,academy,the,year,before,thought,it,just,as,amusing,as,they,did,<END>
i,know,you,two,don't,care,about,being,expelled,or,tom,either,she,said,<END>
but,what,about,boyd,<END>
he's,kind,of,set,on,getting,an,education,and,you,two,have,pulled,him,out,of,the,university,of,virginia,and,alabama,and,south,carolina,and,now,georgia,<END>
he'll,never,get,finished,at,this,rate,<END>
oh,he,can,read,law,in,judge,parmalee's,office,over,in,fayetteville,answered,brent,carelessly,<END>
besides,it,don't,matter,much,<END>
we'd,have,had,to,come,home,before,the,term,was,out,anyway,<END>
why,<END>
the,war,goose,<END>
the,war's,going,to,start,any,day,and,you,don't,suppose,any,of,us,would,stay,in,college,with,a,war,going,on,do,you,<END>
you,know,there,isn't,going,to,be,any,war,said,scarlett,bored,<END>
it's,all,just,talk,<END>
why,ashley,wilkes,and,his,father,told,pa,just,last,week,that,our,commissioners,in,washington,would,come,to,to,an,amicable,agreement,with,mr,lincoln,about,the,confederacy,<END>
and,anyway,the,yankees,are,too,scared,of,us,to,fight,<END>
there,won't,be,any,war,and,i'm,tired,of,hearing,about,it,<END>
not,going,to,be,any,war,<END>
cried,the,twins,indignantly,as,though,they,had,been,defrauded,<END>
why,honey,of,course,there's,going,to,be,a,war,said,stuart,<END>
the,yankees,may,be,scared,of,us,but,after,the,way,general,beauregard,shelled,them,out,of,fort,sumter,day,before,yesterday,they'll,have,to,fight,or,stand,branded,as,cowards,before,the,whole,world,<END>
why,the,confederacy,<END>
scarlett,made,a,mouth,of,bored,impatience,<END>
if,you,say,'war',just,once,more,i'll,go,in,the,house,and,shut,the,door,<END>
i've,never,gotten,so,tired,of,any,one,word,in,my,life,as,'war,',unless,it's,'secession,',<END>
pa,talks,war,morning,noon,and,night,and,all,the,gentlemen,who,come,to,see,him,shout,about,fort,sumter,and,states',rights,and,abe,lincoln,till,i,get,so,bored,i,could,scream,<END>
and,that's,all,the,boys,talk,about,too,that,and,their,old,troop,<END>
there,hasn't,been,any,fun,at,any,party,this,spring,because,the,boys,can't,talk,about,anything,else,<END>
i'm,mighty,glad,georgia,waited,till,after,christmas,before,it,seceded,or,it,would,have,ruined,the,christmas,parties,too,<END>
if,you,say,'war',again,i'll,go,in,the,house,<END>
she,meant,what,she,said,for,she,could,never,long,endure,any,conversation,of,which,she,was,not,the,chief,subject,<END>
but,she,smiled,when,she,spoke,consciously,deepening,her,dimple,and,fluttering,her,bristly,black,lashes,as,swiftly,as,butterflies',wings,<END>
the,boys,were,enchanted,as,she,had,intended,them,to,be,and,they,hastened,to,apologize,for,boring,her,<END>
they,thought,none,the,less,of,her,for,her,lack,of,interest,<END>
indeed,they,thought,more,<END>
war,was,men's,business,not,ladies',and,they,took,her,attitude,as,evidence,of,her,femininity,<END>
having,maneuvered,them,away,from,the,boring,subject,of,war,she,went,back,with,interest,to,their,immediate,situation,<END>
what,did,your,mother,say,about,you,two,being,expelled,again,<END>
the,boys,looked,uncomfortable,recalling,their,mother's,conduct,three,months,ago,when,they,had,come,home,by,request,from,the,university,of,virginia,<END>
well,said,stuart,she,hasn't,had,a,chance,to,say,anything,yet,<END>
tom,and,us,left,home,early,this,morning,before,she,got,up,and,tom's,laying,out,over,at,the,fontaines',while,we,came,over,here,<END>
didn't,she,say,anything,when,you,got,home,last,night,<END>
we,were,in,luck,last,night,<END>
just,before,we,got,home,that,new,stallion,ma,got,in,kentucky,last,month,was,brought,in,and,the,place,was,in,a,stew,<END>
the,big,brute,he's,a,grand,horse,scarlett,you,must,tell,your,pa,to,come,over,and,see,him,right,away,he'd,already,bitten,a,hunk,out,of,his,groom,on,the,way,down,here,and,he'd,trampled,two,of,ma's,darkies,who,met,the,train,at,jonesboro,<END>
and,just,before,we,got,home,he'd,about,kicked,the,stable,down,and,half-killed,strawberry,ma's,old,stallion,<END>
when,we,got,home,ma,was,out,in,the,stable,with,a,sackful,of,sugar,smoothing,him,down,and,doing,it,mighty,well,too,<END>
the,darkies,were,hanging,from,the,rafters,popeyed,they,were,so,scared,but,ma,was,talking,to,the,horse,like,he,was,folks,and,he,was,eating,out,of,her,hand,<END>
there,ain't,nobody,like,ma,with,a,horse,<END>
and,when,she,saw,us,she,said,'in,heaven's,name,what,are,you,four,doing,home,again,<END>
you're,worse,than,the,plagues,of,egypt,',<END>
and,then,the,horse,began,snorting,and,rearing,and,she,said,'get,out,of,here,<END>
can't,you,see,he's,nervous,the,big,darling,<END>
i'll,tend,to,you,four,in,the,morning,',<END>
so,we,went,to,bed,and,this,morning,we,got,away,before,she,could,catch,us,and,left,boyd,to,handle,her,<END>
do,you,suppose,she'll,hit,boyd,<END>
scarlett,like,the,rest,of,the,county,could,never,get,used,to,the,way,small,mrs,tarleton,bullied,her,grown,sons,and,laid,her,riding,crop,on,their,backs,if,the,occasion,seemed,to,warrant,it,<END>
beatrice,tarleton,was,a,busy,woman,having,on,her,hands,not,only,a,large,cotton,plantation,a,hundred,negroes,and,eight,children,but,the,largest,horse-breeding,farm,in,the,state,as,well,<END>
she,was,hot-tempered,and,easily,plagued,by,the,frequent,scrapes,of,her,four,sons,and,while,no,one,was,permitted,to,whip,a,horse,or,a,slave,she,felt,that,a,lick,now,and,then,didn't,do,the,boys,any,harm,<END>
of,course,she,won't,hit,boyd,<END>
she,never,did,beat,boyd,much,because,he's,the,oldest,and,besides,he's,the,runt,of,the,litter,said,stuart,proud,of,his,six,feet,two,<END>
that's,why,we,left,him,at,home,to,explain,things,to,her,<END>
god'lmighty,ma,ought,to,stop,licking,us,<END>
we're,nineteen,and,tom's,twenty-one,and,she,acts,like,we're,six,years,old,<END>
will,your,mother,ride,the,new,horse,to,the,wilkes,barbecue,tomorrow,<END>
she,wants,to,but,pa,says,he's,too,dangerous,<END>
and,anyway,the,girls,won't,let,her,<END>
they,said,they,were,going,to,have,her,go,to,one,party,at,least,like,a,lady,riding,in,the,carriage,<END>
i,hope,it,doesn't,rain,tomorrow,said,scarlett,<END>
it's,rained,nearly,every,day,for,a,week,<END>
there's,nothing,worse,than,a,barbecue,turned,into,an,indoor,picnic,<END>
oh,it'll,be,clear,tomorrow,and,hot,as,june,said,stuart,<END>
look,at,that,sunset,<END>
i,never,saw,one,redder,<END>
you,can,always,tell,weather,by,sunsets,<END>
they,looked,out,across,the,endless,acres,of,gerald,o'hara's,newly,plowed,cotton,fields,toward,the,red,horizon,<END>
now,that,the,sun,was,setting,in,a,welter,of,crimson,behind,the,hills,across,the,flint,river,the,warmth,of,the,april,day,was,ebbing,into,a,faint,but,balmy,chill,<END>
spring,had,come,early,that,year,with,warm,quick,rains,and,sudden,frothing,of,pink,peach,blossoms,and,dogwood,dappling,with,white,stars,the,dark,river,swamp,and,far-off,hills,<END>
already,the,plowing,was,nearly,finished,and,the,bloody,glory,of,the,sunset,colored,the,fresh-cut,furrows,of,red,georgia,clay,to,even,redder,hues,<END>
the,moist,hungry,earth,waiting,upturned,for,the,cotton,seeds,showed,pinkish,on,the,sandy,tops,of,furrows,vermilion,and,scarlet,and,maroon,where,shadows,lay,along,the,sides,of,the,trenches,<END>
the,whitewashed,brick,plantation,house,seemed,an,island,set,in,a,wild,red,sea,a,sea,of,spiraling,curving,crescent,billows,petrified,suddenly,at,the,moment,when,the,pink-tipped,waves,were,breaking,into,surf,<END>
for,here,were,no,long,straight,furrows,such,as,could,be,seen,in,the,yellow,clay,fields,of,the,flat,middle,georgia,country,or,in,the,lush,black,earth,of,the,coastal,plantations,<END>
the,rolling,foothill,country,of,north,georgia,was,plowed,in,a,million,curves,to,keep,the,rich,earth,from,washing,down,into,the,river,bottoms,<END>
it,was,a,savagely,red,land,blood-colored,after,rains,brick,dust,in,droughts,the,best,cotton,land,in,the,world,<END>
it,was,a,pleasant,land,of,white,houses,peaceful,plowed,fields,and,sluggish,yellow,rivers,but,a,land,of,contrasts,of,brightest,sun,glare,and,densest,shade,<END>
the,plantation,clearings,and,miles,of,cotton,fields,smiled,up,to,a,warm,sun,placid,complacent,<END>
at,their,edges,rose,the,virgin,forests,dark,and,cool,even,in,the,hottest,noons,mysterious,a,little,sinister,the,soughing,pines,seeming,to,wait,with,an,age-old,patience,to,threaten,with,soft,sighs,be,careful,<END>
be,careful,<END>
we,had,you,once,<END>
we,can,take,you,back,again,<END>
to,the,ears,of,the,three,on,the,porch,came,the,sounds,of,hooves,the,jingling,of,harness,chains,and,the,shrill,careless,laughter,of,negro,voices,as,the,field,hands,and,mules,came,in,from,the,fields,<END>
from,within,the,house,floated,the,soft,voice,of,scarlett's,mother,ellen,o'hara,as,she,called,to,the,little,black,girl,who,carried,her,basket,of,keys,<END>
the,high-pitched,childish,voice,answered,yas'm,and,there,were,sounds,of,footsteps,going,out,the,back,way,toward,the,smokehouse,where,ellen,would,ration,out,the,food,to,the,home-coming,hands,<END>
there,was,the,click,of,china,and,the,rattle,of,silver,as,pork,the,valet-butler,of,tara,laid,the,table,for,supper,<END>
at,these,last,sounds,the,twins,realized,it,was,time,they,were,starting,home,<END>
but,they,were,loath,to,face,their,mother,and,they,lingered,on,the,porch,of,tara,momentarily,expecting,scarlett,to,give,them,an,invitation,to,supper,<END>
look,scarlett,<END>
about,tomorrow,said,brent,<END>
just,because,we've,been,away,and,didn't,know,about,the,barbecue,and,the,ball,that's,no,reason,why,we,shouldn't,get,plenty,of,dances,tomorrow,night,<END>
you,haven't,promised,them,all,have,you,<END>
well,i,have,<END>
how,did,i,know,you,all,would,be,home,<END>
i,couldn't,risk,being,a,wallflower,just,waiting,on,you,two,<END>
you,a,wallflower,<END>
the,boys,laughed,uproariously,<END>
look,honey,<END>
you've,got,to,give,me,the,first,waltz,and,stu,the,last,one,and,you've,got,to,eat,supper,with,us,<END>
we'll,sit,on,the,stair,landing,like,we,did,at,the,last,ball,and,get,mammy,jincy,to,come,tell,our,fortunes,again,<END>
i,don't,like,mammy,jincy's,fortunes,<END>
you,know,she,said,i,was,going,to,marry,a,gentleman,with,jet-black,hair,and,a,long,black,mustache,and,i,don't,like,black-haired,gentlemen,<END>
you,like,'em,red-headed,don't,you,honey,<END>
grinned,brent,<END>
now,come,on,promise,us,all,the,waltzes,and,the,supper,<END>
if,you'll,promise,we'll,tell,you,a,secret,said,stuart,<END>
what,<END>
cried,scarlett,alert,as,a,child,at,the,word,<END>
is,it,what,we,heard,yesterday,in,atlanta,stu,<END>
if,it,is,you,know,we,promised,not,to,tell,<END>
well,miss,pitty,told,us,<END>
miss,who,<END>
you,know,ashley,wilkes',cousin,who,lives,in,atlanta,miss,pittypat,hamilton,charles,and,melanie,hamilton's,aunt,<END>
i,do,and,a,sillier,old,lady,i,never,met,in,all,my,life,<END>
well,when,we,were,in,atlanta,yesterday,waiting,for,the,home,train,her,carriage,went,by,the,depot,and,she,stopped,and,talked,to,us,and,she,told,us,there,was,going,to,be,an,engagement,announced,tomorrow,night,at,the,wilkes,ball,<END>
oh,<END>
i,know,about,that,said,scarlett,in,disappointment,<END>
that,silly,nephew,of,hers,charlie,hamilton,and,honey,wilkes,<END>
everybody's,known,for,years,that,they'd,get,married,some,time,even,if,he,did,seem,kind,of,lukewarm,about,it,<END>
do,you,think,he's,silly,<END>
questioned,brent,<END>
last,christmas,you,sure,let,him,buzz,round,you,plenty,<END>
i,couldn't,help,him,buzzing,scarlett,shrugged,negligently,<END>
i,think,he's,an,awful,sissy,<END>
besides,it,isn't,his,engagement,that's,going,to,be,announced,said,stuart,triumphantly,<END>
it's,ashley's,to,charlie's,sister,miss,melanie,<END>
scarlett's,face,did,not,change,but,her,lips,went,white,like,a,person,who,has,received,a,stunning,blow,without,warning,and,who,in,the,first,moments,of,shock,does,not,realize,what,has,happened,<END>
so,still,was,her,face,as,she,stared,at,stuart,that,he,never,analytic,took,it,for,granted,that,she,was,merely,surprised,and,very,interested,<END>
miss,pitty,told,us,they,hadn't,intended,announcing,it,till,next,year,because,miss,melly,hasn't,been,very,well,but,with,all,the,war,talk,going,around,everybody,in,both,families,thought,it,would,be,better,to,get,married,soon,<END>
so,it's,to,be,announced,tomorrow,night,at,the,supper,intermission,<END>
now,scarlett,we've,told,you,the,secret,so,you've,got,to,promise,to,eat,supper,with,us,<END>
of,course,i,will,scarlett,said,automatically,<END>
and,all,the,waltzes,<END>
all,<END>
you're,sweet,<END>
i'll,bet,the,other,boys,will,be,hopping,mad,<END>
let,'em,be,mad,said,brent,<END>
we,two,can,handle,'em,<END>
look,scarlett,<END>
sit,with,us,at,the,barbecue,in,the,morning,<END>
what,<END>
stuart,repeated,his,request,<END>
of,course,<END>
the,twins,looked,at,each,other,jubilantly,but,with,some,surprise,<END>
although,they,considered,themselves,scarlett's,favored,suitors,they,had,never,before,gained,tokens,of,this,favor,so,easily,<END>
usually,she,made,them,beg,and,plead,while,she,put,them,off,refusing,to,give,a,yes,or,no,answer,laughing,if,they,sulked,growing,cool,if,they,became,angry,<END>
and,here,she,had,practically,promised,them,the,whole,of,tomorrow,seats,by,her,at,the,barbecue,all,the,waltzes,and,they'd,see,to,it,that,the,dances,were,all,waltzes,<END>
and,the,supper,intermission,<END>
this,was,worth,getting,expelled,from,the,university,<END>
filled,with,new,enthusiasm,by,their,success,they,lingered,on,talking,about,the,barbecue,and,the,ball,and,ashley,wilkes,and,melanie,hamilton,interrupting,each,other,making,jokes,and,laughing,at,them,hinting,broadly,for,invitations,to,supper,<END>
some,time,had,passed,before,they,realized,that,scarlett,was,having,very,little,to,say,<END>
the,atmosphere,had,somehow,changed,<END>
just,how,the,twins,did,not,know,but,the,fine,glow,had,gone,out,of,the,afternoon,<END>
scarlett,seemed,to,be,paying,little,attention,to,what,they,said,although,she,made,the,correct,answers,<END>
sensing,something,they,could,not,understand,baffled,and,annoyed,by,it,the,twins,struggled,along,for,a,while,and,then,rose,reluctantly,looking,at,their,watches,<END>
the,sun,was,low,across,the,new-plowed,fields,and,the,tall,woods,across,the,river,were,looming,blackly,in,silhouette,<END>
chimney,swallows,were,darting,swiftly,across,the,yard,and,chickens,ducks,and,turkeys,were,waddling,and,strutting,and,straggling,in,from,the,fields,<END>
stuart,bellowed,jeems,<END>
and,after,an,interval,a,tall,black,boy,of,their,own,age,ran,breathlessly,around,the,house,and,out,toward,the,tethered,horses,<END>

she's,not,crazy,about,him,<END>
it's,us,she's,crazy,about,<END>
brent,nodded,an,agreement,<END>
but,do,you,suppose,he,said,that,maybe,ashley,hadn't,told,her,he,was,going,to,announce,it,tomorrow,night,and,she,was,mad,at,him,for,not,telling,her,an,old,friend,before,he,told,everybody,else,<END>
girls,set,a,big,store,on,knowing,such,things,first,<END>
well,maybe,<END>

it,was,supposed,to,be,a,secret,and,a,surprise,and,a,man's,got,a,right,to,keep,his,own,engagement,quiet,hasn't,he,<END>
we,wouldn't,have,known,it,if,miss,melly's,aunt,hadn't,let,it,out,<END>
but,scarlett,must,have,known,he,was,going,to,marry,miss,melly,sometime,<END>
why,we've,known,it,for,years,<END>
the,wilkes,and,hamiltons,always,marry,their,own,cousins,<END>
everybody,knew,he'd,probably,marry,her,some,day,just,like,honey,wilkes,is,going,to,marry,miss,melly's,brother,charles,<END>
well,i,give,it,up,<END>
but,i'm,sorry,she,didn't,ask,us,to,supper,<END>
i,swear,i,don't,want,to,go,home,and,listen,to,ma,take,on,about,us,being,expelled,<END>
it,isn't,as,if,this,was,the,first,time,<END>
maybe,boyd,will,have,smoothed,her,down,by,now,<END>
you,know,what,a,slick,talker,that,little,varmint,is,<END>
you,know,he,always,can,smooth,her,down,<END>
yes,he,can,do,it,but,it,takes,boyd,time,<END>
he,has,to,talk,around,in,circles,till,ma,gets,so,confused,that,she,gives,up,and,tells,him,to,save,his,voice,for,his,law,practice,<END>
but,he,ain't,had,time,to,get,good,started,yet,<END>
why,i'll,bet,you,ma,is,still,so,excited,about,the,new,horse,that,she'll,never,even,realize,we're,home,again,till,she,sits,down,to,supper,tonight,and,sees,boyd,<END>
and,before,supper,is,over,she'll,be,going,strong,and,breathing,fire,<END>
and,it'll,be,ten,o'clock,before,boyd,gets,a,chance,to,tell,her,that,it,wouldn't,have,been,honorable,for,any,of,us,to,stay,in,college,after,the,way,the,chancellor,talked,to,you,and,me,<END>
and,it'll,be,midnight,before,he,gets,her,turned,around,to,where,she's,so,mad,at,the,chancellor,she'll,be,asking,boyd,why,he,didn't,shoot,him,<END>
no,we,can't,go,home,till,after,midnight,<END>
the,twins,looked,at,each,other,glumly,<END>
they,were,completely,fearless,of,wild,horses,shooting,affrays,and,the,indignation,of,their,neighbors,but,they,had,a,wholesome,fear,of,their,red-haired,mother's,outspoken,remarks,and,the,riding,crop,that,she,did,not,scruple,to,lay,across,their,breeches,<END>
well,look,said,brent,<END>
let's,go,over,to,the,wilkes,<END>
ashley,and,the,girls'll,be,glad,to,have,us,for,supper,<END>
stuart,looked,a,little,discomforted,<END>
no,don't,let's,go,there,<END>
they'll,be,in,a,stew,getting,ready,for,the,barbecue,tomorrow,and,besides,<END>
oh,i,forgot,about,that,said,brent,hastily,<END>
no,don't,let's,go,there,<END>
they,clucked,to,their,horses,and,rode,along,in,silence,for,a,while,a,flush,of,embarrassment,on,stuart's,brown,cheeks,<END>
until,the,previous,summer,stuart,had,courted,india,wilkes,with,the,approbation,of,both,families,and,the,entire,county,<END>
the,county,felt,that,perhaps,the,cool,and,contained,india,wilkes,would,have,a,quieting,effect,on,him,<END>
they,fervently,hoped,so,at,any,rate,<END>
and,stuart,might,have,made,the,match,but,brent,had,not,been,satisfied,<END>
brent,liked,india,but,he,thought,her,mighty,plain,and,tame,and,he,simply,could,not,fall,in,love,with,her,himself,to,keep,stuart,company,<END>
that,was,the,first,time,the,twins',interest,had,ever,diverged,and,brent,was,resentful,of,his,brother's,attentions,to,a,girl,who,seemed,to,him,not,at,all,remarkable,<END>
then,last,summer,at,a,political,speaking,in,a,grove,of,oak,trees,at,jonesboro,they,both,suddenly,became,aware,of,scarlett,o'hara,<END>
they,had,known,her,for,years,and,since,their,childhood,she,had,been,a,favorite,playmate,for,she,could,ride,horses,and,climb,trees,almost,as,well,as,they,<END>
but,now,to,their,amazement,she,had,become,a,grown-up,young,lady,and,quite,the,most,charming,one,in,all,the,world,<END>
they,noticed,for,the,first,time,how,her,green,eyes,danced,how,deep,her,dimples,were,when,she,laughed,how,tiny,her,hands,and,feet,and,what,a,small,waist,she,had,<END>
their,clever,remarks,sent,her,into,merry,peals,of,laughter,and,inspired,by,the,thought,that,she,considered,them,a,remarkable,pair,they,fairly,outdid,themselves,<END>
it,was,a,memorable,day,in,the,life,of,the,twins,<END>
thereafter,when,they,talked,it,over,they,always,wondered,just,why,they,had,failed,to,notice,scarlett's,charms,before,<END>
they,never,arrived,at,the,correct,answer,which,was,that,scarlett,on,that,day,had,decided,to,make,them,notice,<END>
she,was,constitutionally,unable,to,endure,any,man,being,in,love,with,any,woman,not,herself,and,the,sight,of,india,wilkes,and,stuart,at,the,speaking,had,been,too,much,for,her,predatory,nature,<END>
not,content,with,stuart,alone,she,had,set,her,cap,for,brent,as,well,and,with,a,thoroughness,that,overwhelmed,the,two,of,them,<END>
now,they,were,both,in,love,with,her,and,india,wilkes,and,letty,munroe,from,lovejoy,whom,brent,had,been,half-heartedly,courting,were,far,in,the,back,of,their,minds,<END>
just,what,the,loser,would,do,should,scarlett,accept,either,one,of,them,the,twins,did,not,ask,<END>
they,would,cross,that,bridge,when,they,came,to,it,<END>
for,the,present,they,were,quite,satisfied,to,be,in,accord,again,about,one,girl,for,they,had,no,jealousies,between,them,<END>
it,was,a,situation,which,interested,the,neighbors,and,annoyed,their,mother,who,had,no,liking,for,scarlett,<END>
it,will,serve,you,right,if,that,sly,piece,does,accept,one,of,you,she,said,<END>
or,maybe,she'll,accept,both,of,you,and,then,you'll,have,to,move,to,utah,if,the,mormons'll,have,you,which,i,doubt,<END>
all,that,bothers,me,is,that,some,one,of,these,days,you're,both,going,to,get,lickered,up,and,jealous,of,each,other,about,that,two-faced,little,green-eyed,baggage,and,you'll,shoot,each,other,<END>
but,that,might,not,be,a,bad,idea,either,<END>
since,the,day,of,the,speaking,stuart,had,been,uncomfortable,in,india's,presence,<END>
not,that,india,ever,reproached,him,or,even,indicated,by,look,or,gesture,that,she,was,aware,of,his,abruptly,changed,allegiance,<END>
she,was,too,much,of,a,lady,<END>
but,stuart,felt,guilty,and,ill,at,ease,with,her,<END>
he,knew,he,had,made,india,love,him,and,he,knew,that,she,still,loved,him,and,deep,in,his,heart,he,had,the,feeling,that,he,had,not,played,the,gentleman,<END>
he,still,liked,her,tremendously,and,respected,her,for,her,cool,good,breeding,her,book,learning,and,all,the,sterling,qualities,she,possessed,<END>
but,damn,it,she,was,just,so,pallid,and,uninteresting,and,always,the,same,beside,scarlett's,bright,and,changeable,charm,<END>
you,always,knew,where,you,stood,with,india,and,you,never,had,the,slightest,notion,with,scarlett,<END>
that,was,enough,to,drive,a,man,to,distraction,but,it,had,its,charm,<END>
well,let's,go,over,to,cade,calvert's,and,have,supper,<END>
scarlett,said,cathleen,was,home,from,charleston,<END>
maybe,she'll,have,some,news,about,fort,sumter,that,we,haven't,heard,<END>
not,cathleen,<END>
i'll,lay,you,two,to,one,she,didn't,even,know,the,fort,was,out,there,in,the,harbor,much,less,that,it,was,full,of,yankees,until,we,shelled,them,out,<END>
all,she'll,know,about,is,the,balls,she,went,to,and,the,beaux,she,collected,<END>
well,it's,fun,to,hear,her,gabble,<END>
and,it'll,be,somewhere,to,hide,out,till,ma,has,gone,to,bed,<END>
well,hell,<END>
i,like,cathleen,and,she,is,fun,and,i'd,like,to,hear,about,caro,rhett,and,the,rest,of,the,charleston,folks,but,i'm,damned,if,i,can,stand,sitting,through,another,meal,with,that,yankee,stepmother,of,hers,<END>
don't,be,too,hard,on,her,stuart,<END>
she,means,well,<END>
i'm,not,being,hard,on,her,<END>
i,feel,sorry,for,her,but,i,don't,like,people,i've,got,to,feel,sorry,for,<END>
and,she,fusses,around,so,much,trying,to,do,the,right,thing,and,make,you,feel,at,home,that,she,always,manages,to,say,and,do,just,exactly,the,wrong,thing,<END>
she,gives,me,the,fidgets,<END>
and,she,thinks,southerners,are,wild,barbarians,<END>
she,even,told,ma,so,<END>
she's,afraid,of,southerners,<END>
whenever,we're,there,she,always,looks,scared,to,death,<END>
she,reminds,me,of,a,skinny,hen,perched,on,a,chair,her,eyes,kind,of,bright,and,blank,and,scared,all,ready,to,flap,and,squawk,at,the,slightest,move,anybody,makes,<END>
well,you,can't,blame,her,<END>
you,did,shoot,cade,in,the,leg,<END>
well,i,was,lickered,up,or,i,wouldn't,have,done,it,said,stuart,<END>
and,cade,never,had,any,hard,feelings,<END>
neither,did,cathleen,or,raiford,or,mr,calvert,<END>
it,was,just,that,yankee,stepmother,who,squalled,and,said,i,was,a,wild,barbarian,and,decent,people,weren't,safe,around,uncivilized,southerners,<END>
well,you,can't,blame,her,<END>
she's,a,yankee,and,ain't,got,very,good,manners,and,after,all,you,did,shoot,him,and,he,is,her,stepson,<END>
well,hell,<END>
that's,no,excuse,for,insulting,me,<END>
you,are,ma's,own,blood,son,but,did,she,take,on,that,time,tony,fontaine,shot,you,in,the,leg,<END>
no,she,just,sent,for,old,doc,fontaine,to,dress,it,and,asked,the,doctor,what,ailed,tony's,aim,<END>
said,she,guessed,licker,was,spoiling,his,marksmanship,<END>
remember,how,mad,that,made,tony,<END>
both,boys,yelled,with,laughter,<END>
ma's,a,card,<END>
said,brent,with,loving,approval,<END>
you,can,always,count,on,her,to,do,the,right,thing,and,not,embarrass,you,in,front,of,folks,<END>
yes,but,she's,mighty,liable,to,talk,embarrassing,in,front,of,father,and,the,girls,when,we,get,home,tonight,said,stuart,gloomily,<END>
look,brent,<END>
i,guess,this,means,we,don't,go,to,europe,<END>
you,know,mother,said,if,we,got,expelled,from,another,college,we,couldn't,have,our,grand,tour,<END>

the,troop,knows,what,it's,doing,<END>
the,troop,of,cavalry,had,been,organized,three,months,before,the,very,day,that,georgia,seceded,from,the,union,and,since,then,the,recruits,had,been,whistling,for,war,<END>

but,the,next,time,came,and,went,and,the,result,was,nothing,nothing,except,that,the,fever,possessing,her,rose,higher,and,hotter,<END>
she,loved,him,and,she,wanted,him,and,she,did,not,understand,him,<END>
she,was,as,forthright,and,simple,as,the,winds,that,blew,over,tara,and,the,yellow,river,that,wound,about,it,and,to,the,end,of,her,days,she,would,never,be,able,to,understand,a,complexity,<END>
and,now,for,the,first,time,in,her,life,she,was,facing,a,complex,nature,<END>
for,ashley,was,born,of,a,line,of,men,who,used,their,leisure,for,thinking,not,doing,for,spinning,brightly,colored,dreams,that,had,in,them,no,touch,of,reality,<END>
he,moved,in,an,inner,world,that,was,more,beautiful,than,georgia,and,came,back,to,reality,with,reluctance,<END>
he,looked,on,people,and,he,neither,liked,nor,disliked,them,<END>
he,looked,on,life,and,was,neither,heartened,nor,saddened,<END>
he,accepted,the,universe,and,his,place,in,it,for,what,they,were,and,shrugging,turned,to,his,music,and,books,and,his,better,world,<END>
why,he,should,have,captivated,scarlett,when,his,mind,was,a,stranger,to,hers,she,did,not,know,<END>
the,very,mystery,of,him,excited,her,curiosity,like,a,door,that,had,neither,lock,nor,key,<END>
the,things,about,him,which,she,could,not,understand,only,made,her,love,him,more,and,his,odd,restrained,courtship,only,served,to,increase,her,determination,to,have,him,for,her,own,<END>
that,he,would,propose,some,day,she,had,never,doubted,for,she,was,too,young,and,too,spoiled,ever,to,have,known,defeat,<END>
and,now,like,a,thunderclap,had,come,this,horrible,news,<END>
ashley,to,marry,melanie,<END>
it,couldn't,be,true,<END>
why,only,last,week,when,they,were,riding,home,at,twilight,from,fairhill,he,had,said,scarlett,i,have,something,so,important,to,tell,you,that,i,hardly,know,how,to,say,it,<END>
she,had,cast,down,her,eyes,demurely,her,heart,beating,with,wild,pleasure,thinking,the,happy,moment,had,come,<END>
then,he,had,said,not,now,<END>
we're,nearly,home,and,there,isn't,time,<END>
oh,scarlett,what,a,coward,i,am,<END>
and,putting,spurs,to,his,horse,he,had,raced,her,up,the,hill,to,tara,<END>
scarlett,sitting,on,the,stump,thought,of,those,words,which,had,made,her,so,happy,and,suddenly,they,took,on,another,meaning,a,hideous,meaning,<END>
suppose,it,was,the,news,of,his,engagement,he,had,intended,to,tell,her,<END>
oh,if,pa,would,only,come,home,<END>
she,could,not,endure,the,suspense,another,moment,<END>
she,looked,impatiently,down,the,road,again,and,again,she,was,disappointed,<END>
the,sun,was,now,below,the,horizon,and,the,red,glow,at,the,rim,of,the,world,faded,into,pink,<END>
the,sky,above,turned,slowly,from,azure,to,the,delicate,blue-green,of,a,robin's,egg,and,the,unearthly,stillness,of,rural,twilight,came,stealthily,down,about,her,<END>
shadowy,dimness,crept,over,the,countryside,<END>
the,red,furrows,and,the,gashed,red,road,lost,their,magical,blood,color,and,became,plain,brown,earth,<END>
across,the,road,in,the,pasture,the,horses,mules,and,cows,stood,quietly,with,heads,over,the,split-rail,fence,waiting,to,be,driven,to,the,stables,and,supper,<END>
they,did,not,like,the,dark,shade,of,the,thickets,hedging,the,pasture,creek,and,they,twitched,their,ears,at,scarlett,as,if,appreciative,of,human,companionship,<END>
in,the,strange,half-light,the,tall,pines,of,the,river,swamp,so,warmly,green,in,the,sunshine,were,black,against,the,pastel,sky,an,impenetrable,row,of,black,giants,hiding,the,slow,yellow,water,at,their,feet,<END>
on,the,hill,across,the,river,the,tall,white,chimneys,of,the,wilkes',home,faded,gradually,into,the,darkness,of,the,thick,oaks,surrounding,them,and,only,far-off,pin,points,of,supper,lamps,showed,that,a,house,was,here,<END>
the,warm,damp,balminess,of,spring,encompassed,her,sweetly,with,the,moist,smells,of,new-plowed,earth,and,all,the,fresh,green,things,pushing,up,to,the,air,<END>
sunset,and,spring,and,new-fledged,greenery,were,no,miracle,to,scarlett,<END>
their,beauty,she,accepted,as,casually,as,the,air,she,breathed,and,the,water,she,drank,for,she,had,never,consciously,seen,beauty,in,anything,but,women's,faces,horses,silk,dresses,and,like,tangible,things,<END>
yet,the,serene,half-light,over,tara's,well-kept,acres,brought,a,measure,of,quiet,to,her,disturbed,mind,<END>
she,loved,this,land,so,much,without,even,knowing,she,loved,it,loved,it,as,she,loved,her,mother's,face,under,the,lamp,at,prayer,time,<END>
still,there,was,no,sign,of,gerald,on,the,quiet,winding,road,<END>
if,she,had,to,wait,much,longer,mammy,would,certainly,come,in,search,of,her,and,bully,her,into,the,house,<END>
but,even,as,she,strained,her,eyes,down,the,darkening,road,she,heard,a,pounding,of,hooves,at,the,bottom,of,the,pasture,hill,and,saw,the,horses,and,cows,scatter,in,fright,<END>
gerald,o'hara,was,coming,home,across,country,and,at,top,speed,<END>
he,came,up,the,hill,at,a,gallop,on,his,thick-barreled,long-legged,hunter,appearing,in,the,distance,like,a,boy,on,a,too,large,horse,<END>
his,long,white,hair,standing,out,behind,him,he,urged,the,horse,forward,with,crop,and,loud,cries,<END>
filled,with,her,own,anxieties,she,nevertheless,watched,him,with,affectionate,pride,for,gerald,was,an,excellent,horseman,<END>
i,wonder,why,he,always,wants,to,jump,fences,when,he's,had,a,few,drinks,she,thought,<END>
and,after,that,fall,he,had,right,here,last,year,when,he,broke,his,knee,<END>
you'd,think,he'd,learn,<END>
especially,when,he,promised,mother,on,oath,he'd,never,jump,again,<END>
scarlett,had,no,awe,of,her,father,and,felt,him,more,her,contemporary,than,her,sisters,for,jumping,fences,and,keeping,it,a,secret,from,his,wife,gave,him,a,boyish,pride,and,guilty,glee,that,matched,her,own,pleasure,in,outwitting,mammy,<END>
she,rose,from,her,seat,to,watch,him,<END>
the,big,horse,reached,the,fence,gathered,himself,and,soared,over,as,effortlessly,as,a,bird,his,rider,yelling,enthusiastically,his,crop,beating,the,air,his,white,curls,jerking,out,behind,him,<END>
gerald,did,not,see,his,daughter,in,the,shadow,of,the,trees,and,he,drew,rein,in,the,road,patting,his,horse's,neck,with,approbation,<END>
there's,none,in,the,county,can,touch,you,nor,in,the,state,he,informed,his,mount,with,pride,the,brogue,of,county,meath,still,heavy,on,his,tongue,in,spite,of,thirty-nine,years,in,america,<END>
then,he,hastily,set,about,smoothing,his,hair,and,settling,his,ruffled,shirt,and,his,cravat,which,had,slipped,awry,behind,one,ear,<END>
scarlett,knew,these,hurried,preenings,were,being,made,with,an,eye,toward,meeting,his,wife,with,the,appearance,of,a,gentleman,who,had,ridden,sedately,home,from,a,call,on,a,neighbor,<END>
she,knew,also,that,he,was,presenting,her,with,just,the,opportunity,she,wanted,for,opening,the,conversation,without,revealing,her,true,purpose,<END>
she,laughed,aloud,<END>
as,she,had,intended,gerald,was,startled,by,the,sound,then,he,recognized,her,and,a,look,both,sheepish,and,defiant,came,over,his,florid,face,<END>
he,dismounted,with,difficulty,because,his,knee,was,stiff,and,slipping,the,reins,over,his,arm,stumped,toward,her,<END>
well,missy,he,said,pinching,her,cheek,so,you've,been,spying,on,me,and,like,your,sister,suellen,last,week,you'll,be,telling,your,mother,on,me,<END>
there,was,indignation,in,his,hoarse,bass,voice,but,also,a,wheedling,note,and,scarlett,teasingly,clicked,her,tongue,against,her,teeth,as,she,reached,out,to,pull,his,cravat,into,place,<END>
his,breath,in,her,face,was,strong,with,bourbon,whisky,mingled,with,a,faint,fragrance,of,mint,<END>
accompanying,him,also,were,the,smells,of,chewing,tobacco,well-oiled,leather,and,horses,a,combination,of,odors,that,she,always,associated,with,her,father,and,instinctively,liked,in,other,men,<END>
no,pa,i'm,no,tattletale,like,suellen,she,assured,him,standing,off,to,view,his,rearranged,attire,with,a,judicious,air,<END>
gerald,was,a,small,man,little,more,than,five,feet,tall,but,so,heavy,of,barrel,and,thick,of,neck,that,his,appearance,when,seated,led,strangers,to,think,him,a,larger,man,<END>
his,thickset,torso,was,supported,by,short,sturdy,legs,always,incased,in,the,finest,leather,boots,procurable,and,always,planted,wide,apart,like,a,swaggering,small,boy's,<END>
most,small,people,who,take,themselves,seriously,are,a,little,ridiculous,but,the,bantam,cock,is,respected,in,the,barnyard,and,so,it,was,with,gerald,<END>
no,one,would,ever,have,the,temerity,to,think,of,gerald,o'hara,as,a,ridiculous,little,figure,<END>
he,was,sixty,years,old,and,his,crisp,curly,hair,was,silver-white,but,his,shrewd,face,was,unlined,and,his,hard,little,blue,eyes,were,young,with,the,unworried,youthfulness,of,one,who,has,never,taxed,his,brain,with,problems,more,abstract,than,how,many,cards,to,draw,in,a,poker,game,<END>
his,was,as,irish,a,face,as,could,be,found,in,the,length,and,breadth,of,the,homeland,he,had,left,so,long,ago,round,high,colored,short,nosed,wide,mouthed,and,belligerent,<END>
beneath,his,choleric,exterior,gerald,o'hara,had,the,tenderest,of,hearts,<END>
he,could,not,bear,to,see,a,slave,pouting,under,a,reprimand,no,matter,how,well,deserved,or,hear,a,kitten,mewing,or,a,child,crying,but,he,had,a,horror,of,having,this,weakness,discovered,<END>
that,everyone,who,met,him,did,discover,his,kindly,heart,within,five,minutes,was,unknown,to,him,and,his,vanity,would,have,suffered,tremendously,if,he,had,found,it,out,for,he,liked,to,think,that,when,he,bawled,orders,at,the,top,of,his,voice,everyone,trembled,and,obeyed,<END>
it,had,never,occurred,to,him,that,only,one,voice,was,obeyed,on,the,plantation,the,soft,voice,of,his,wife,ellen,<END>
it,was,a,secret,he,would,never,learn,for,everyone,from,ellen,down,to,the,stupidest,field,hand,was,in,a,tacit,and,kindly,conspiracy,to,keep,him,believing,that,his,word,was,law,<END>
scarlett,was,impressed,less,than,anyone,else,by,his,tempers,and,his,roarings,<END>
she,was,his,oldest,child,and,now,that,gerald,knew,there,would,be,no,more,sons,to,follow,the,three,who,lay,in,the,family,burying,ground,he,had,drifted,into,a,habit,of,treating,her,in,a,man-to-man,manner,which,she,found,most,pleasant,<END>
she,was,more,like,her,father,than,her,younger,sisters,for,carreen,who,had,been,born,caroline,irene,was,delicate,and,dreamy,and,suellen,christened,susan,elinor,prided,herself,on,her,elegance,and,ladylike,deportment,<END>
moreover,scarlett,and,her,father,were,bound,together,by,a,mutual,suppression,agreement,<END>
if,gerald,caught,her,climbing,a,fence,instead,of,walking,half,a,mile,to,a,gate,or,sitting,too,late,on,the,front,steps,with,a,beau,he,castigated,her,personally,and,with,vehemence,but,he,did,not,mention,the,fact,to,ellen,or,to,mammy,<END>
and,when,scarlett,discovered,him,jumping,fences,after,his,solemn,promise,to,his,wife,or,learned,the,exact,amount,of,his,losses,at,poker,as,she,always,did,from,county,gossip,she,refrained,from,mentioning,the,fact,at,the,supper,table,in,the,artfully,artless,manner,suellen,had,<END>
scarlett,and,her,father,each,assured,the,other,solemnly,that,to,bring,such,matters,to,the,ears,of,ellen,would,only,hurt,her,and,nothing,would,induce,them,to,wound,her,gentleness,<END>
scarlett,looked,at,her,father,in,the,fading,light,and,without,knowing,why,she,found,it,comforting,to,be,in,his,presence,<END>
there,was,something,vital,and,earthy,and,coarse,about,him,that,appealed,to,her,<END>
being,the,least,analytic,of,people,she,did,not,realize,that,this,was,because,she,possessed,in,some,degree,these,same,qualities,despite,sixteen,years,of,effort,on,the,part,of,ellen,and,mammy,to,obliterate,them,<END>
you,look,very,presentable,now,she,said,and,i,don't,think,anyone,will,suspect,you've,been,up,to,your,tricks,unless,you,brag,about,them,<END>
but,it,does,seem,to,me,that,after,you,broke,your,knee,last,year,jumping,that,same,fence,<END>
well,may,i,be,damned,if,i'll,have,me,own,daughter,telling,me,what,i,shall,jump,and,not,jump,he,shouted,giving,her,cheek,another,pinch,<END>
it's,me,own,neck,so,it,is,<END>
and,besides,missy,what,are,you,doing,out,here,without,your,shawl,<END>
seeing,that,he,was,employing,familiar,maneuvers,to,extricate,himself,from,unpleasant,conversation,she,slipped,her,arm,through,his,and,said,i,was,waiting,for,you,<END>
i,didn't,know,you,would,be,so,late,<END>
i,just,wondered,if,you,had,bought,dilcey,<END>
bought,her,i,did,and,the,price,has,ruined,me,<END>
bought,her,and,her,little,wench,prissy,<END>
john,wilkes,was,for,almost,giving,them,away,but,never,will,i,have,it,said,that,gerald,o'hara,used,friendship,in,a,trade,<END>
i,made,him,take,three,thousand,for,the,two,of,them,<END>
in,the,name,of,heaven,pa,three,thousand,<END>
and,you,didn't,need,to,buy,prissy,<END>
has,the,time,come,when,me,own,daughters,sit,in,judgment,on,me,<END>
shouted,gerald,rhetorically,<END>
prissy,is,a,likely,little,wench,and,so,<END>
i,know,her,<END>
she's,a,sly,stupid,creature,scarlett,rejoined,calmly,unimpressed,by,his,uproar,<END>
and,the,only,reason,you,bought,her,was,because,dilcey,asked,you,to,buy,her,<END>
gerald,looked,crestfallen,and,embarrassed,as,always,when,caught,in,a,kind,deed,and,scarlett,laughed,outright,at,his,transparency,<END>
well,what,if,i,did,<END>
was,there,any,use,buying,dilcey,if,she,was,going,to,mope,about,the,child,<END>
well,never,again,will,i,let,a,darky,on,this,place,marry,off,it,<END>
it's,too,expensive,<END>

the,shadows,were,falling,thicker,now,the,last,greenish,tinge,had,left,the,sky,and,a,slight,chill,was,displacing,the,balminess,of,spring,<END>
but,scarlett,loitered,wondering,how,to,bring,up,the,subject,of,ashley,without,permitting,gerald,to,suspect,her,motive,<END>
this,was,difficult,for,scarlett,had,not,a,subtle,bone,in,her,body,and,gerald,was,so,much,like,her,he,never,failed,to,penetrate,her,weak,subterfuges,even,as,she,penetrated,his,<END>
and,he,was,seldom,tactful,in,doing,it,<END>
how,are,they,all,over,at,twelve,oaks,<END>
about,as,usual,<END>
cade,calvert,was,there,and,after,i,settled,about,dilcey,we,all,set,on,the,gallery,and,had,several,toddies,<END>

scarlett,sighed,<END>
if,gerald,once,got,on,the,subject,of,war,and,secession,it,would,be,hours,before,he,relinquished,it,<END>
she,broke,in,with,another,line,<END>
did,they,say,anything,about,the,barbecue,tomorrow,<END>
now,that,i,think,of,it,they,did,<END>
miss,what's-her-name,the,sweet,little,thing,who,was,here,last,year,you,know,ashley's,cousin,oh,yes,miss,melanie,hamilton,that's,the,name,she,and,her,brother,charles,have,already,come,from,atlanta,and,<END>

come,now,daughter,don't,lag,<END>
your,mother,will,be,hunting,for,us,<END>
scarlett's,heart,sank,at,the,news,<END>
she,had,hoped,against,hope,that,something,would,keep,melanie,hamilton,in,atlanta,where,she,belonged,and,the,knowledge,that,even,her,father,approved,of,her,sweet,quiet,nature,so,different,from,her,own,forced,her,into,the,open,<END>
was,ashley,there,too,<END>
he,was,<END>
gerald,let,go,of,his,daughter's,arm,and,turned,peering,sharply,into,her,face,<END>
and,if,that's,why,you,came,out,here,to,wait,for,me,why,didn't,you,say,so,without,beating,around,the,bush,<END>
scarlett,could,think,of,nothing,to,say,and,she,felt,her,face,growing,red,with,annoyance,<END>
well,speak,up,<END>
still,she,said,nothing,wishing,that,it,was,permissible,to,shake,one's,father,and,tell,him,to,hush,his,mouth,<END>
he,was,there,and,he,asked,most,kindly,after,you,as,did,his,sisters,and,said,they,hoped,nothing,would,keep,you,from,the,barbecue,tomorrow,<END>
i'll,warrant,nothing,will,he,said,shrewdly,<END>
and,now,daughter,what's,all,this,about,you,and,ashley,<END>
there,is,nothing,she,said,shortly,tugging,at,his,arm,<END>
let's,go,in,pa,<END>
so,now,'tis,you,wanting,to,go,in,he,observed,<END>
but,here,i'm,going,to,stand,till,i'm,understanding,you,<END>
now,that,i,think,of,it,'tis,strange,you've,been,recently,<END>
has,he,been,trifling,with,you,<END>
has,he,asked,to,marry,you,<END>
no,she,said,shortly,<END>

fury,flamed,in,her,but,gerald,waved,her,quiet,with,a,hand,<END>
hold,your,tongue,miss,<END>
i,had,it,from,john,wilkes,this,afternoon,in,the,strictest,confidence,that,ashley's,to,marry,miss,melanie,<END>
it's,to,be,announced,tomorrow,<END>
scarlett's,hand,fell,from,his,arm,<END>
so,it,was,true,<END>
a,pain,slashed,at,her,heart,as,savagely,as,a,wild,animal's,fangs,<END>
through,it,all,she,felt,her,father's,eyes,on,her,a,little,pitying,a,little,annoyed,at,being,faced,with,a,problem,for,which,he,knew,no,answer,<END>
he,loved,scarlett,but,it,made,him,uncomfortable,to,have,her,forcing,her,childish,problems,on,him,for,a,solution,<END>
ellen,knew,all,the,answers,<END>
scarlett,should,have,taken,her,troubles,to,her,<END>
is,it,a,spectacle,you've,been,making,of,yourself,of,all,of,us,<END>
he,bawled,his,voice,rising,as,always,in,moments,of,excitement,<END>
have,you,been,running,after,a,man,who's,not,in,love,with,you,when,you,could,have,any,of,the,bucks,in,the,county,<END>
anger,and,hurt,pride,drove,out,some,of,the,pain,<END>
i,haven't,been,running,after,him,<END>
it,it,just,surprised,me,<END>
it's,lying,you,are,<END>
said,gerald,and,then,peering,at,her,stricken,face,he,added,in,a,burst,of,kindliness,i'm,sorry,daughter,<END>
but,after,all,you,are,nothing,but,a,child,and,there's,lots,of,other,beaux,<END>
mother,was,only,fifteen,when,she,married,you,and,i'm,sixteen,said,scarlett,her,voice,muffled,<END>
your,mother,was,different,said,gerald,<END>
she,was,never,flighty,like,you,<END>
now,come,daughter,cheer,up,and,i'll,take,you,to,charleston,next,week,to,visit,your,aunt,eulalie,and,what,with,all,the,hullabaloo,they,are,having,over,there,about,fort,sumter,you'll,be,forgetting,about,ashley,in,a,week,<END>
he,thinks,i'm,a,child,thought,scarlett,grief,and,anger,choking,utterance,and,he's,only,got,to,dangle,a,new,toy,and,i'll,forget,my,bumps,<END>
now,don't,be,jerking,your,chin,at,me,warned,gerald,<END>
if,you,had,any,sense,you'd,have,married,stuart,or,brent,tarleton,long,ago,<END>
think,it,over,daughter,<END>
marry,one,of,the,twins,and,then,the,plantations,will,run,together,and,jim,tarleton,and,i,will,build,you,a,fine,house,right,where,they,join,in,that,big,pine,grove,and,<END>

i,don't,want,to,go,to,charleston,or,have,a,house,or,marry,the,twins,<END>
i,only,want,she,caught,herself,but,not,in,time,<END>
gerald's,voice,was,strangely,quiet,and,he,spoke,slowly,as,if,drawing,his,words,from,a,store,of,thought,seldom,used,<END>
it's,only,ashley,you're,wanting,and,you'll,not,be,having,him,<END>
and,if,he,wanted,to,marry,you,'twould,be,with,misgivings,that,i'd,say,yes,for,all,the,fine,friendship,that's,between,me,and,john,wilkes,<END>
and,seeing,her,startled,look,he,continued,i,want,my,girl,to,be,happy,and,you,wouldn't,be,happy,with,him,<END>

the,white,children,clamored,to,sit,on,his,knee,and,be,trotted,while,he,denounced,to,their,elders,the,infamy,of,yankee,politicians,the,daughters,of,his,friends,took,him,into,their,confidence,about,their,love,affairs,and,the,youths,of,the,neighborhood,fearful,of,confessing,debts,of,honor,upon,the,carpets,of,their,fathers,found,him,a,friend,in,need,<END>

his,rough,manner,of,speech,was,too,well,known,to,give,offense,and,it,only,made,the,young,men,grin,sheepishly,and,reply,well,sir,i,hated,to,trouble,you,and,my,father,<END>
your,father's,a,good,man,and,no,denying,it,but,strict,and,so,take,this,and,let's,be,hearing,no,more,of,it,<END>

pork,the,only,trained,house,negro,on,the,place,had,general,supervision,over,the,other,servants,but,even,he,had,grown,slack,and,careless,after,several,years,of,exposure,to,gerald's,happy-go-lucky,mode,of,living,<END>
as,valet,he,kept,gerald's,bedroom,in,order,and,as,butler,he,served,the,meals,with,dignity,and,style,but,otherwise,he,pretty,well,let,matters,follow,their,own,course,<END>
with,unerring,african,instinct,the,negroes,had,all,discovered,that,gerald,had,a,loud,bark,and,no,bite,at,all,and,they,took,shameless,advantage,of,him,<END>
the,air,was,always,thick,with,threats,of,selling,slaves,south,and,of,direful,whippings,but,there,never,had,been,a,slave,sold,from,tara,and,only,one,whipping,and,that,administered,for,not,grooming,down,gerald's,pet,horse,after,a,long,day's,hunting,<END>
gerald's,sharp,blue,eyes,noticed,how,efficiently,his,neighbors',houses,were,run,and,with,what,ease,the,smooth-haired,wives,in,rustling,skirts,managed,their,servants,<END>
he,had,no,knowledge,of,the,dawn-till-midnight,activities,of,these,women,chained,to,supervision,of,cooking,nursing,sewing,and,laundering,<END>

gerald,upbraided,pork,for,his,impertinence,but,he,knew,that,he,was,right,<END>
he,wanted,a,wife,and,he,wanted,children,and,if,he,did,not,acquire,them,soon,it,would,be,too,late,<END>

but,there,were,two,difficulties,in,the,way,of,marriage,into,the,county,families,<END>
the,first,was,the,scarcity,of,girls,of,marriageable,age,<END>
the,second,and,more,serious,one,was,that,gerald,was,a,new,man,despite,his,nearly,ten,years',residence,and,a,foreigner,<END>
no,one,knew,anything,about,his,family,<END>
while,the,society,of,up-country,georgia,was,not,so,impregnable,as,that,of,the,coast,aristocrats,no,family,wanted,a,daughter,to,wed,a,man,about,whose,grandfather,nothing,was,known,<END>
gerald,knew,that,despite,the,genuine,liking,of,the,county,men,with,whom,he,hunted,drank,and,talked,politics,there,was,hardly,one,whose,daughter,he,could,marry,<END>
and,he,did,not,intend,to,have,it,gossiped,about,over,supper,tables,that,this,that,or,the,other,father,had,regretfully,refused,to,let,gerald,o'hara,pay,court,to,his,daughter,<END>
this,knowledge,did,not,make,gerald,feel,inferior,to,his,neighbors,<END>
nothing,could,ever,make,gerald,feel,that,he,was,inferior,in,any,way,to,anyone,<END>
it,was,merely,a,quaint,custom,of,the,county,that,daughters,only,married,into,families,who,had,lived,in,the,south,much,longer,than,twenty-two,years,had,owned,land,and,slaves,and,been,addicted,only,to,the,fashionable,vices,during,that,time,<END>

but,once,it's,selling,you,i'll,be,doing,for,they,are,words,i,seldom,say,meself,<END>
james,and,andrew,might,have,some,advice,to,offer,on,this,subject,of,marriage,and,there,might,be,daughters,among,their,old,friends,who,would,both,meet,his,requirements,and,find,him,acceptable,as,a,husband,<END>
james,and,andrew,listened,to,his,story,patiently,but,they,gave,him,little,encouragement,<END>
they,had,no,savannah,relatives,to,whom,they,might,look,for,assistance,for,they,had,been,married,when,they,came,to,america,<END>
and,the,daughters,of,their,old,friends,had,long,since,married,and,were,raising,small,children,of,their,own,<END>
you're,not,a,rich,man,and,you,haven't,a,great,family,said,james,<END>
i've,made,me,money,and,i,can,make,a,great,family,<END>
and,i,won't,be,marrying,just,anyone,<END>
you,fly,high,observed,andrew,dryly,<END>
but,they,did,their,best,for,gerald,<END>
james,and,andrew,were,old,men,and,they,stood,well,in,savannah,<END>
they,had,many,friends,and,for,a,month,they,carried,gerald,from,home,to,home,to,suppers,dances,and,picnics,<END>
there's,only,one,who,takes,me,eye,gerald,said,finally,<END>
and,she,not,even,born,when,i,landed,here,<END>
and,who,is,it,takes,your,eye,<END>
miss,ellen,robillard,said,gerald,trying,to,speak,casually,for,the,slightly,tilting,dark,eyes,of,ellen,robillard,had,taken,more,than,his,eye,<END>
despite,a,mystifying,listlessness,of,manner,so,strange,in,a,girl,of,fifteen,she,charmed,him,<END>
moreover,there,was,a,haunting,look,of,despair,about,her,that,went,to,his,heart,and,made,him,more,gentle,with,her,than,he,had,ever,been,with,any,person,in,all,the,world,<END>
and,you,old,enough,to,be,her,father,<END>
and,me,in,me,prime,<END>
cried,gerald,stung,<END>
james,spoke,gently,<END>
jerry,there's,no,girl,in,savannah,you'd,have,less,chance,of,marrying,<END>
her,father,is,a,robillard,and,those,french,are,proud,as,lucifer,<END>
and,her,mother,god,rest,her,soul,was,a,very,great,lady,<END>
i,care,not,said,gerald,heatedly,<END>
besides,her,mother,is,dead,and,old,man,robillard,likes,me,<END>
as,a,man,yes,but,as,a,son-in-law,no,<END>
the,girl,wouldn't,have,you,anyway,interposed,andrew,<END>
she's,been,in,love,with,that,wild,buck,of,a,cousin,of,hers,philippe,robillard,for,a,year,now,despite,her,family,being,at,her,morning,and,night,to,give,him,up,<END>
he's,been,gone,to,louisiana,this,month,now,said,gerald,<END>
and,how,do,you,know,<END>
i,know,answered,gerald,who,did,not,care,to,disclose,that,pork,had,supplied,this,valuable,bit,of,information,or,that,philippe,had,departed,for,the,west,at,the,express,desire,of,his,family,<END>
and,i,do,not,think,she's,been,so,much,in,love,with,him,that,she,won't,forget,him,<END>
fifteen,is,too,young,to,know,much,about,love,<END>
they'd,rather,have,that,breakneck,cousin,for,her,than,you,<END>
so,james,and,andrew,were,as,startled,as,anyone,when,the,news,came,out,that,the,daughter,of,pierre,robillard,was,to,marry,the,little,irishman,from,up,the,country,<END>
savannah,buzzed,behind,its,doors,and,speculated,about,philippe,robillard,who,had,gone,west,but,the,gossiping,brought,no,answer,<END>
why,the,loveliest,of,the,robillard,daughters,should,marry,a,loud-voiced,red-faced,little,man,who,came,hardly,up,to,her,ears,remained,a,mystery,to,all,<END>
gerald,himself,never,quite,knew,how,it,all,came,about,<END>
he,only,knew,that,a,miracle,had,happened,<END>
and,for,once,in,his,life,he,was,utterly,humble,when,ellen,very,white,but,very,calm,put,a,light,hand,on,his,arm,and,said,i,will,marry,you,mr,<END>
o'hara,<END>
the,thunderstruck,robillards,knew,the,answer,in,part,but,only,ellen,and,her,mammy,ever,knew,the,whole,story,of,the,night,when,the,girl,sobbed,till,the,dawn,like,a,broken-hearted,child,and,rose,up,in,the,morning,a,woman,with,her,mind,made,up,<END>
with,foreboding,mammy,had,brought,her,young,mistress,a,small,package,addressed,in,a,strange,hand,from,new,orleans,a,package,containing,a,miniature,of,ellen,which,she,flung,to,the,floor,with,a,cry,four,letters,in,her,own,handwriting,to,philippe,robillard,and,a,brief,letter,from,a,new,orleans,priest,announcing,the,death,of,her,cousin,in,a,barroom,brawl,<END>
they,drove,him,away,father,and,pauline,and,eulalie,<END>
they,drove,him,away,<END>
i,hate,them,<END>
i,hate,them,all,<END>
i,never,want,to,see,them,again,<END>
i,want,to,get,away,<END>
i,will,go,away,where,i'll,never,see,them,again,or,this,town,or,anyone,who,reminds,me,of,of,him,<END>
and,when,the,night,was,nearly,spent,mammy,who,had,cried,herself,out,over,her,mistress',dark,head,protested,but,honey,you,kain,do,dat,<END>
i,will,do,it,<END>
he,is,a,kind,man,<END>
i,will,do,it,or,go,into,the,convent,at,charleston,<END>
it,was,the,threat,of,the,convent,that,finally,won,the,assent,of,bewildered,and,heartstricken,pierre,robillard,<END>
he,was,staunchly,presbyterian,even,though,his,family,were,catholic,and,the,thought,of,his,daughter,becoming,a,nun,was,even,worse,than,that,of,her,marrying,gerald,o'hara,<END>
after,all,the,man,had,nothing,against,him,but,a,lack,of,family,<END>
so,ellen,no,longer,robillard,turned,her,back,on,savannah,never,to,see,it,again,and,with,a,middle-aged,husband,mammy,and,twenty,house,niggers,journeyed,toward,tara,<END>
the,next,year,their,first,child,was,born,and,they,named,her,katie,scarlett,after,gerald's,mother,<END>
gerald,was,disappointed,for,he,had,wanted,a,son,but,he,nevertheless,was,pleased,enough,over,his,small,black-haired,daughter,to,serve,rum,to,every,slave,at,tara,and,to,get,roaringly,happily,drunk,himself,<END>
if,ellen,had,ever,regretted,her,sudden,decision,to,marry,him,no,one,ever,knew,it,certainly,not,gerald,who,almost,burst,with,pride,whenever,he,looked,at,her,<END>
she,had,put,savannah,and,its,memories,behind,her,when,she,left,that,gently,mannered,city,by,the,sea,and,from,the,moment,of,her,arrival,in,the,county,north,georgia,was,her,home,<END>
when,she,departed,from,her,father's,house,forever,she,had,left,a,home,whose,lines,were,as,beautiful,and,flowing,as,a,woman's,body,as,a,ship,in,full,sail,a,pale,pink,stucco,house,built,in,the,french,colonial,style,set,high,from,the,ground,in,a,dainty,manner,approached,by,swirling,stairs,banistered,with,wrought,iron,as,delicate,as,lace,a,dim,rich,house,gracious,but,aloof,<END>
she,had,left,not,only,that,graceful,dwelling,but,also,the,entire,civilization,that,was,behind,the,building,of,it,and,she,found,herself,in,a,world,that,was,as,strange,and,different,as,if,she,had,crossed,a,continent,<END>
here,in,north,georgia,was,a,rugged,section,held,by,a,hardy,people,<END>
high,up,on,the,plateau,at,the,foot,of,the,blue,ridge,mountains,she,saw,rolling,red,hills,wherever,she,looked,with,huge,outcroppings,of,the,underlying,granite,and,gaunt,pines,towering,somberly,everywhere,<END>
it,all,seemed,wild,and,untamed,to,her,coast-,bred,eyes,accustomed,to,the,quiet,jungle,beauty,of,the,sea,islands,draped,in,their,gray,moss,and,tangled,green,the,white,stretches,of,beach,hot,beneath,a,semitropic,sun,the,long,flat,vistas,of,sandy,land,studded,with,palmetto,and,palm,<END>
this,was,a,section,that,knew,the,chill,of,winter,as,well,as,the,heat,of,summer,and,there,was,a,vigor,and,energy,in,the,people,that,was,strange,to,her,<END>
they,were,a,kindly,people,courteous,generous,filled,with,abounding,good,nature,but,sturdy,virile,easy,to,anger,<END>
the,people,of,the,coast,which,she,had,left,might,pride,themselves,on,taking,all,their,affairs,even,their,duels,and,their,feuds,with,a,careless,air,but,these,north,georgia,people,had,a,streak,of,violence,in,them,<END>
on,the,coast,life,had,mellowed,here,it,was,young,and,lusty,and,new,<END>
all,the,people,ellen,had,known,in,savannah,might,have,been,cast,from,the,same,mold,so,similar,were,their,view,points,and,traditions,but,here,was,a,variety,of,people,<END>
north,georgia's,settlers,were,coming,in,from,many,different,places,from,other,parts,of,georgia,from,the,carolinas,and,virginia,from,europe,and,the,north,<END>
some,of,them,like,gerald,were,new,people,seeking,their,fortunes,<END>
some,like,ellen,were,members,of,old,families,who,had,found,life,intolerable,in,their,former,homes,and,sought,haven,in,a,distant,land,<END>
many,had,moved,for,no,reason,at,all,except,that,the,restless,blood,of,pioneering,fathers,still,quickened,in,their,veins,<END>
these,people,drawn,from,many,different,places,and,with,many,different,backgrounds,gave,the,whole,life,of,the,county,an,informality,that,was,new,to,ellen,an,informality,to,which,she,never,quite,accustomed,herself,<END>
she,instinctively,knew,how,coast,people,would,act,in,any,circumstance,<END>
there,was,never,any,telling,what,north,georgians,would,do,<END>
and,quickening,all,of,the,affairs,of,the,section,was,the,high,tide,of,prosperity,then,rolling,over,the,south,<END>
all,of,the,world,was,crying,out,for,cotton,and,the,new,land,of,the,county,unworn,and,fertile,produced,it,abundantly,<END>
cotton,was,the,heartbeat,of,the,section,the,planting,and,the,picking,were,the,diastole,and,systole,of,the,red,earth,<END>

if,cotton,could,make,them,rich,in,one,generation,how,much,richer,they,would,be,in,the,next,<END>
this,certainty,of,the,morrow,gave,zest,and,enthusiasm,to,life,and,the,county,people,enjoyed,life,with,a,heartiness,that,ellen,could,never,understand,<END>
they,had,money,enough,and,slaves,enough,to,give,them,time,to,play,and,they,liked,to,play,<END>
they,seemed,never,too,busy,to,drop,work,for,a,fish,fry,a,hunt,or,a,horse,race,and,scarcely,a,week,went,by,without,its,barbecue,or,ball,<END>
ellen,never,would,or,could,quite,become,one,of,them,she,had,left,too,much,of,herself,in,savannah,but,she,respected,them,and,in,time,learned,to,admire,the,frankness,and,forthrightness,of,these,people,who,had,few,reticences,and,who,valued,a,man,for,what,he,was,<END>
she,became,the,best-loved,neighbor,in,the,county,<END>
she,was,a,thrifty,and,kind,mistress,a,good,mother,and,a,devoted,wife,<END>
the,heartbreak,and,selflessness,that,she,would,have,dedicated,to,the,church,were,devoted,instead,to,the,service,of,her,child,her,household,and,the,man,who,had,taken,her,out,of,savannah,and,its,memories,and,had,never,asked,any,questions,<END>

the,avenue,of,cedars,leading,from,the,main,road,to,the,house,that,avenue,of,cedars,without,which,no,georgia,planter's,home,could,be,complete,had,a,cool,dark,shadiness,that,gave,a,brighter,tinge,by,contrast,to,the,green,of,the,other,trees,<END>

it,was,not,the,lifting,up,of,her,heart,to,god,that,brought,this,balm,for,religion,went,no,more,than,lip,deep,with,her,<END>
it,was,the,sight,of,her,mother's,serene,face,upturned,to,the,throne,of,god,and,his,saints,and,angels,praying,for,blessings,on,those,whom,she,loved,<END>
when,ellen,intervened,with,heaven,scarlett,felt,certain,that,heaven,heard,<END>
ellen,finished,and,gerald,who,could,never,find,his,beads,at,prayer,time,began,furtively,counting,his,decade,on,his,fingers,<END>
as,his,voice,droned,on,scarlett's,thoughts,strayed,in,spite,of,herself,<END>
she,knew,she,should,be,examining,her,conscience,<END>

but,scarlett,was,examining,her,heart,<END>
she,dropped,her,head,upon,her,folded,hands,so,that,her,mother,could,not,see,her,face,and,her,thoughts,went,sadly,back,to,ashley,<END>
how,could,he,be,planning,to,marry,melanie,when,he,really,loved,her,scarlett,<END>
and,when,he,knew,how,much,she,loved,him,<END>
how,could,he,deliberately,break,her,heart,<END>
then,suddenly,an,idea,shining,and,new,flashed,like,a,comet,through,her,brain,<END>
why,ashley,hasn't,an,idea,that,i'm,in,love,with,him,<END>
she,almost,gasped,aloud,in,the,shock,of,its,unexpectedness,<END>
her,mind,stood,still,as,if,paralyzed,for,a,long,breathless,instant,and,then,raced,forward,<END>
how,could,he,know,<END>
i've,always,acted,so,prissy,and,ladylike,and,touch-me-not,around,him,he,probably,thinks,i,don't,care,a,thing,about,him,except,as,a,friend,<END>
yes,that's,why,he's,never,spoken,<END>
he,thinks,his,love,is,hopeless,<END>
and,that's,why,he's,looked,so,<END>
her,mind,went,swiftly,back,to,those,times,when,she,had,caught,him,looking,at,her,in,that,strange,manner,when,the,gray,eyes,that,were,such,perfect,curtains,for,his,thoughts,had,been,wide,and,naked,and,had,in,them,a,look,of,torment,and,despair,<END>
he's,been,broken,hearted,because,he,thinks,i'm,in,love,with,brent,or,stuart,or,cade,<END>
and,probably,he,thinks,that,if,he,can't,have,me,he,might,as,well,please,his,family,and,marry,melanie,<END>
but,if,he,knew,i,did,love,him,<END>
her,volatile,spirits,shot,up,from,deepest,depression,to,excited,happiness,<END>
this,was,the,answer,to,ashley's,reticence,to,his,strange,conduct,<END>
he,didn't,know,<END>
her,vanity,leaped,to,the,aid,of,her,desire,to,believe,making,belief,a,certainty,<END>
if,he,knew,she,loved,him,he,would,hasten,to,her,side,<END>
she,had,only,to,<END>

what,a,fool,i've,been,not,to,think,of,this,till,now,<END>
i,must,think,of,some,way,to,let,him,know,<END>
he,wouldn't,marry,her,if,he,knew,i,loved,him,<END>
how,could,he,<END>
with,a,start,she,realized,that,gerald,had,finished,and,her,mother's,eyes,were,on,her,<END>
hastily,she,began,her,decade,telling,off,the,beads,automatically,but,with,a,depth,of,emotion,in,her,voice,that,caused,mammy,to,open,her,eyes,and,shoot,a,searching,glance,at,her,<END>
as,she,finished,her,prayers,and,suellen,then,carreen,began,their,decades,her,mind,was,still,speeding,onward,with,her,entrancing,new,thought,<END>
even,now,it,wasn't,too,late,<END>
too,often,the,county,had,been,scandalized,by,elopements,when,one,or,the,other,of,the,participating,parties,was,practically,at,the,altar,with,a,third,<END>
and,ashley's,engagement,had,not,even,been,announced,yet,<END>
yes,there,was,plenty,of,time,<END>
if,no,love,lay,between,ashley,and,melanie,but,only,a,promise,given,long,ago,then,why,wasn't,it,possible,for,him,to,break,that,promise,and,marry,her,<END>
surely,he,would,do,it,if,he,knew,that,she,scarlett,loved,him,<END>
she,must,find,some,way,to,let,him,know,<END>
she,would,find,some,way,<END>
and,then,<END>
scarlett,came,abruptly,out,of,her,dream,of,delight,for,she,had,neglected,to,make,the,responses,and,her,mother,was,looking,at,her,reprovingly,<END>
as,she,resumed,the,ritual,she,opened,her,eyes,briefly,and,cast,a,quick,glance,around,the,room,<END>
the,kneeling,figures,the,soft,glow,of,the,lamp,the,dim,shadows,where,the,negroes,swayed,even,the,familiar,objects,that,had,been,so,hateful,to,her,sight,an,hour,ago,in,an,instant,took,on,the,color,of,her,own,emotions,and,the,room,seemed,once,more,a,lovely,place,<END>
she,would,never,forget,this,moment,or,this,scene,<END>
virgin,most,faithful,her,mother,intoned,<END>
the,litany,of,the,virgin,was,beginning,and,obediently,scarlett,responded,pray,for,us,as,ellen,praised,in,soft,contralto,the,attributes,of,the,mother,of,god,<END>
as,always,since,childhood,this,was,for,scarlett,a,moment,for,adoration,of,ellen,rather,than,the,virgin,<END>
sacrilegious,though,it,might,be,scarlett,always,saw,through,her,closed,eyes,the,upturned,face,of,ellen,and,not,the,blessed,virgin,as,the,ancient,phrases,were,repeated,<END>
health,of,the,sick,seat,of,wisdom,refuge,of,sinners,mystical,rose,they,were,beautiful,because,they,were,the,attributes,of,ellen,<END>
but,tonight,because,of,the,exaltation,of,her,own,spirit,scarlett,found,in,the,whole,ceremonial,the,softly,spoken,words,the,murmur,of,the,responses,a,surpassing,beauty,beyond,any,that,she,had,ever,experienced,before,<END>
and,her,heart,went,up,to,god,in,sincere,thankfulness,that,a,pathway,for,her,feet,had,been,opened,out,of,her,misery,and,straight,to,the,arms,of,ashley,<END>
when,the,last,amen,sounded,they,all,rose,somewhat,stiffly,mammy,being,hauled,to,her,feet,by,the,combined,efforts,of,teena,and,rosa,<END>
pork,took,a,long,spiller,from,the,mantelpiece,lit,it,from,the,lamp,flame,and,went,into,the,hall,<END>
opposite,the,winding,stair,stood,a,walnut,sideboard,too,large,for,use,in,the,dining,room,bearing,on,its,wide,top,several,lamps,and,a,long,row,of,candles,in,candlesticks,<END>
pork,lit,one,lamp,and,three,candles,and,with,the,pompous,dignity,of,a,first,chamberlain,of,the,royal,bedchamber,lighting,a,king,and,queen,to,their,rooms,he,led,the,procession,up,the,stairs,holding,the,light,high,above,his,head,<END>
ellen,on,gerald's,arm,followed,him,and,the,girls,each,taking,her,own,candlestick,mounted,after,them,<END>
scarlett,entered,her,room,set,the,candle,on,the,tall,chest,of,drawers,and,fumbled,in,the,dark,closet,for,the,dancing,dress,that,needed,stitching,<END>
throwing,it,across,her,arm,she,crossed,the,hall,quietly,<END>
the,door,of,her,parents',bedroom,was,slightly,ajar,and,before,she,could,knock,ellen's,voice,low,but,stern,came,to,her,ears,<END>
mr,o'hara,you,must,dismiss,jonas,wilkerson,<END>
gerald,exploded,<END>
and,where,will,i,be,getting,another,overseer,who,wouldn't,be,cheating,me,out,of,my,eyeteeth,<END>
he,must,be,dismissed,immediately,tomorrow,morning,<END>
big,sam,is,a,good,foreman,and,he,can,take,over,the,duties,until,you,can,hire,another,overseer,<END>
ah,ha,<END>
came,gerald's,voice,<END>
so,i,understand,<END>
then,the,worthy,jonas,sired,the,<END>
he,must,be,dismissed,<END>
so,he,is,the,father,of,emmie,slattery's,baby,thought,scarlett,<END>
oh,well,what,else,can,you,expect,from,a,yankee,man,and,a,white-,trash,girl,<END>
then,after,a,discreet,pause,which,gave,gerald's,splutterings,time,to,die,away,she,knocked,on,the,door,and,handed,the,dress,to,her,mother,<END>
by,the,time,scarlett,had,undressed,and,blown,out,the,candle,her,plan,for,tomorrow,had,worked,itself,out,in,every,detail,<END>
it,was,a,simple,plan,for,with,gerald's,single-mindedness,of,purpose,her,eyes,were,centered,on,the,goal,and,she,thought,only,of,the,most,direct,steps,by,which,to,reach,it,<END>
first,she,would,be,prideful,as,gerald,had,commanded,<END>
from,the,moment,she,arrived,at,twelve,oaks,she,would,be,her,gayest,most,spirited,self,<END>
no,one,would,suspect,that,she,had,ever,been,downhearted,because,of,ashley,and,melanie,<END>
and,she,would,flirt,with,every,man,there,<END>
that,would,be,cruel,to,ashley,but,it,would,make,him,yearn,for,her,all,the,more,<END>
she,wouldn't,overlook,a,man,of,marriageable,age,from,ginger-whiskered,old,frank,kennedy,who,was,suellen's,beau,on,down,to,shy,quiet,blushing,charles,hamilton,melanie's,brother,<END>
they,would,swarm,around,her,like,bees,around,a,hive,and,certainly,ashley,would,be,drawn,from,melanie,to,join,the,circle,of,her,admirers,<END>
then,somehow,she,would,maneuver,to,get,a,few,minutes,alone,with,him,away,from,the,crowd,<END>
she,hoped,everything,would,work,out,that,way,because,it,would,be,more,difficult,otherwise,<END>
but,if,ashley,didn't,make,the,first,move,she,would,simply,have,to,do,it,herself,<END>
when,they,were,finally,alone,he,would,have,fresh,in,his,mind,the,picture,of,the,other,men,thronging,about,her,he,would,be,newly,impressed,with,the,fact,that,every,one,of,them,wanted,her,and,that,look,of,sadness,and,despair,would,be,in,his,eyes,<END>
then,she,would,make,him,happy,again,by,letting,him,discover,that,popular,though,she,was,she,preferred,him,above,any,other,man,in,all,the,world,<END>
and,when,she,admitted,it,modestly,and,sweetly,she,would,look,a,thousand,things,more,<END>
of,course,she,would,do,it,all,in,a,ladylike,way,<END>
she,wouldn't,even,dream,of,saying,to,him,boldly,that,she,loved,him,that,would,never,do,<END>
but,the,manner,of,telling,him,was,a,detail,that,troubled,her,not,at,all,<END>
she,had,managed,such,situations,before,and,she,could,do,it,again,<END>
lying,in,the,bed,with,the,moonlight,streaming,dimly,over,her,she,pictured,the,whole,scene,in,her,mind,<END>
she,saw,the,look,of,surprise,and,happiness,that,would,come,over,his,face,when,he,realized,that,she,really,loved,him,and,she,heard,the,words,he,would,say,asking,her,to,be,his,wife,<END>
naturally,she,would,have,to,say,then,that,she,simply,couldn't,think,of,marrying,a,man,when,he,was,engaged,to,another,girl,but,he,would,insist,and,finally,she,would,let,herself,be,persuaded,<END>
then,they,would,decide,to,run,off,to,jonesboro,that,very,afternoon,and,<END>
why,by,this,time,tomorrow,night,she,might,be,mrs,ashley,wilkes,<END>
she,sat,up,in,bed,hugging,her,knees,and,for,a,long,happy,moment,she,was,mrs,ashley,wilkes,ashley's,bride,<END>
then,a,slight,chill,entered,her,heart,<END>
suppose,it,didn't,work,out,this,way,<END>
suppose,ashley,didn't,beg,her,to,run,away,with,him,<END>
resolutely,she,pushed,the,thought,from,her,mind,<END>
i,won't,think,of,that,now,she,said,firmly,<END>
if,i,think,of,it,now,it,will,upset,me,<END>
there's,no,reason,why,things,won't,come,out,the,way,i,want,them,if,he,loves,me,<END>
and,i,know,he,does,<END>
she,raised,her,chin,and,her,pale,black-fringed,eyes,sparkled,in,the,moonlight,<END>
ellen,had,never,told,her,that,desire,and,attainment,were,two,different,matters,life,had,not,taught,her,that,the,race,was,not,to,the,swift,<END>
she,lay,in,the,silvery,shadows,with,courage,rising,and,made,the,plans,that,a,sixteen-,year-old,makes,when,life,has,been,so,pleasant,that,defeat,is,an,impossibility,and,a,pretty,dress,and,a,clear,complexion,are,weapons,to,vanquish,fate,<END>
chapter,v,<END>
it,was,ten,o'clock,in,the,morning,<END>
the,day,was,warm,for,april,and,the,golden,sunlight,streamed,brilliantly,into,scarlett's,room,through,the,blue,curtains,of,the,wide,windows,<END>
the,cream-colored,walls,glowed,with,light,and,the,depths,of,the,mahogany,furniture,gleamed,deep,red,like,wine,while,the,floor,glistened,as,if,it,were,glass,except,where,the,rag,rugs,covered,it,and,they,were,spots,of,gay,color,<END>
already,summer,was,in,the,air,the,first,hint,of,georgia,summer,when,the,high,tide,of,spring,gives,way,reluctantly,before,a,fiercer,heat,<END>
a,balmy,soft,warmth,poured,into,the,room,heavy,with,velvety,smells,redolent,of,many,blossoms,of,newly,fledged,trees,and,of,the,moist,freshly,turned,red,earth,<END>
through,the,window,scarlett,could,see,the,bright,riot,of,the,twin,lanes,of,daffodils,bordering,the,graveled,driveway,and,the,golden,masses,of,yellow,jessamine,spreading,flowery,sprangles,modestly,to,the,earth,like,crinolines,<END>
the,mockingbirds,and,the,jays,engaged,in,their,old,feud,for,possession,of,the,magnolia,tree,beneath,her,window,were,bickering,the,jays,strident,acrimonious,the,mockers,sweet,voiced,and,plaintive,<END>
such,a,glowing,morning,usually,called,scarlett,to,the,window,to,lean,arms,on,the,broad,sill,and,drink,in,the,scents,and,sounds,of,tara,<END>
but,today,she,had,no,eye,for,sun,or,azure,sky,beyond,a,hasty,thought,thank,god,it,isn't,raining,<END>
on,the,bed,lay,the,apple-green,watered-silk,ball,dress,with,its,festoons,of,ecru,lace,neatly,packed,in,a,large,cardboard,box,<END>
it,was,ready,to,be,carried,to,twelve,oaks,to,be,donned,before,the,dancing,began,but,scarlett,shrugged,at,the,sight,of,it,<END>
if,her,plans,were,successful,she,would,not,wear,that,dress,tonight,<END>
long,before,the,ball,began,she,and,ashley,would,be,on,their,way,to,jonesboro,to,be,married,<END>
the,troublesome,question,was,what,dress,should,she,wear,to,the,barbecue,<END>
what,dress,would,best,set,off,her,charms,and,make,her,most,irresistible,to,ashley,<END>
since,eight,o'clock,she,had,been,trying,on,and,rejecting,dresses,and,now,she,stood,dejected,and,irritable,in,lace,pantalets,linen,corset,cover,and,three,billowing,lace,and,linen,petticoats,<END>

to,a,casual,observer,it,would,seem,that,years,had,passed,since,the,tarletons,had,seen,the,o'haras,instead,of,only,two,days,<END>

quick,though,her,brain,was,it,was,not,made,for,analysis,but,she,half-consciously,realized,that,for,all,the,tarleton,girls,were,as,unruly,as,colts,and,wild,as,march,hares,there,was,an,unworried,single-mindedness,about,them,that,was,part,of,their,inheritance,<END>

it's,all,wrong,this,marrying,of,cousins,<END>

you,can,breed,a,mare,to,a,brother,or,a,sire,to,a,daughter,and,get,good,results,if,you,know,your,blood,strains,but,in,people,it,just,doesn't,work,<END>

they,crossed,the,river,and,the,carriage,mounted,the,hill,<END>
even,before,twelve,oaks,came,into,view,scarlett,saw,a,haze,of,smoke,hanging,lazily,in,the,tops,of,the,tall,trees,and,smelled,the,mingled,savory,odors,of,burning,hickory,logs,and,roasting,pork,and,mutton,<END>
the,barbecue,pits,which,had,been,slowly,burning,since,last,night,would,now,be,long,troughs,of,rose-red,embers,with,the,meats,turning,on,spits,above,them,and,the,juices,trickling,down,and,hissing,into,the,coals,<END>
scarlett,knew,that,the,fragrance,carried,on,the,faint,breeze,came,from,the,grove,of,great,oaks,in,the,rear,of,the,big,house,<END>
john,wilkes,always,held,his,barbecues,there,on,the,gentle,slope,leading,down,to,the,rose,garden,a,pleasant,shady,place,and,a,far,pleasanter,place,for,instance,than,that,used,by,the,calverts,<END>
mrs,calvert,did,not,like,barbecue,food,and,declared,that,the,smells,remained,in,the,house,for,days,so,her,guests,always,sweltered,on,a,flat,unshaded,spot,a,quarter,of,a,mile,from,the,house,<END>
but,john,wilkes,famed,throughout,the,state,for,his,hospitality,really,knew,how,to,give,a,barbecue,<END>
the,long,trestled,picnic,tables,covered,with,the,finest,of,the,wilkeses',linen,always,stood,under,the,thickest,shade,with,backless,benches,on,either,side,and,chairs,hassocks,and,cushions,from,the,house,were,scattered,about,the,glade,for,those,who,did,not,fancy,the,benches,<END>
at,a,distance,great,enough,to,keep,the,smoke,away,from,the,guests,were,the,long,pits,where,the,meats,cooked,and,the,huge,iron,wash-pots,from,which,the,succulent,odors,of,barbecue,sauce,and,brunswick,stew,floated,<END>
mr,wilkes,always,had,at,least,a,dozen,darkies,busy,running,back,and,forth,with,trays,to,serve,the,guests,<END>
over,behind,the,barns,there,was,always,another,barbecue,pit,where,the,house,servants,and,the,coachmen,and,maids,of,the,guests,had,their,own,feast,of,hoecakes,and,yams,and,chitterlings,that,dish,of,hog,entrails,so,dear,to,negro,hearts,and,in,season,watermelons,enough,to,satiate,<END>
as,the,smell,of,crisp,fresh,pork,came,to,her,scarlett,wrinkled,her,nose,appreciatively,hoping,that,by,the,time,it,was,cooked,she,would,feel,some,appetite,<END>
as,it,was,she,was,so,full,of,food,and,so,tightly,laced,that,she,feared,every,moment,she,was,going,to,belch,<END>
that,would,be,fatal,as,only,old,men,and,very,old,ladies,could,belch,without,fear,of,social,disapproval,<END>
they,topped,the,rise,and,the,white,house,reared,its,perfect,symmetry,before,her,tall,of,columns,wide,of,verandas,flat,of,roof,beautiful,as,a,woman,is,beautiful,who,is,so,sure,of,her,charm,that,she,can,be,generous,and,gracious,to,all,<END>
scarlett,loved,twelve,oaks,even,more,than,tara,for,it,had,a,stately,beauty,a,mellowed,dignity,that,gerald's,house,did,not,possess,<END>
the,wide,curving,driveway,was,full,of,saddle,horses,and,carriages,and,guests,alighting,and,calling,greetings,to,friends,<END>
grinning,negroes,excited,as,always,at,a,party,were,leading,the,animals,to,the,barnyard,to,be,unharnessed,and,unsaddled,for,the,day,<END>
swarms,of,children,black,and,white,ran,yelling,about,the,newly,green,lawn,playing,hopscotch,and,tag,and,boasting,how,much,they,were,going,to,eat,<END>
the,wide,hall,which,ran,from,front,to,back,of,the,house,was,swarming,with,people,and,as,the,o'hara,carriage,drew,up,at,the,front,steps,scarlett,saw,girls,in,crinolines,bright,as,butterflies,going,up,and,coming,down,the,stairs,from,the,second,floor,arms,about,each,other's,waists,stopping,to,lean,over,the,delicate,handrail,of,the,banisters,laughing,and,calling,to,young,men,in,the,hall,below,them,<END>
through,the,open,french,windows,she,caught,glimpses,of,the,older,women,seated,in,the,drawing,room,sedate,in,dark,silks,as,they,sat,fanning,themselves,and,talking,of,babies,and,sicknesses,and,who,had,married,whom,and,why,<END>
the,wilkes,butler,tom,was,hurrying,through,the,halls,a,silver,tray,in,his,hands,bowing,and,grinning,as,he,offered,tall,glasses,to,young,men,in,fawn,and,gray,trousers,and,fine,ruffled,linen,shirts,<END>
the,sunny,front,veranda,was,thronged,with,guests,<END>
yes,the,whole,county,was,here,thought,scarlett,<END>
the,four,tarleton,boys,and,their,father,leaned,against,the,tall,columns,the,twins,stuart,and,brent,side,by,side,inseparable,as,usual,boyd,and,tom,with,their,father,james,tarleton,<END>
mr,calvert,was,standing,close,by,the,side,of,his,yankee,wife,who,even,after,fifteen,years,in,georgia,never,seemed,to,quite,belong,anywhere,<END>
everyone,was,very,polite,and,kind,to,her,because,he,felt,sorry,for,her,but,no,one,could,forget,that,she,had,compounded,her,initial,error,of,birth,by,being,the,governess,of,mr,calvert's,children,<END>
the,two,calvert,boys,raiford,and,cade,were,there,with,their,dashing,blonde,sister,cathleen,teasing,the,dark-faced,joe,fontaine,and,sally,munroe,his,pretty,bride-to-be,<END>
alex,and,tony,fontaine,were,whispering,in,the,ears,of,dimity,munroe,and,sending,her,into,gales,of,giggles,<END>
there,were,families,from,as,far,as,lovejoy,ten,miles,away,and,from,fayetteville,and,jonesboro,a,few,even,from,atlanta,and,macon,<END>
the,house,seemed,bursting,with,the,crowd,and,a,ceaseless,babble,of,talking,and,laughter,and,giggles,and,shrill,feminine,squeaks,and,screams,rose,and,fell,<END>
on,the,porch,steps,stood,john,wilkes,silver-haired,erect,radiating,the,quiet,charm,and,hospitality,that,was,as,warm,and,never,failing,as,the,sun,of,georgia,summer,<END>
beside,him,honey,wilkes,so,called,because,she,indiscriminately,addressed,everyone,from,her,father,to,the,field,hands,by,that,endearment,fidgeted,and,giggled,as,she,called,greetings,to,the,arriving,guests,<END>
honey's,nervously,obvious,desire,to,be,attractive,to,every,man,in,sight,contrasted,sharply,with,her,father's,poise,and,scarlett,had,the,thought,that,perhaps,there,was,something,in,what,mrs,tarleton,said,after,all,<END>
certainly,the,wilkes,men,got,the,family,looks,<END>
the,thick,deep-gold,lashes,that,set,off,the,gray,eyes,of,john,wilkes,and,ashley,were,sparse,and,colorless,in,the,faces,of,honey,and,her,sister,india,<END>
honey,had,the,odd,lashless,look,of,a,rabbit,and,india,could,be,described,by,no,other,word,than,plain,<END>
india,was,nowhere,to,be,seen,but,scarlett,knew,she,probably,was,in,the,kitchen,giving,final,instructions,to,the,servants,<END>
poor,india,thought,scarlett,she's,had,so,much,trouble,keeping,house,since,her,mother,died,that,she's,never,had,the,chance,to,catch,any,beau,except,stuart,tarleton,and,it,certainly,wasn't,my,fault,if,he,thought,i,was,prettier,than,she,<END>
john,wilkes,came,down,the,steps,to,offer,his,arm,to,scarlett,<END>
as,she,descended,from,the,carriage,she,saw,suellen,smirk,and,knew,that,she,must,have,picked,out,frank,kennedy,in,the,crowd,<END>
if,i,couldn't,catch,a,better,beau,than,that,old,maid,in,britches,<END>
she,thought,contemptuously,as,she,stepped,to,the,ground,and,smiled,her,thanks,to,john,wilkes,<END>
frank,kennedy,was,hurrying,to,the,carriage,to,assist,suellen,and,suellen,was,bridling,in,a,way,that,made,scarlett,want,to,slap,her,<END>
frank,kennedy,might,own,more,land,than,anyone,in,the,county,and,he,might,have,a,very,kind,heart,but,these,things,counted,for,nothing,against,the,fact,that,he,was,forty,slight,and,nervous,and,had,a,thin,ginger-colored,beard,and,an,old-maidish,fussy,way,about,him,<END>
however,remembering,her,plan,scarlett,smothered,her,contempt,and,cast,such,a,flashing,smile,of,greeting,at,him,that,he,stopped,short,his,arm,outheld,to,suellen,and,goggled,at,scarlett,in,pleased,bewilderment,<END>
scarlett's,eyes,searched,the,crowd,for,ashley,even,while,she,made,pleasant,small,talk,with,john,wilkes,but,he,was,not,on,the,porch,<END>
there,were,cries,of,greeting,from,a,dozen,voices,and,stuart,and,brent,tarleton,moved,toward,her,<END>
the,munroe,girls,rushed,up,to,exclaim,over,her,dress,and,she,was,speedily,the,center,of,a,circle,of,voices,that,rose,higher,and,higher,in,efforts,to,be,heard,above,the,din,<END>
but,where,was,ashley,<END>
and,melanie,and,charles,<END>
she,tried,not,to,be,obvious,as,she,looked,about,and,peered,down,the,hall,into,the,laughing,group,inside,<END>
as,she,chattered,and,laughed,and,cast,quick,glances,into,the,house,and,the,yard,her,eyes,fell,on,a,stranger,standing,alone,in,the,hall,staring,at,her,in,a,cool,impertinent,way,that,brought,her,up,sharply,with,a,mingled,feeling,of,feminine,pleasure,that,she,had,attracted,a,man,and,an,embarrassed,sensation,that,her,dress,was,too,low,in,the,bosom,<END>
he,looked,quite,old,at,least,thirty-five,<END>
he,was,a,tall,man,and,powerfully,built,<END>
scarlett,thought,she,had,never,seen,a,man,with,such,wide,shoulders,so,heavy,with,muscles,almost,too,heavy,for,gentility,<END>
when,her,eye,caught,his,he,smiled,showing,animal-white,teeth,below,a,close-clipped,black,mustache,<END>
he,was,dark,of,face,swarthy,as,a,pirate,and,his,eyes,were,as,bold,and,black,as,any,pirate's,appraising,a,galleon,to,be,scuttled,or,a,maiden,to,be,ravished,<END>
there,was,a,cool,recklessness,in,his,face,and,a,cynical,humor,in,his,mouth,as,he,smiled,at,her,and,scarlett,caught,her,breath,<END>
she,felt,that,she,should,be,insulted,by,such,a,look,and,was,annoyed,with,herself,because,she,did,not,feel,insulted,<END>
she,did,not,know,who,he,could,be,but,there,was,undeniably,a,look,of,good,blood,in,his,dark,face,<END>
it,showed,in,the,thin,hawk,nose,over,the,full,red,lips,the,high,forehead,and,the,wide-set,eyes,<END>
she,dragged,her,eyes,away,from,his,without,smiling,back,and,he,turned,as,someone,called,rhett,<END>
rhett,butler,<END>
come,here,<END>
i,want,you,to,meet,the,most,hardhearted,girl,in,georgia,<END>
rhett,butler,<END>
the,name,had,a,familiar,sound,somehow,connected,with,something,pleasantly,scandalous,but,her,mind,was,on,ashley,and,she,dismissed,the,thought,<END>
i,must,run,upstairs,and,smooth,my,hair,she,told,stuart,and,brent,who,were,trying,to,get,her,cornered,from,the,crowd,<END>
you,boys,wait,for,me,and,don't,run,off,with,any,other,girl,or,i'll,be,furious,<END>
she,could,see,that,stuart,was,going,to,be,difficult,to,handle,today,if,she,flirted,with,anyone,else,<END>
he,had,been,drinking,and,wore,the,arrogant,looking-for-a-fight,expression,that,she,knew,from,experience,meant,trouble,<END>
she,paused,in,the,hall,to,speak,to,friends,and,to,greet,india,who,was,emerging,from,the,back,of,the,house,her,hair,untidy,and,tiny,beads,of,perspiration,on,her,forehead,<END>
poor,india,<END>
it,would,be,bad,enough,to,have,pale,hair,and,eyelashes,and,a,jutting,chin,that,meant,a,stubborn,disposition,without,being,twenty,years,old,and,an,old,maid,in,the,bargain,<END>
she,wondered,if,india,resented,very,much,her,taking,stuart,away,from,her,<END>
lots,of,people,said,she,was,still,in,love,with,him,but,then,you,could,never,tell,what,a,wilkes,was,thinking,about,<END>
if,she,did,resent,it,she,never,gave,any,sign,of,it,treating,scarlett,with,the,same,slightly,aloof,kindly,courtesy,she,had,always,shown,her,<END>
scarlett,spoke,pleasantly,to,her,and,started,up,the,wide,stairs,<END>
as,she,did,a,shy,voice,behind,her,called,her,name,and,turning,she,saw,charles,hamilton,<END>
he,was,a,nice-looking,boy,with,a,riot,of,soft,brown,curls,on,his,white,forehead,and,eyes,as,deep,brown,as,clean,and,as,gentle,as,a,collie,dog's,<END>
he,was,well,turned,out,in,mustard-colored,trousers,and,black,coat,and,his,pleated,shirt,was,topped,by,the,widest,and,most,fashionable,of,black,cravats,<END>
a,faint,blush,was,creeping,over,his,face,as,she,turned,for,he,was,timid,with,girls,<END>
like,most,shy,men,he,greatly,admired,airy,vivacious,always-at-ease,girls,like,scarlett,<END>
she,had,never,given,him,more,than,perfunctory,courtesy,before,and,so,the,beaming,smile,of,pleasure,with,which,she,greeted,him,and,the,two,hands,outstretched,to,his,almost,took,his,breath,away,<END>
why,charles,hamilton,you,handsome,old,thing,you,<END>
i'll,bet,you,came,all,the,way,down,here,from,atlanta,just,to,break,my,poor,heart,<END>
charles,almost,stuttered,with,excitement,holding,her,warm,little,hands,in,his,and,looking,into,the,dancing,green,eyes,<END>
this,was,the,way,girls,talked,to,other,boys,but,never,to,him,<END>
he,never,knew,why,but,girls,always,treated,him,like,a,younger,brother,and,were,very,kind,but,never,bothered,to,tease,him,<END>
he,had,always,wanted,girls,to,flirt,and,frolic,with,him,as,they,did,with,boys,much,less,handsome,and,less,endowed,with,this,world's,goods,than,he,<END>
but,on,the,few,occasions,when,this,had,happened,he,could,never,think,of,anything,to,say,and,he,suffered,agonies,of,embarrassment,at,his,dumbness,<END>
then,he,lay,awake,at,night,thinking,of,all,the,charming,gallantries,he,might,have,employed,but,he,rarely,got,a,second,chance,for,the,girls,left,him,alone,after,a,trial,or,two,<END>
even,with,honey,with,whom,he,had,an,unspoken,understanding,of,marriage,when,he,came,into,his,property,next,fall,he,was,diffident,and,silent,<END>
at,times,he,had,an,ungallant,feeling,that,honey's,coquetries,and,proprietary,airs,were,no,credit,to,him,for,she,was,so,boy-crazy,he,imagined,she,would,use,them,on,any,man,who,gave,her,the,opportunity,<END>
charles,was,not,excited,over,the,prospect,of,marrying,her,for,she,stirred,in,him,none,of,the,emotions,of,wild,romance,that,his,beloved,books,had,assured,him,were,proper,for,a,lover,<END>
he,had,always,yearned,to,be,loved,by,some,beautiful,dashing,creature,full,of,fire,and,mischief,<END>
and,here,was,scarlett,o'hara,teasing,him,about,breaking,her,heart,<END>
he,tried,to,think,of,something,to,say,and,couldn't,and,silently,he,blessed,her,because,she,kept,up,a,steady,chatter,which,relieved,him,of,any,necessity,for,conversation,<END>
it,was,too,good,to,be,true,<END>

and,don't,you,go,off,philandering,with,those,other,girls,because,i'm,mighty,jealous,came,the,incredible,words,from,red,lips,with,a,dimple,on,each,side,and,briskly,black,lashes,swept,demurely,over,green,eyes,<END>
i,won't,he,finally,managed,to,breathe,never,dreaming,that,she,was,thinking,he,looked,like,a,calf,waiting,for,the,butcher,<END>
tapping,him,lightly,on,the,arm,with,her,folded,fan,she,turned,to,start,up,the,stairs,and,her,eyes,again,fell,on,the,man,called,rhett,butler,who,stood,alone,a,few,feet,away,from,charles,<END>
evidently,he,had,overheard,the,whole,conversation,for,he,grinned,up,at,her,as,maliciously,as,a,tomcat,and,again,his,eyes,went,over,her,in,a,gaze,totally,devoid,of,the,deference,she,was,accustomed,to,<END>
god's,nightgown,<END>
said,scarlett,to,herself,in,indignation,using,gerald's,favorite,oath,<END>
he,looks,as,if,as,if,he,knew,what,i,looked,like,without,my,shimmy,and,tossing,her,head,she,went,up,the,steps,<END>
in,the,bedroom,where,the,wraps,were,laid,she,found,cathleen,calvert,preening,before,the,mirror,and,biting,her,lips,to,make,them,look,redder,<END>
there,were,fresh,roses,in,her,sash,that,matched,her,cheeks,and,her,cornflower-blue,eyes,were,dancing,with,excitement,<END>
cathleen,said,scarlett,trying,to,pull,the,corsage,of,her,dress,higher,who,is,that,nasty,man,downstairs,named,butler,<END>
my,dear,don't,you,know,<END>
whispered,cathleen,excitedly,a,weather,eye,on,the,next,room,where,dilcey,and,the,wilkes,girls',mammy,were,gossiping,<END>
i,can't,imagine,how,mr,wilkes,must,feel,having,him,here,but,he,was,visiting,mr,kennedy,in,jonesboro,something,about,buying,cotton,and,of,course,mr,kennedy,had,to,bring,him,along,with,him,<END>
he,couldn't,just,go,off,and,leave,him,<END>
what,is,the,matter,with,him,<END>
my,dear,he,isn't,received,<END>
not,really,<END>
no,<END>
scarlett,digested,this,in,silence,for,she,had,never,before,been,under,the,same,roof,with,anyone,who,was,not,received,<END>
it,was,very,exciting,<END>
what,did,he,do,<END>
oh,scarlett,he,has,the,most,terrible,reputation,<END>
his,name,is,rhett,butler,and,he's,from,charleston,and,his,folks,are,some,of,the,nicest,people,there,but,they,won't,even,speak,to,him,<END>
caro,rhett,told,me,about,him,last,summer,<END>
he,isn't,any,kin,to,her,family,but,she,knows,all,about,him,everybody,does,<END>
he,was,expelled,from,west,point,<END>

and,for,things,too,bad,for,caro,to,know,<END>
and,then,there,was,that,business,about,the,girl,he,didn't,marry,<END>
do,tell,me,<END>
darling,don't,you,know,anything,<END>
caro,told,me,all,about,it,last,summer,and,her,mama,would,die,if,she,thought,caro,even,knew,about,it,<END>
well,this,mr,butler,took,a,charleston,girl,out,buggy,riding,<END>
i,never,did,know,who,she,was,but,i've,got,my,suspicions,<END>
she,couldn't,have,been,very,nice,or,she,wouldn't,have,gone,out,with,him,in,the,late,afternoon,without,a,chaperon,<END>
and,my,dear,they,stayed,out,nearly,all,night,and,walked,home,finally,saying,the,horse,had,run,away,and,smashed,the,buggy,and,they,had,gotten,lost,in,the,woods,<END>
and,guess,what,<END>
i,can't,guess,<END>
tell,me,said,scarlett,enthusiastically,hoping,for,the,worst,<END>
he,refused,to,marry,her,the,next,day,<END>
oh,said,scarlett,her,hopes,dashed,<END>
he,said,he,hadn't,er,done,anything,to,her,and,he,didn't,see,why,he,should,marry,her,<END>
and,of,course,her,brother,called,him,out,and,mr,butler,said,he'd,rather,be,shot,than,marry,a,stupid,fool,<END>
and,so,they,fought,a,duel,and,mr,butler,shot,the,girl's,brother,and,he,died,and,mr,butler,had,to,leave,charleston,and,now,nobody,receives,him,finished,cathleen,triumphantly,and,just,in,time,for,dilcey,came,back,into,the,room,to,oversee,the,toilet,of,her,charge,<END>
did,she,have,a,baby,<END>
whispered,scarlett,in,cathleen's,ear,<END>
cathleen,shook,her,head,violently,<END>
but,she,was,ruined,just,the,same,she,hissed,back,<END>
i,wish,i,had,gotten,ashley,to,compromise,me,thought,scarlett,suddenly,<END>
he'd,be,too,much,of,a,gentleman,not,to,marry,me,<END>
but,somehow,unbidden,she,had,a,feeling,of,respect,for,rhett,butler,for,refusing,to,marry,a,girl,who,was,a,fool,<END>
scarlett,sat,on,a,high,rosewood,ottoman,under,the,shade,of,a,huge,oak,in,the,rear,of,the,house,her,flounces,and,ruffles,billowing,about,her,and,two,inches,of,green,morocco,slippers,all,that,a,lady,could,show,and,still,remain,a,lady,peeping,from,beneath,them,<END>
she,had,scarcely,touched,plate,in,her,hands,and,seven,cavaliers,about,her,<END>
the,barbecue,had,reached,its,peak,and,the,warm,air,was,full,of,laughter,and,talk,the,click,of,silver,on,porcelain,and,the,rich,heavy,smells,of,roasting,meats,and,redolent,gravies,<END>
occasionally,when,the,slight,breeze,veered,puffs,of,smoke,from,the,long,barbecue,pits,floated,over,the,crowd,and,were,greeted,with,squeals,of,mock,dismay,from,the,ladies,and,violent,flappings,of,palmetto,fans,<END>
most,of,the,young,ladies,were,seated,with,partners,on,the,long,benches,that,faced,the,tables,but,scarlett,realizing,that,a,girl,has,only,two,sides,and,only,one,man,can,sit,on,each,of,these,sides,had,elected,to,sit,apart,so,she,could,gather,about,her,as,many,men,as,possible,<END>
under,the,arbor,sat,the,married,women,their,dark,dresses,decorous,notes,in,the,surrounding,color,and,gaiety,<END>
matrons,regardless,of,their,ages,always,grouped,together,apart,from,the,bright-eyed,girls,beaux,and,laughter,for,there,were,no,married,belles,in,the,south,<END>
from,grandma,fontaine,who,was,belching,frankly,with,the,privilege,of,her,age,to,seventeen-year-old,alice,munroe,struggling,against,the,nausea,of,a,first,pregnancy,they,had,their,heads,together,in,the,endless,genealogical,and,obstetrical,discussions,that,made,such,gatherings,very,pleasant,and,instructive,affairs,<END>
casting,contemptuous,glances,at,them,scarlett,thought,that,they,looked,like,a,clump,of,fat,crows,<END>
married,women,never,had,any,fun,<END>
it,did,not,occur,to,her,that,if,she,married,ashley,she,would,automatically,be,relegated,to,arbors,and,front,parlors,with,staid,matrons,in,dull,silks,as,staid,and,dull,as,they,and,not,a,part,of,the,fun,and,frolicking,<END>
like,most,girls,her,imagination,carried,her,just,as,far,as,the,altar,and,no,further,<END>
besides,she,was,too,unhappy,now,to,pursue,an,abstraction,<END>
she,dropped,her,eyes,to,her,plate,and,nibbled,daintily,on,a,beaten,biscuit,with,an,elegance,and,an,utter,lack,of,appetite,that,would,have,won,mammy's,approval,<END>
for,all,that,she,had,a,superfluity,of,beaux,she,had,never,been,more,miserable,in,her,life,<END>
in,some,way,that,she,could,not,understand,her,plans,of,last,night,had,failed,utterly,so,far,as,ashley,was,concerned,<END>
she,had,attracted,other,beaux,by,the,dozens,but,not,ashley,and,all,the,fears,of,yesterday,afternoon,were,sweeping,back,upon,her,making,her,heart,beat,fast,and,then,slow,and,color,flame,and,whiten,in,her,cheeks,<END>
ashley,had,made,no,attempt,to,join,the,circle,about,her,in,fact,she,had,not,had,a,word,alone,with,him,since,arriving,or,even,spoken,to,him,since,their,first,greeting,<END>
he,had,come,forward,to,welcome,her,when,she,came,into,the,back,garden,but,melanie,had,been,on,his,arm,then,melanie,who,hardly,came,up,to,his,shoulder,<END>
she,was,a,tiny,frailly,built,girl,who,gave,the,appearance,of,a,child,masquerading,in,her,mother's,enormous,hoop,skirts,an,illusion,that,was,heightened,by,the,shy,almost,frightened,look,in,her,too,large,brown,eyes,<END>
she,had,a,cloud,of,curly,dark,hair,which,was,so,sternly,repressed,beneath,its,net,that,no,vagrant,tendrils,escaped,and,this,dark,mass,with,its,long,widow's,peak,accentuated,the,heart,shape,of,her,face,<END>
too,wide,across,the,cheek,bones,too,pointed,at,the,chin,it,was,a,sweet,timid,face,but,a,plain,face,and,she,had,no,feminine,tricks,of,allure,to,make,observers,forget,its,plainness,<END>
she,looked,and,was,as,simple,as,earth,as,good,as,bread,as,transparent,as,spring,water,<END>
but,for,all,her,plainness,of,feature,and,smallness,of,stature,there,was,a,sedate,dignity,about,her,movements,that,was,oddly,touching,and,far,older,than,her,seventeen,years,<END>
her,gray,organdie,dress,with,its,cherry-colored,satin,sash,disguised,with,its,billows,and,ruffles,how,childishly,undeveloped,her,body,was,and,the,yellow,hat,with,long,cherry,streamers,made,her,creamy,skin,glow,<END>
her,heavy,earbobs,with,their,long,gold,fringe,hung,down,from,loops,of,tidily,netted,hair,swinging,close,to,her,brown,eyes,eyes,that,had,the,still,gleam,of,a,forest,pool,in,winter,when,brown,leaves,shine,up,through,quiet,water,<END>
she,had,smiled,with,timid,liking,when,she,greeted,scarlett,and,told,her,how,pretty,her,green,dress,was,and,scarlett,had,been,hard,put,to,be,even,civil,in,reply,so,violently,did,she,want,to,speak,alone,with,ashley,<END>
since,then,ashley,had,sat,on,a,stool,at,melanie's,feet,apart,from,the,other,guests,and,talked,quietly,with,her,smiling,the,slow,drowsy,smile,that,scarlett,loved,<END>
what,made,matters,worse,was,that,under,his,smile,a,little,sparkle,had,come,into,melanie's,eyes,so,that,even,scarlett,had,to,admit,that,she,looked,almost,pretty,<END>
as,melanie,looked,at,ashley,her,plain,face,lit,up,as,with,an,inner,fire,for,if,ever,a,loving,heart,showed,itself,upon,a,face,it,was,showing,now,on,melanie,hamilton's,<END>
scarlett,tried,to,keep,her,eyes,from,these,two,but,could,not,and,after,each,glance,she,redoubled,her,gaiety,with,her,cavaliers,laughing,saying,daring,things,teasing,tossing,her,head,at,their,compliments,until,her,earrings,danced,<END>
she,said,fiddle-dee-dee,many,times,declared,that,the,truth,wasn't,in,any,of,them,and,vowed,that,she'd,never,believe,anything,any,man,told,her,<END>
but,ashley,did,not,seem,to,notice,her,at,all,<END>
he,only,looked,up,at,melanie,and,talked,on,and,melanie,looked,down,at,him,with,an,expression,that,radiated,the,fact,that,she,belonged,to,him,<END>
so,scarlett,was,miserable,<END>
to,the,outward,eye,never,had,a,girl,less,cause,to,be,miserable,<END>
she,was,undoubtedly,the,belle,of,the,barbecue,the,center,of,attention,<END>
the,furore,she,was,causing,among,the,men,coupled,with,the,heart,burnings,of,the,other,girls,would,have,pleased,her,enormously,at,any,other,time,<END>
charles,hamilton,emboldened,by,her,notice,was,firmly,planted,on,her,right,refusing,to,be,dislodged,by,the,combined,efforts,of,the,tarleton,twins,<END>
he,held,her,fan,in,one,hand,and,his,untouched,plate,of,barbecue,in,the,other,and,stubbornly,refused,to,meet,the,eyes,of,honey,who,seemed,on,the,verge,of,an,outburst,of,tears,<END>
cade,lounged,gracefully,on,her,left,plucking,at,her,skirt,to,attract,her,attention,and,staring,up,with,smoldering,eyes,at,stuart,<END>
already,the,air,was,electric,between,him,and,the,twins,and,rude,words,had,passed,<END>
frank,kennedy,fussed,about,like,a,hen,with,one,chick,running,back,and,forth,from,the,shade,of,the,oak,to,the,tables,to,fetch,dainties,to,tempt,scarlett,as,if,there,were,not,a,dozen,servants,there,for,that,purpose,<END>
as,a,result,suellen's,sullen,resentment,had,passed,beyond,the,point,of,ladylike,concealment,and,she,glowered,at,scarlett,<END>
small,carreen,could,have,cried,because,for,all,scarlett's,encouraging,words,that,morning,brent,had,done,no,more,than,say,hello,sis,and,jerk,her,hair,ribbon,before,turning,his,full,attention,to,scarlett,<END>
usually,he,was,so,kind,and,treated,her,with,a,careless,deference,that,made,her,feel,grown,up,and,carreen,secretly,dreamed,of,the,day,when,she,would,put,her,hair,up,and,her,skirts,down,and,receive,him,as,a,real,beau,<END>
and,now,it,seemed,that,scarlett,had,him,<END>
the,munroe,girls,were,concealing,their,chagrin,at,the,defection,of,the,swarthy,fontaine,boys,but,they,were,annoyed,at,the,way,tony,and,alex,stood,about,the,circle,jockeying,for,a,position,near,scarlett,should,any,of,the,others,arise,from,their,places,<END>
they,telegraphed,their,disapproval,of,scarlett's,conduct,to,hetty,tarleton,by,delicately,raised,eyebrows,<END>
fast,was,the,only,word,for,scarlett,<END>
simultaneously,the,three,young,ladies,raised,lacy,parasols,said,they,had,had,quite,enough,to,eat,thank,you,and,laying,light,fingers,on,the,arms,of,the,men,nearest,them,clamored,sweetly,to,see,the,rose,garden,the,spring,and,the,summerhouse,<END>
this,strategic,retreat,in,good,order,was,not,lost,on,a,woman,present,or,observed,by,a,man,<END>
scarlett,giggled,as,she,saw,three,men,dragged,out,of,the,line,of,her,charms,to,investigate,landmarks,familiar,to,the,girls,from,childhood,and,cut,her,eye,sharply,to,see,if,ashley,had,taken,note,<END>
but,he,was,playing,with,the,ends,of,melanie's,sash,and,smiling,up,at,her,<END>
pain,twisted,scarlett's,heart,<END>
she,felt,that,she,could,claw,melanie's,ivory,skin,till,the,blood,ran,and,take,pleasure,in,doing,it,<END>
as,her,eyes,wandered,from,melanie,she,caught,the,gaze,of,rhett,butler,who,was,not,mixing,with,the,crowd,but,standing,apart,talking,to,john,wilkes,<END>
he,had,been,watching,her,and,when,she,looked,at,him,he,laughed,outright,<END>
scarlett,had,an,uneasy,feeling,that,this,man,who,was,not,received,was,the,only,one,present,who,knew,what,lay,behind,her,wild,gaiety,and,that,it,was,affording,him,sardonic,amusement,<END>
she,could,have,clawed,him,with,pleasure,too,<END>
if,i,can,just,live,through,this,barbecue,till,this,afternoon,she,thought,all,the,girls,will,go,upstairs,to,take,naps,to,be,fresh,for,tonight,and,i'll,stay,downstairs,and,get,to,talk,to,ashley,<END>
surely,he,must,have,noticed,how,popular,i,am,<END>
she,soothed,her,heart,with,another,hope,of,course,he,has,to,be,attentive,to,melanie,because,after,all,she,is,his,cousin,and,she,isn't,popular,at,all,and,if,he,didn't,look,out,for,her,she'd,just,be,a,wallflower,<END>
she,took,new,courage,at,this,thought,and,redoubled,her,efforts,in,the,direction,of,charles,whose,brown,eyes,glowed,down,eagerly,at,her,<END>
it,was,a,wonderful,day,for,charles,a,dream,day,and,he,had,fallen,in,love,with,scarlett,with,no,effort,at,all,<END>
before,this,new,emotion,honey,receded,into,a,dim,haze,<END>
honey,was,a,shrill-,voiced,sparrow,and,scarlett,a,gleaming,hummingbird,<END>
she,teased,him,and,favored,him,and,asked,him,questions,and,answered,them,herself,so,that,he,appeared,very,clever,without,having,to,say,a,word,<END>
the,other,boys,were,puzzled,and,annoyed,by,her,obvious,interest,in,him,for,they,knew,charles,was,too,shy,to,hitch,two,consecutive,words,together,and,politeness,was,being,severely,strained,to,conceal,their,growing,rage,<END>
everyone,was,smoldering,and,it,would,have,been,a,positive,triumph,for,scarlett,except,for,ashley,<END>
when,the,last,forkful,of,pork,and,chicken,and,mutton,had,been,eaten,scarlett,hoped,the,time,had,come,when,india,would,rise,and,suggest,that,the,ladies,retire,to,the,house,<END>
it,was,two,o'clock,and,the,sun,was,warm,overhead,but,india,wearied,with,the,three-,day,preparations,for,the,barbecue,was,only,too,glad,to,remain,sitting,beneath,the,arbor,shouting,remarks,to,a,deaf,old,gentleman,from,fayetteville,<END>
a,lazy,somnolence,descended,on,the,crowd,<END>
the,negroes,idled,about,clearing,the,long,tables,on,which,the,food,had,been,laid,<END>
the,laughter,and,talking,became,less,animated,and,groups,here,and,there,fell,silent,<END>
all,were,waiting,for,their,hostess,to,signal,the,end,of,the,morning's,festivities,<END>
palmetto,fans,were,wagging,more,slowly,and,several,gentlemen,were,nodding,from,the,heat,and,overloaded,stomachs,<END>
the,barbecue,was,over,and,all,were,content,to,take,their,ease,while,sun,was,at,its,height,<END>
in,this,interval,between,the,morning,party,and,the,evening's,ball,they,seemed,a,placid,peaceful,lot,<END>
only,the,young,men,retained,the,restless,energy,which,had,filled,the,whole,throng,a,short,while,before,<END>
moving,from,group,to,group,drawling,in,their,soft,voices,they,were,as,handsome,as,blooded,stallions,and,as,dangerous,<END>
the,languor,of,midday,had,taken,hold,of,the,gathering,but,underneath,lurked,tempers,that,could,rise,to,killing,heights,in,a,second,and,flare,out,as,quickly,<END>
men,and,women,they,were,beautiful,and,wild,all,a,little,violent,under,their,pleasant,ways,and,only,a,little,tamed,<END>
some,time,dragged,by,while,the,sun,grew,hotter,and,scarlett,and,others,looked,again,toward,india,<END>
conversation,was,dying,out,when,in,the,lull,everyone,in,the,grove,heard,gerald's,voice,raised,in,furious,accents,<END>
standing,some,little,distance,away,from,the,barbecue,tables,he,was,at,the,peak,of,an,argument,with,john,wilkes,<END>

now,we'll,all,sit,here,till,midnight,<END>
in,an,instant,the,somnolence,had,fled,from,the,lounging,throng,and,something,electric,went,snapping,through,the,air,<END>

all,scarlett,could,hear,was,states',rights,by,god,<END>
shouted,over,and,over,<END>
gerald,was,having,an,excellent,time,but,not,his,daughter,<END>
secession,war,these,words,long,since,had,become,acutely,boring,to,scarlett,from,much,repetition,but,now,she,hated,the,sound,of,them,for,they,meant,that,the,men,would,stand,there,for,hours,haranguing,one,another,and,she,would,have,no,chance,to,corner,ashley,<END>
of,course,there,would,be,no,war,and,the,men,all,knew,it,<END>

thought,scarlett,bitterly,casting,a,surreptitious,glance,about,her,in,the,hope,of,being,rescued,from,the,conversation,<END>
would,you,<END>
oh,yes,indeed,mr,hamilton,<END>
three,rosaries,a,night,at,least,<END>
charles,gave,a,swift,look,about,him,drew,in,his,breath,stiffened,the,muscles,of,his,stomach,<END>
they,were,practically,alone,and,he,might,never,get,another,such,opportunity,<END>
and,even,given,another,such,godsent,occasion,his,courage,might,fail,him,<END>
miss,o'hara,i,must,tell,you,something,<END>
i,i,love,you,<END>
um,<END>
said,scarlett,absently,trying,to,peer,through,the,crowd,of,arguing,men,to,where,ashley,still,sat,talking,at,melanie's,feet,<END>
yes,<END>
whispered,charles,in,a,rapture,that,she,had,neither,laughed,screamed,nor,fainted,as,he,had,always,imagined,young,girls,did,under,such,circumstances,<END>
i,love,you,<END>
you,are,the,most,the,most,and,he,found,his,tongue,for,the,first,time,in,his,life,<END>
the,most,beautiful,girl,i've,ever,known,and,the,sweetest,and,the,kindest,and,you,have,the,dearest,ways,and,i,love,you,with,all,my,heart,<END>
i,cannot,hope,that,you,could,love,anyone,like,me,but,my,dear,miss,o'hara,if,you,can,give,me,any,encouragement,i,will,do,anything,in,the,world,to,make,you,love,me,<END>
i,will,<END>
charles,stopped,for,he,couldn't,think,of,anything,difficult,enough,of,accomplishment,to,really,prove,to,scarlett,the,depth,of,his,feeling,so,he,said,simply,i,want,to,marry,you,<END>
scarlett,came,back,to,earth,with,a,jerk,at,the,sound,of,the,word,marry,<END>
she,had,been,thinking,of,marriage,and,of,ashley,and,she,looked,at,charles,with,poorly,concealed,irritation,<END>
why,must,this,calf-like,fool,intrude,his,feelings,on,this,particular,day,when,she,was,so,worried,she,was,about,to,lose,her,mind,<END>
she,looked,into,the,pleading,brown,eyes,and,she,saw,none,of,the,beauty,of,a,shy,boy's,first,love,of,the,adoration,of,an,ideal,come,true,or,the,wild,happiness,and,tenderness,that,were,sweeping,through,him,like,a,flame,<END>
scarlett,was,used,to,men,asking,her,to,marry,them,men,much,more,attractive,than,charles,hamilton,and,men,who,had,more,finesse,than,to,propose,at,a,barbecue,when,she,had,more,important,matters,on,her,mind,<END>
she,only,saw,a,boy,of,twenty,red,as,a,beet,and,looking,very,silly,<END>
she,wished,that,she,could,tell,him,how,silly,he,looked,<END>
but,automatically,the,words,ellen,had,taught,her,to,say,in,such,emergencies,rose,to,her,lips,and,casting,down,her,eyes,from,force,of,long,habit,she,murmured,mr,hamilton,i,am,not,unaware,of,the,honor,you,have,bestowed,on,me,in,wanting,me,to,become,your,wife,but,this,is,all,so,sudden,that,i,do,not,know,what,to,say,<END>
that,was,a,neat,way,of,smoothing,a,man's,vanity,and,yet,keeping,him,on,the,string,and,charles,rose,to,it,as,though,such,bait,were,new,and,he,the,first,to,swallow,it,<END>
i,would,wait,forever,<END>
i,wouldn't,want,you,unless,you,were,quite,sure,<END>
please,miss,o'hara,tell,me,that,i,may,hope,<END>
um,said,scarlett,her,sharp,eyes,noting,that,ashley,who,had,not,risen,to,take,part,in,the,war,talk,was,smiling,up,at,melanie,<END>
if,this,fool,who,was,grappling,for,her,hand,would,only,keep,quiet,for,a,moment,perhaps,she,could,hear,what,they,were,saying,<END>
she,must,hear,what,they,said,<END>
what,did,melanie,say,to,him,that,brought,that,look,of,interest,to,his,eyes,<END>
charles',words,blurred,the,voices,she,strained,to,hear,<END>
oh,hush,<END>
she,hissed,at,him,pinching,his,hand,and,not,even,looking,at,him,<END>
startled,at,first,abashed,charles,blushed,at,the,rebuff,and,then,seeing,how,her,eyes,were,fastened,on,his,sister,he,smiled,<END>
scarlett,was,afraid,someone,might,hear,his,words,<END>
she,was,naturally,embarrassed,and,shy,and,in,agony,lest,they,be,overheard,<END>
charles,felt,a,surge,of,masculinity,such,as,he,had,never,experienced,for,this,was,the,first,time,in,his,life,that,he,had,ever,embarrassed,any,girl,<END>
the,thrill,was,intoxicating,<END>
he,arranged,his,face,in,what,he,fancied,was,an,expression,of,careless,unconcern,and,cautiously,returned,scarlett's,pinch,to,show,that,he,was,man,of,the,world,enough,to,understand,and,accept,her,reproof,<END>
she,did,not,even,feel,his,pinch,for,she,could,hear,clearly,the,sweet,voice,that,was,melanie's,chief,charm,i,fear,i,cannot,agree,with,you,about,mr,thackeray's,works,<END>
he,is,a,cynic,<END>
i,fear,he,is,not,the,gentleman,mr,dickens,is,<END>
what,a,silly,thing,to,say,to,a,man,thought,scarlett,ready,to,giggle,with,relief,<END>
why,she's,no,more,than,a,bluestocking,and,everyone,knows,what,men,think,of,bluestockings,<END>
the,way,to,get,a,man,interested,and,to,hold,his,interest,was,to,talk,about,him,and,then,gradually,lead,the,conversation,around,to,yourself,and,keep,it,there,<END>
scarlett,would,have,felt,some,cause,for,alarm,if,melanie,had,been,saying,how,wonderful,you,are,<END>
or,how,do,you,ever,think,of,such,things,<END>
my,little,ole,brain,would,bust,if,i,even,tried,to,think,about,them,<END>
but,here,she,was,with,a,man,at,her,feet,talking,as,seriously,as,if,she,were,in,church,<END>
the,prospect,looked,brighter,to,scarlett,so,bright,in,fact,that,she,turned,beaming,eyes,on,charles,and,smiled,from,pure,joy,<END>
enraptured,at,this,evidence,of,her,affection,he,grabbed,up,her,fan,and,plied,it,so,enthusiastically,her,hair,began,to,blow,about,untidily,<END>
ashley,you,have,not,favored,us,with,your,opinion,said,jim,tarleton,turning,from,the,group,of,shouting,men,and,with,an,apology,ashley,excused,himself,and,rose,<END>
there,was,no,one,there,so,handsome,thought,scarlett,as,she,marked,how,graceful,was,his,negligent,pose,and,how,the,sun,gleamed,on,his,gold,hair,and,mustache,<END>
even,the,older,men,stopped,to,listen,to,his,words,<END>
why,gentlemen,if,georgia,fights,i'll,go,with,her,<END>
why,else,would,i,have,joined,the,troop,<END>
he,said,<END>
his,gray,eyes,opened,wide,and,their,drowsiness,disappeared,in,an,intensity,that,scarlett,had,never,seen,before,<END>
but,like,father,i,hope,the,yankees,will,let,us,go,in,peace,and,that,there,will,be,no,fighting,he,held,up,his,hand,with,a,smile,as,a,babel,of,voices,from,the,fontaine,and,tarleton,boys,began,<END>
yes,yes,i,know,we've,been,insulted,and,lied,to,but,if,we'd,been,in,the,yankees',shoes,and,they,were,trying,to,leave,the,union,how,would,we,have,acted,<END>
pretty,much,the,same,<END>
we,wouldn't,have,liked,it,<END>
there,he,goes,again,thought,scarlett,<END>
always,putting,himself,in,the,other,fellow's,shoes,<END>
to,her,there,was,never,but,one,fair,side,to,an,argument,<END>
sometimes,there,was,no,understanding,ashley,<END>
let's,don't,be,too,hot,headed,and,let's,don't,have,any,war,<END>
most,of,the,misery,of,the,world,has,been,caused,by,wars,<END>
and,when,the,wars,were,over,no,one,ever,knew,what,they,were,all,about,<END>
scarlett,sniffed,<END>
lucky,for,ashley,that,he,had,an,unassailable,reputation,for,courage,or,else,there'd,be,trouble,<END>
as,she,thought,this,the,clamor,of,dissenting,voices,rose,up,about,ashley,indignant,fiery,<END>
under,the,arbor,the,deaf,old,gentleman,from,fayetteville,punched,india,<END>
what's,it,all,about,<END>
what,are,they,saying,<END>
war,<END>
shouted,india,cupping,her,hand,to,his,ear,<END>
they,want,to,fight,the,yankees,<END>
war,is,it,<END>
he,cried,fumbling,about,him,for,his,cane,and,heaving,himself,out,of,his,chair,with,more,energy,than,he,had,shown,in,years,<END>
i'll,tell,'um,about,war,<END>
i've,been,there,<END>
it,was,not,often,that,mr,mcrae,had,the,opportunity,to,talk,about,war,the,way,his,women,folks,shushed,him,<END>
he,stumped,rapidly,to,the,group,waving,his,cane,and,shouting,and,because,he,could,not,hear,the,voices,about,him,he,soon,had,undisputed,possession,of,the,field,<END>
you,fire-eating,young,bucks,listen,to,me,<END>
you,don't,want,to,fight,<END>
i,fought,and,i,know,<END>
went,out,in,the,seminole,war,and,was,a,big,enough,fool,to,go,to,the,mexican,war,too,<END>
you,all,don't,know,what,war,is,<END>
you,think,it's,riding,a,pretty,horse,and,having,the,girls,throw,flowers,at,you,and,coming,home,a,hero,<END>
well,it,ain't,<END>
no,sir,<END>
it's,going,hungry,and,getting,the,measles,and,pneumonia,from,sleeping,in,the,wet,<END>
and,if,it,ain't,measles,and,pneumonia,it's,your,bowels,<END>
yes,sir,what,war,does,to,a,man's,bowels,dysentery,and,things,like,that,<END>
the,ladies,were,pink,with,blushes,<END>
mr,mcrae,was,a,reminder,of,a,cruder,era,like,grandma,fontaine,and,her,embarrassingly,loud,belches,an,era,everyone,would,like,to,forget,<END>
run,get,your,grandpa,hissed,one,of,the,old,gentleman's,daughters,to,a,young,girl,standing,near,by,<END>
i,declare,she,whispered,to,the,fluttering,matrons,about,her,he,gets,worse,every,day,<END>
would,you,believe,it,this,very,morning,he,said,to,mary,and,she's,only,sixteen,'now,missy,<END>
',<END>
and,the,voice,went,off,into,a,whisper,as,the,granddaughter,slipped,out,to,try,to,induce,mr,mcrae,to,return,to,his,seat,in,the,shade,<END>
of,all,the,group,that,milled,about,under,the,trees,girls,smiling,excitedly,men,talking,impassionedly,there,was,only,one,who,seemed,calm,<END>
scarlett's,eyes,turned,to,rhett,butler,who,leaned,against,a,tree,his,hands,shoved,deep,in,his,trouser,pockets,<END>
he,stood,alone,since,mr,wilkes,had,left,his,side,and,had,uttered,no,word,as,the,conversation,grew,hotter,<END>
the,red,lips,under,the,close-clipped,black,mustache,curled,down,and,there,was,a,glint,of,amused,contempt,in,his,black,eyes,contempt,as,if,he,listened,to,the,braggings,of,children,<END>
a,very,disagreeable,smile,scarlett,thought,<END>
he,listened,quietly,until,stuart,tarleton,his,red,hair,tousled,and,his,eyes,gleaming,repeated,why,we,could,lick,them,in,a,month,<END>
gentlemen,always,fight,better,than,rabble,<END>
a,month,why,one,battle,<END>
gentlemen,said,rhett,butler,in,a,flat,drawl,that,bespoke,his,charleston,birth,not,moving,from,his,position,against,the,tree,or,taking,his,hands,from,his,pockets,may,i,say,a,word,<END>
there,was,contempt,in,his,manner,as,in,his,eyes,contempt,overlaid,with,an,air,of,courtesy,that,somehow,burlesqued,their,own,manners,<END>
the,group,turned,toward,him,and,accorded,him,the,politeness,always,due,an,outsider,<END>
has,any,one,of,you,gentlemen,ever,thought,that,there's,not,a,cannon,factory,south,of,the,mason-dixon,line,<END>
or,how,few,iron,foundries,there,are,in,the,south,<END>
or,woolen,mills,or,cotton,factories,or,tanneries,<END>
have,you,thought,that,we,would,not,have,a,single,warship,and,that,the,yankee,fleet,could,bottle,up,our,harbors,in,a,week,so,that,we,could,not,sell,our,cotton,abroad,<END>
but,of,course,you,gentlemen,have,thought,of,these,things,<END>
why,he,means,the,boys,are,a,passel,of,fools,<END>
thought,scarlett,indignantly,the,hot,blood,coming,to,her,cheeks,<END>
evidently,she,was,not,the,only,one,to,whom,this,idea,occurred,for,several,of,the,boys,were,beginning,to,stick,out,their,chins,<END>
john,wilkes,casually,but,swiftly,came,back,to,his,place,beside,the,speaker,as,if,to,impress,on,all,present,that,this,man,was,his,guest,and,that,moreover,there,were,ladies,present,<END>
the,trouble,with,most,of,us,southerners,continued,rhett,butler,is,that,we,either,don't,travel,enough,or,we,don't,profit,enough,by,our,travels,<END>
now,of,course,all,you,gentlemen,are,well,traveled,<END>
but,what,have,you,seen,<END>
europe,and,new,york,and,philadelphia,and,of,course,the,ladies,have,been,to,saratoga,he,bowed,slightly,to,the,group,under,the,arbor,<END>
you've,seen,the,hotels,and,the,museums,and,the,balls,and,the,gambling,houses,<END>
and,you've,come,home,believing,that,there's,no,place,like,the,south,<END>
as,for,me,i,was,charleston,born,but,i,have,spent,the,last,few,years,in,the,north,<END>
his,white,teeth,showed,in,a,grin,as,though,he,realized,that,everyone,present,knew,just,why,he,no,longer,lived,in,charleston,and,cared,not,at,all,if,they,did,know,<END>
i,have,seen,many,things,that,you,all,have,not,seen,<END>
the,thousands,of,immigrants,who'd,be,glad,to,fight,for,the,yankees,for,food,and,a,few,dollars,the,factories,the,foundries,the,shipyards,the,iron,and,coal,mines,all,the,things,we,haven't,got,<END>
why,all,we,have,is,cotton,and,slaves,and,arrogance,<END>
they'd,lick,us,in,a,month,<END>
for,a,tense,moment,there,was,silence,<END>
rhett,butler,removed,a,fine,linen,handkerchief,from,his,coat,pocket,and,idly,flicked,dust,from,his,sleeve,<END>
then,an,ominous,murmuring,arose,in,the,crowd,and,from,under,the,arbor,came,a,humming,as,unmistakable,as,that,of,a,hive,of,newly,disturbed,bees,<END>
even,while,she,felt,the,hot,blood,of,wrath,still,in,her,cheeks,something,in,scarlett's,practical,mind,prompted,the,thought,that,what,this,man,said,was,right,and,it,sounded,like,common,sense,<END>
why,she'd,never,even,seen,a,factory,or,known,anyone,who,had,seen,a,factory,<END>
but,even,if,it,were,true,he,was,no,gentleman,to,make,such,a,statement,and,at,a,party,too,where,everyone,was,having,a,good,time,<END>
stuart,tarleton,brows,lowering,came,forward,with,brent,close,at,his,heels,<END>
of,course,the,tarleton,twins,had,nice,manners,and,they,wouldn't,make,a,scene,at,a,barbecue,even,though,tremendously,provoked,<END>
just,the,same,all,the,ladies,felt,pleasantly,excited,for,it,was,so,seldom,that,they,actually,saw,a,scene,or,a,quarrel,<END>
usually,they,had,to,hear,of,it,third-hand,<END>
sir,said,stuart,heavily,what,do,you,mean,<END>
rhett,looked,at,him,with,polite,but,mocking,eyes,<END>
i,mean,he,answered,what,napoleon,perhaps,you've,heard,of,him,remarked,once,'god,is,on,the,side,of,the,strongest,battalion,',<END>
and,turning,to,john,wilkes,he,said,with,courtesy,that,was,unfeigned,you,promised,to,show,me,your,library,sir,<END>
would,it,be,too,great,a,favor,to,ask,to,see,it,now,<END>
i,fear,i,must,go,back,to,jonesboro,early,this,afternoon,where,a,bit,of,business,calls,me,<END>
he,swung,about,facing,the,crowd,clicked,his,heels,together,and,bowed,like,a,dancing,master,a,bow,that,was,graceful,for,so,powerful,a,man,and,as,full,of,impertinence,as,a,slap,in,the,face,<END>
then,he,walked,across,the,lawn,with,john,wilkes,his,black,head,in,the,air,and,the,sound,of,his,discomforting,laughter,floated,back,to,the,group,about,the,tables,<END>
there,was,a,startled,silence,and,then,the,buzzing,broke,out,again,<END>
india,rose,tiredly,from,her,seat,beneath,the,arbor,and,went,toward,the,angry,stuart,tarleton,<END>
scarlett,could,not,hear,what,she,said,but,the,look,in,her,eyes,as,she,gazed,up,into,his,lowering,face,gave,scarlett,something,like,a,twinge,of,conscience,<END>
it,was,the,same,look,of,belonging,that,melanie,wore,when,she,looked,at,ashley,only,stuart,did,not,see,it,<END>
so,india,did,love,him,<END>
scarlett,thought,for,an,instant,that,if,she,had,not,flirted,so,blatantly,with,stuart,at,that,political,speaking,a,year,ago,he,might,have,married,india,long,ere,this,<END>
but,then,the,twinge,passed,with,the,comforting,thought,that,it,wasn't,her,fault,if,other,girls,couldn't,keep,their,men,<END>
finally,stuart,smiled,down,at,india,an,unwilling,smile,and,nodded,his,head,<END>
probably,india,had,been,pleading,with,him,not,to,follow,mr,butler,and,make,trouble,<END>
a,polite,tumult,broke,out,under,the,trees,as,the,guests,arose,shaking,crumbs,from,laps,<END>
the,married,women,called,to,nurses,and,small,children,and,gathered,their,broods,together,to,take,their,departure,and,groups,of,girls,started,off,laughing,and,talking,toward,the,house,to,exchange,gossip,in,the,upstairs,bedrooms,and,to,take,their,naps,<END>
all,the,ladies,except,mrs,tarleton,moved,out,of,the,back,yard,leaving,the,shade,of,oaks,and,arbor,to,the,men,<END>
she,was,detained,by,gerald,mr,calvert,and,the,others,who,wanted,an,answer,from,her,about,the,horses,for,the,troop,<END>
ashley,strolled,over,to,where,scarlett,and,charles,sat,a,thoughtful,and,amused,smile,on,his,face,<END>
arrogant,devil,isn't,he,<END>
he,observed,looking,after,butler,<END>
he,looks,like,one,of,the,borgias,<END>
scarlett,thought,quickly,but,could,remember,no,family,in,the,county,or,atlanta,or,savannah,by,that,name,<END>
i,don't,know,them,<END>
is,he,kin,to,them,<END>
who,are,they,<END>
an,odd,look,came,over,charles',face,incredulity,and,shame,struggling,with,love,<END>
love,triumphed,as,he,realized,that,it,was,enough,for,a,girl,to,be,sweet,and,gentle,and,beautiful,without,having,an,education,to,hamper,her,charms,and,he,made,swift,answer,the,borgias,were,italians,<END>
oh,said,scarlett,losing,interest,foreigners,<END>
she,turned,her,prettiest,smile,on,ashley,but,for,some,reason,he,was,not,looking,at,her,<END>
he,was,looking,at,charles,and,there,was,understanding,in,his,face,and,a,little,pity,<END>
scarlett,stood,on,the,landing,and,peered,cautiously,over,the,banisters,into,the,hall,below,<END>
it,was,empty,<END>
from,the,bedrooms,on,the,floor,above,came,an,unending,hum,of,low,voices,rising,and,falling,punctuated,with,squeaks,of,laughter,and,now,you,didn't,really,<END>
and,what,did,he,say,then,<END>
on,the,beds,and,couches,of,the,six,great,bedrooms,the,girls,were,resting,their,dresses,off,their,stays,loosed,their,hair,flowing,down,their,backs,<END>
afternoon,naps,were,a,custom,of,the,country,and,never,were,they,so,necessary,as,on,the,all-day,parties,beginning,early,in,the,morning,and,culminating,in,a,ball,<END>
for,half,an,hour,the,girls,would,chatter,and,laugh,and,then,servants,would,pull,the,shutters,and,in,the,warm,half-gloom,the,talk,would,die,to,whispers,and,finally,expire,in,silence,broken,only,by,soft,regular,breathing,<END>
scarlett,had,made,certain,that,melanie,was,lying,down,on,the,bed,with,honey,and,hetty,tarleton,before,she,slipped,into,the,hall,and,started,down,the,stairs,<END>
from,the,window,on,the,landing,she,could,see,the,group,of,men,sitting,under,the,arbor,drinking,from,tall,glasses,and,she,knew,they,would,remain,there,until,late,afternoon,<END>
her,eyes,searched,the,group,but,ashley,was,not,among,them,<END>
then,she,listened,and,she,heard,his,voice,<END>
as,she,had,hoped,he,was,still,in,the,front,driveway,bidding,good-by,to,departing,matrons,and,children,<END>
her,heart,in,her,throat,she,went,swiftly,down,the,stairs,<END>
what,if,she,should,meet,mr,wilkes,<END>
what,excuse,could,she,give,for,prowling,about,the,house,when,all,the,other,girls,were,getting,their,beauty,naps,<END>
well,that,had,to,be,risked,<END>
as,she,reached,the,bottom,step,she,heard,the,servants,moving,about,in,the,dining,room,under,the,butler's,orders,lifting,out,the,table,and,chairs,in,preparation,for,the,dancing,<END>
across,the,wide,hall,was,the,open,door,of,the,library,and,she,sped,into,it,noiselessly,<END>
she,could,wait,there,until,ashley,finished,his,adieux,and,then,call,to,him,when,he,came,into,the,house,<END>
the,library,was,in,semidarkness,for,the,blinds,had,been,drawn,against,the,sun,<END>
the,dim,room,with,towering,walls,completely,filled,with,dark,books,depressed,her,<END>

far,across,the,long,room,before,the,hearth,the,seven-foot,sofa,ashley's,favorite,seat,reared,its,high,back,like,some,huge,sleeping,animal,<END>
she,closed,the,door,except,for,a,crack,and,tried,to,make,her,heart,beat,more,slowly,<END>
she,tried,to,remember,just,exactly,what,she,had,planned,last,night,to,say,to,ashley,but,she,couldn't,recall,anything,<END>
had,she,thought,up,something,and,forgotten,it,or,had,she,only,planned,that,ashley,should,say,something,to,her,<END>
she,couldn't,remember,and,a,sudden,cold,fright,fell,upon,her,<END>
if,her,heart,would,only,stop,pounding,in,her,ears,perhaps,she,could,think,of,what,to,say,<END>
but,the,quick,thudding,only,increased,as,she,heard,him,call,a,final,farewell,and,walk,into,the,front,hall,<END>
all,she,could,think,of,was,that,she,loved,him,everything,about,him,from,the,proud,lift,of,his,gold,head,to,his,slender,dark,boots,loved,his,laughter,even,when,it,mystified,her,loved,his,bewildering,silences,<END>
oh,if,only,he,would,walk,in,on,her,now,and,take,her,in,his,arms,so,she,would,be,spared,the,need,of,saying,anything,<END>
he,must,love,her,perhaps,if,i,prayed,she,squeezed,her,eyes,tightly,and,began,gabbling,to,herself,hail,mary,full,of,grace,<END>
why,scarlett,<END>
said,ashley's,voice,breaking,in,through,the,roaring,in,her,ears,and,throwing,her,into,utter,confusion,<END>
he,stood,in,the,hall,peering,at,her,through,the,partly,opened,door,a,quizzical,smile,on,his,face,<END>
who,are,you,hiding,from,charles,or,the,tarletons,<END>
she,gulped,<END>
so,he,had,noticed,how,the,men,had,swarmed,about,her,<END>
how,unutterably,dear,he,was,standing,there,with,his,eyes,twinkling,all,unaware,of,her,excitement,<END>
she,could,not,speak,but,she,put,out,a,hand,and,drew,him,into,the,room,<END>
he,entered,puzzled,but,interested,<END>
there,was,a,tenseness,about,her,a,glow,in,her,eyes,that,he,had,never,seen,before,and,even,in,the,dim,light,he,could,see,the,rosy,flush,on,her,cheeks,<END>
automatically,he,closed,the,door,behind,him,and,took,her,hand,<END>
what,is,it,<END>
he,said,almost,in,a,whisper,<END>
at,the,touch,of,his,hand,she,began,to,tremble,<END>
it,was,going,to,happen,now,just,as,she,had,dreamed,it,<END>
a,thousand,incoherent,thoughts,shot,through,her,mind,and,she,could,not,catch,a,single,one,to,mold,into,a,word,<END>
she,could,only,shake,and,look,up,into,his,face,<END>
why,didn't,he,speak,<END>
what,is,it,<END>
he,repeated,<END>
a,secret,to,tell,me,<END>
suddenly,she,found,her,tongue,and,just,as,suddenly,all,the,years,of,ellen's,teachings,fell,away,and,the,forthright,irish,blood,of,gerald,spoke,from,his,daughter's,lips,<END>
yes,a,secret,<END>
i,love,you,<END>
for,an,instance,there,was,a,silence,so,acute,it,seemed,that,neither,of,them,even,breathed,<END>
then,the,trembling,fell,away,from,her,as,happiness,and,pride,surged,through,her,<END>
why,hadn't,she,done,this,before,<END>
how,much,simpler,than,all,the,ladylike,maneuverings,she,had,been,taught,<END>
and,then,her,eyes,sought,his,<END>
there,was,a,look,of,consternation,in,them,of,incredulity,and,something,more,what,was,it,<END>
yes,gerald,had,looked,that,way,the,day,his,pet,hunter,had,broken,his,leg,and,he,had,had,to,shoot,him,<END>
why,did,she,have,to,think,of,that,now,<END>
such,a,silly,thought,<END>
and,why,did,ashley,look,so,oddly,and,say,nothing,<END>
then,something,like,a,well-trained,mask,came,down,over,his,face,and,he,smiled,gallantly,<END>
isn't,it,enough,that,you've,collected,every,other,man's,heart,here,today,<END>
he,said,with,the,old,teasing,caressing,note,in,his,voice,<END>
do,you,want,to,make,it,unanimous,<END>
well,you've,always,had,my,heart,you,know,<END>
you,cut,your,teeth,on,it,<END>
something,was,wrong,all,wrong,<END>
this,was,not,the,way,she,had,planned,it,<END>
through,the,mad,tearing,of,ideas,round,and,round,in,her,brain,one,was,beginning,to,take,form,<END>
somehow,for,some,reason,ashley,was,acting,as,if,he,thought,she,was,just,flirting,with,him,<END>
but,he,knew,differently,<END>
she,knew,he,did,<END>
ashley,ashley,tell,me,you,must,oh,don't,tease,me,now,<END>
have,i,your,heart,<END>
oh,my,dear,i,lo,<END>
his,hand,went,across,her,lips,swiftly,<END>
the,mask,was,gone,<END>
you,must,not,say,these,things,scarlett,<END>
you,mustn't,<END>
you,don't,mean,them,<END>
you'll,hate,yourself,for,saying,them,and,you'll,hate,me,for,hearing,them,<END>
she,jerked,her,head,away,<END>
a,hot,swift,current,was,running,through,her,<END>
i,couldn't,ever,hate,you,<END>
i,tell,you,i,love,you,and,i,know,you,must,care,about,me,because,she,stopped,<END>
never,before,had,she,seen,so,much,misery,in,anyone's,face,<END>
ashley,do,you,care,you,do,don't,you,<END>
yes,he,said,dully,<END>
i,care,<END>
if,he,had,said,he,loathed,her,she,could,not,have,been,more,frightened,<END>
she,plucked,at,his,sleeve,speechless,<END>
scarlett,he,said,can't,we,go,away,and,forget,that,we,have,ever,said,these,things,<END>
no,she,whispered,<END>
i,can't,<END>
what,do,you,mean,<END>
don't,you,want,to,to,marry,me,<END>
he,replied,i'm,going,to,marry,melanie,<END>
somehow,she,found,that,she,was,sitting,on,the,low,velvet,chair,and,ashley,on,the,hassock,at,her,feet,was,holding,both,her,hands,in,his,in,a,hard,grip,<END>
he,was,saying,things,things,that,made,no,sense,<END>
her,mind,was,quite,blank,quite,empty,of,all,the,thoughts,that,had,surged,through,it,only,a,moment,before,and,his,words,made,no,more,impression,than,rain,on,glass,<END>
they,fell,on,unhearing,ears,words,that,were,swift,and,tender,and,full,of,pity,like,a,father,speaking,to,a,hurt,child,<END>
the,sound,of,melanie's,name,caught,in,her,consciousness,and,she,looked,into,his,crystal-gray,eyes,<END>
she,saw,in,them,the,old,remoteness,that,had,always,baffled,her,and,a,look,of,self-hatred,<END>
father,is,to,announce,the,engagement,tonight,<END>
we,are,to,be,married,soon,<END>
i,should,have,told,you,but,i,thought,you,knew,<END>
i,thought,everyone,knew,had,known,for,years,<END>
i,never,dreamed,that,you,you've,so,many,beaux,<END>
i,thought,stuart,<END>
life,and,feeling,and,comprehension,were,beginning,to,flow,back,into,her,<END>
but,you,just,said,you,cared,for,me,<END>
his,warm,hands,hurt,hers,<END>
my,dear,must,you,make,me,say,things,that,will,hurt,you,<END>
her,silence,pressed,him,on,<END>
how,can,i,make,you,see,these,things,my,dear,<END>
you,who,are,so,young,and,unthinking,that,you,do,not,know,what,marriage,means,<END>
i,know,i,love,you,<END>
love,isn't,enough,to,make,a,successful,marriage,when,two,people,are,as,different,as,we,are,<END>
you,would,want,all,of,a,man,scarlett,his,body,his,heart,his,soul,his,thoughts,<END>
and,if,you,did,not,have,them,you,would,be,miserable,<END>
and,i,couldn't,give,you,all,of,me,<END>
i,couldn't,give,all,of,me,to,anyone,<END>
and,i,would,not,want,all,of,your,mind,and,your,soul,<END>
and,you,would,be,hurt,and,then,you,would,come,to,hate,me,how,bitterly,<END>
you,would,hate,the,books,i,read,and,the,music,i,loved,because,they,took,me,away,from,you,even,for,a,moment,<END>
and,i,perhaps,i,<END>
do,you,love,her,<END>
she,is,like,me,part,of,my,blood,and,we,understand,each,other,<END>
scarlett,<END>
scarlett,<END>
can't,i,make,you,see,that,a,marriage,can't,go,on,in,any,sort,of,peace,unless,the,two,people,are,alike,<END>
some,one,else,had,said,that,like,must,marry,like,or,there'll,be,no,happiness,<END>
who,was,it,<END>
it,seemed,a,million,years,since,she,had,heard,that,but,it,still,did,not,make,sense,<END>
but,you,said,you,cared,<END>
i,shouldn't,have,said,it,<END>
somewhere,in,her,brain,a,slow,fire,rose,and,rage,began,to,blot,out,everything,else,<END>
well,having,been,cad,enough,to,say,it,<END>
his,face,went,white,<END>
i,was,a,cad,to,say,it,as,i'm,going,to,marry,melanie,<END>
i,did,you,a,wrong,and,melanie,a,greater,one,<END>
i,should,not,have,said,it,for,i,knew,you,wouldn't,understand,<END>
how,could,i,help,caring,for,you,you,who,have,all,the,passion,for,life,that,i,have,not,<END>
you,who,can,love,and,hate,with,a,violence,impossible,to,me,<END>
why,you,are,as,elemental,as,fire,and,wind,and,wild,things,and,i,<END>
she,thought,of,melanie,and,saw,suddenly,her,quiet,brown,eyes,with,their,far-off,look,her,placid,little,hands,in,their,black,lace,mitts,her,gentle,silences,<END>
and,then,her,rage,broke,the,same,rage,that,drove,gerald,to,murder,and,other,irish,ancestors,to,misdeeds,that,cost,them,their,necks,<END>
there,was,nothing,in,her,now,of,the,well-bred,robillards,who,could,bear,with,white,silence,anything,the,world,might,cast,<END>
why,don't,you,say,it,you,coward,<END>
you're,afraid,to,marry,me,<END>
you'd,rather,live,with,that,stupid,little,fool,who,can't,open,her,mouth,except,to,say,'yes',or,'no',and,raise,a,passel,of,mealy-,mouthed,brats,just,like,her,<END>
why,<END>
you,must,not,say,these,things,about,melanie,<END>
'i,mustn't',be,damned,to,you,<END>
who,are,you,to,tell,me,i,mustn't,<END>
you,coward,you,cad,you,you,made,me,believe,you,were,going,to,marry,me,<END>
be,fair,his,voice,pleaded,<END>
did,i,ever,<END>
she,did,not,want,to,be,fair,although,she,knew,what,he,said,was,true,<END>
he,had,never,once,crossed,the,borders,of,friendliness,with,her,and,when,she,thought,of,this,fresh,anger,rose,the,anger,of,hurt,pride,and,feminine,vanity,<END>
she,had,run,after,him,and,he,would,have,none,of,her,<END>
he,preferred,a,whey-faced,little,fool,like,melanie,to,her,<END>
oh,far,better,that,she,had,followed,ellen,and,mammy's,precepts,and,never,never,revealed,that,she,even,liked,him,better,anything,than,to,be,faced,with,this,scorching,shame,<END>
she,sprang,to,her,feet,her,hands,clenched,and,he,rose,towering,over,her,his,face,full,of,the,mute,misery,of,one,forced,to,face,realities,when,realities,are,agonies,<END>
i,shall,hate,you,till,i,die,you,cad,you,lowdown,lowdown,what,was,the,word,she,wanted,<END>
she,could,not,think,of,any,word,bad,enough,<END>
scarlett,please,<END>
he,put,out,his,hand,toward,her,and,as,he,did,she,slapped,him,across,the,face,with,all,the,strength,she,had,<END>
the,noise,cracked,like,a,whip,in,the,still,room,and,suddenly,her,rage,was,gone,and,there,was,desolation,in,her,heart,<END>
the,red,mark,of,her,hand,showed,plainly,on,his,white,tired,face,<END>
he,said,nothing,but,lifted,her,limp,hand,to,his,lips,and,kissed,it,<END>
then,he,was,gone,before,she,could,speak,again,closing,the,door,softly,behind,him,<END>
she,sat,down,again,very,suddenly,the,reaction,from,her,rage,making,her,knees,feel,weak,<END>
he,was,gone,and,the,memory,of,his,stricken,face,would,haunt,her,till,she,died,<END>
she,heard,the,soft,muffled,sound,of,his,footsteps,dying,away,down,the,long,hall,and,the,complete,enormity,of,her,actions,came,over,her,<END>
she,had,lost,him,forever,<END>
now,he,would,hate,her,and,every,time,he,looked,at,her,he,would,remember,how,she,threw,herself,at,him,when,he,had,given,her,no,encouragement,at,all,<END>
i'm,as,bad,as,honey,wilkes,she,thought,suddenly,and,remembered,how,everyone,and,she,more,than,anyone,else,had,laughed,contemptuously,at,honey's,forward,conduct,<END>
she,saw,honey's,awkward,wigglings,and,heard,her,silly,titters,as,she,hung,onto,boys',arms,and,the,thought,stung,her,to,new,rage,rage,at,herself,at,ashley,at,the,world,<END>
because,she,hated,herself,she,hated,them,all,with,the,fury,of,the,thwarted,and,humiliated,love,of,sixteen,<END>
only,a,little,true,tenderness,had,been,mixed,into,her,love,<END>
mostly,it,had,been,compounded,out,of,vanity,and,complacent,confidence,in,her,own,charms,<END>
now,she,had,lost,and,greater,than,her,sense,of,loss,was,the,fear,that,she,had,made,a,public,spectacle,of,herself,<END>
had,she,been,as,obvious,as,honey,<END>
was,everyone,laughing,at,her,<END>
she,began,to,shake,at,the,thought,<END>
her,hand,dropped,to,a,little,table,beside,her,fingering,a,tiny,china,rose-bowl,on,which,two,china,cherubs,smirked,<END>
the,room,was,so,still,she,almost,screamed,to,break,the,silence,<END>
she,must,do,something,or,go,mad,<END>
she,picked,up,the,bowl,and,hurled,it,viciously,across,the,room,toward,the,fireplace,<END>
it,barely,cleared,the,tall,back,of,the,sofa,and,splintered,with,a,little,crash,against,the,marble,mantelpiece,<END>
this,said,a,voice,from,the,depths,of,the,sofa,is,too,much,<END>
nothing,had,ever,startled,or,frightened,her,so,much,and,her,mouth,went,too,dry,for,her,to,utter,a,sound,<END>
she,caught,hold,of,the,back,of,the,chair,her,knees,going,weak,under,her,as,rhett,butler,rose,from,the,sofa,where,he,had,been,lying,and,made,her,a,bow,of,exaggerated,politeness,<END>
it,is,bad,enough,to,have,an,afternoon,nap,disturbed,by,such,a,passage,as,i've,been,forced,to,hear,but,why,should,my,life,be,endangered,<END>
he,was,real,<END>
he,wasn't,a,ghost,<END>
but,saints,preserve,us,he,had,heard,everything,<END>
she,rallied,her,forces,into,a,semblance,of,dignity,<END>
sir,you,should,have,made,known,your,presence,<END>
indeed,<END>
his,white,teeth,gleamed,and,his,bold,dark,eyes,laughed,at,her,<END>
but,you,were,the,intruder,<END>
i,was,forced,to,wait,for,mr,kennedy,and,feeling,that,i,was,perhaps,persona,non,grata,in,the,back,yard,i,was,thoughtful,enough,to,remove,my,unwelcome,presence,here,where,i,thought,i,would,be,undisturbed,<END>
but,alas,<END>
he,shrugged,and,laughed,softly,<END>
her,temper,was,beginning,to,rise,again,at,the,thought,that,this,rude,and,impertinent,man,had,heard,everything,heard,things,she,now,wished,she,had,died,before,she,ever,uttered,<END>
eavesdroppers,she,began,furiously,<END>
eavesdroppers,often,hear,highly,entertaining,and,instructive,things,he,grinned,<END>
from,a,long,experience,in,eavesdropping,i,<END>
sir,she,said,you,are,no,gentleman,<END>
an,apt,observation,he,answered,airily,<END>
and,you,miss,are,no,lady,<END>
he,seemed,to,find,her,very,amusing,for,he,laughed,softly,again,<END>
no,one,can,remain,a,lady,after,saying,and,doing,what,i,have,just,overheard,<END>
however,ladies,have,seldom,held,any,charms,for,me,<END>
i,know,what,they,are,thinking,but,they,never,have,the,courage,or,lack,of,breeding,to,say,what,they,think,<END>
and,that,in,time,becomes,a,bore,<END>
but,you,my,dear,miss,o'hara,are,a,girl,of,rare,spirit,very,admirable,spirit,and,i,take,off,my,hat,to,you,<END>
i,fail,to,understand,what,charms,the,elegant,mr,wilkes,can,hold,for,a,girl,of,your,tempestuous,nature,<END>
he,should,thank,god,on,bended,knee,for,a,girl,with,your,how,did,he,put,it,'passion,for,living,',but,being,a,poor-spirited,wretch,<END>
you,aren't,fit,to,wipe,his,boots,<END>
she,shouted,in,rage,<END>
and,you,were,going,to,hate,him,all,your,life,<END>
he,sank,down,on,the,sofa,and,she,heard,him,laughing,<END>
if,she,could,have,killed,him,she,would,have,done,it,<END>
instead,she,walked,out,of,the,room,with,such,dignity,as,she,could,summon,and,banged,the,heavy,door,behind,her,<END>
she,went,up,the,stairs,so,swiftly,that,when,she,reached,the,landing,she,thought,she,was,going,to,faint,<END>
she,stopped,clutching,the,banisters,her,heart,hammering,so,hard,from,anger,insult,and,exertion,that,it,seemed,about,to,burst,through,her,basque,<END>
she,tried,to,draw,deep,breaths,but,mammy's,lacings,were,too,tight,<END>
if,she,should,faint,and,they,should,find,her,here,on,the,landing,what,would,they,think,<END>
oh,they'd,think,everything,<END>
ashley,and,that,vile,butler,man,and,those,nasty,girls,who,were,so,jealous,<END>
for,once,in,her,life,she,wished,that,she,carried,smelling,salts,like,the,other,girls,but,she,had,never,even,owned,a,vinaigrette,<END>
she,had,always,been,so,proud,of,never,feeling,giddy,<END>
she,simply,could,not,let,herself,faint,now,<END>
gradually,the,sickening,feeling,began,to,depart,<END>
in,a,minute,she'd,feel,all,right,and,then,she'd,slip,quietly,into,the,little,dressing,room,adjoining,india's,room,unloose,her,stays,and,creep,in,and,lay,herself,on,one,of,the,beds,beside,the,sleeping,girls,<END>
she,tried,to,quiet,her,heart,and,fix,her,face,into,more,composed,lines,for,she,knew,she,must,look,like,a,crazy,woman,<END>
if,any,of,the,girls,were,awake,they'd,know,something,was,wrong,<END>
and,no,one,must,ever,ever,know,that,anything,had,happened,<END>
through,the,wide,bay,window,on,the,lawn,she,could,see,the,men,still,lounging,in,their,chairs,under,the,trees,and,in,the,shade,of,the,arbor,<END>
how,she,envied,them,<END>
how,wonderful,to,be,a,man,and,never,have,to,undergo,miseries,such,as,she,had,just,passed,through,<END>
as,she,stood,watching,them,hot,eyed,and,dizzy,she,heard,the,rapid,pounding,of,a,horse's,hooves,on,the,front,drive,the,scattering,of,gravel,and,the,sound,of,an,excited,voice,calling,a,question,to,one,of,the,negroes,<END>
the,gravel,flew,again,and,across,her,vision,a,man,on,horseback,galloped,over,the,green,lawn,toward,the,lazy,group,under,the,trees,<END>
some,late-come,guest,but,why,did,he,ride,his,horse,across,the,turf,that,was,india's,pride,<END>
she,could,not,recognize,him,but,as,he,flung,himself,from,the,saddle,and,clutched,john,wilkes',arm,she,could,see,that,there,was,excitement,in,every,line,of,him,<END>
the,crowd,swarmed,about,him,tall,glasses,and,palmetto,fans,abandoned,on,tables,and,on,the,ground,<END>
in,spite,of,the,distance,she,could,hear,the,hubbub,of,voices,questioning,calling,feel,the,fever-,pitch,tenseness,of,the,men,<END>
then,above,the,confused,sounds,stuart,tarleton's,voice,rose,in,an,exultant,shout,yee-aay-ee,<END>
as,if,he,were,on,the,hunting,field,<END>
and,she,heard,for,the,first,time,without,knowing,it,the,rebel,yell,<END>
as,she,watched,the,four,tarletons,followed,by,the,fontaine,boys,broke,from,the,group,and,began,hurrying,toward,the,stable,yelling,as,they,ran,jeems,<END>
you,jeems,<END>

somebody's,house,must,have,caught,fire,scarlett,thought,<END>
but,fire,or,no,fire,her,job,was,to,get,herself,back,into,the,bedroom,before,she,was,discovered,<END>
her,heart,was,quieter,now,and,she,tiptoed,up,the,steps,into,the,silent,hall,<END>
a,heavy,warm,somnolence,lay,over,the,house,as,if,it,slept,at,ease,like,the,girls,until,night,when,it,would,burst,into,its,full,beauty,with,music,and,candle,flames,<END>
carefully,she,eased,open,the,door,of,the,dressing,room,and,slipped,in,<END>
her,hand,was,behind,her,still,holding,the,knob,when,honey,wilkes',voice,low,pitched,almost,in,a,whisper,came,to,her,through,the,crack,of,the,opposite,door,leading,into,the,bedroom,<END>

scarlett,felt,her,heart,begin,its,mad,racing,again,and,she,clutched,her,hand,against,it,unconsciously,as,if,she,would,squeeze,it,into,submission,<END>

but,the,next,voice,made,her,pause,<END>
a,team,of,mules,could,not,have,dragged,her,away,when,she,heard,melanie's,voice,<END>
oh,honey,no,<END>
don't,be,unkind,<END>
she's,just,high,spirited,and,vivacious,<END>
i,thought,her,most,charming,<END>
oh,thought,scarlett,clawing,her,nails,into,her,basque,<END>
to,have,that,mealymouthed,little,mess,take,up,for,me,<END>
it,was,harder,to,bear,than,honey's,out-and-out,cattiness,<END>
scarlett,had,never,trusted,any,woman,and,had,never,credited,any,woman,except,her,mother,with,motives,other,than,selfish,ones,<END>
melanie,knew,she,had,ashley,securely,so,she,could,well,afford,to,show,such,a,christian,spirit,<END>
scarlett,felt,it,was,just,melanie's,way,of,parading,her,conquest,and,getting,credit,for,being,sweet,at,the,same,time,<END>
scarlett,had,frequently,used,the,same,trick,herself,when,discussing,other,girls,with,men,and,it,had,never,failed,to,convince,foolish,males,of,her,sweetness,and,unselfishness,<END>
well,miss,said,honey,tartly,her,voice,rising,you,must,be,blind,<END>
hush,honey,hissed,the,voice,of,sally,munroe,<END>
they'll,hear,you,all,over,the,house,<END>
honey,lowered,her,voice,but,went,on,<END>
well,you,saw,how,she,was,carrying,on,with,every,man,she,could,get,hold,of,even,mr,kennedy,and,he's,her,own,sister's,beau,<END>
i,never,saw,the,like,<END>
and,she,certainly,was,going,after,charles,<END>
honey,giggled,self-consciously,<END>
and,you,know,charles,and,i,<END>
are,you,really,<END>
whispered,voices,excitedly,<END>
well,don't,tell,anybody,girls,not,yet,<END>
there,were,more,gigglings,and,the,bed,springs,creaked,as,someone,squeezed,honey,<END>
melanie,murmured,something,about,how,happy,she,was,that,honey,would,be,her,sister,<END>
well,i,won't,be,happy,to,have,scarlett,for,my,sister,because,she's,a,fast,piece,if,ever,i,saw,one,came,the,aggrieved,voice,of,hefty,tarleton,<END>
but,she's,as,good,as,engaged,to,stuart,<END>
brent,says,she,doesn't,give,a,rap,about,him,but,of,course,brent's,crazy,about,her,too,<END>
if,you,should,ask,me,said,honey,with,mysterious,importance,there's,only,one,person,she,does,give,a,rap,about,<END>
and,that's,ashley,<END>
as,the,whisperings,merged,together,violently,questioning,interrupting,scarlett,felt,herself,go,cold,with,fear,and,humiliation,<END>
honey,was,a,fool,a,silly,a,simpleton,about,men,but,she,had,a,feminine,instinct,about,other,women,that,scarlett,had,underestimated,<END>
the,mortification,and,hurt,pride,that,she,had,suffered,in,the,library,with,ashley,and,with,rhett,butler,were,pin,pricks,to,this,<END>
men,could,be,trusted,to,keep,their,mouths,shut,even,men,like,mr,butler,but,with,honey,wilkes,giving,tongue,like,a,hound,in,the,field,the,entire,county,would,know,about,it,before,six,o'clock,<END>
and,gerald,had,said,only,last,night,that,he,wouldn't,be,having,the,county,laughing,at,his,daughter,<END>
and,how,they,would,all,laugh,now,<END>
clammy,perspiration,starting,under,her,armpits,began,to,creep,down,her,ribs,<END>
melanie's,voice,measured,and,peaceful,a,little,reproving,rose,above,the,others,<END>
honey,you,know,that,isn't,so,<END>
and,it's,so,unkind,<END>
it,is,too,melly,and,if,you,weren't,always,so,busy,looking,for,the,good,in,people,that,haven't,got,any,good,in,them,you'd,see,it,<END>
and,i'm,glad,it's,so,<END>
it,serves,her,right,<END>
all,scarlett,o'hara,has,ever,done,has,been,to,stir,up,trouble,and,try,to,get,other,girls',beaux,<END>
you,know,mighty,well,she,took,stuart,from,india,and,she,didn't,want,him,<END>
and,today,she,tried,to,take,mr,kennedy,and,ashley,and,charles,<END>
i,must,get,home,<END>
thought,scarlett,<END>
i,must,get,home,<END>
if,she,could,only,be,transferred,by,magic,to,tara,and,to,safety,<END>
if,she,could,only,be,with,ellen,just,to,see,her,to,hold,onto,her,skirt,to,cry,and,pour,out,the,whole,story,in,her,lap,<END>
if,she,had,to,listen,to,another,word,she'd,rush,in,and,pull,out,honey's,straggly,pale,hair,in,big,handfuls,and,spit,on,melanie,hamilton,to,show,her,just,what,she,thought,of,her,charity,<END>
but,she'd,already,acted,common,enough,today,enough,like,white,trash,that,was,where,all,her,trouble,lay,<END>
she,pressed,her,hands,hard,against,her,skirts,so,they,would,not,rustle,and,backed,out,as,stealthily,as,an,animal,<END>
home,she,thought,as,she,sped,down,the,hall,past,the,closed,doors,and,still,rooms,i,must,go,home,<END>
she,was,already,on,the,front,porch,when,a,new,thought,brought,her,up,sharply,she,couldn't,go,home,<END>
she,couldn't,run,away,<END>
she,would,have,to,see,it,through,bear,all,the,malice,of,the,girls,and,her,own,humiliation,and,heartbreak,<END>
to,run,away,would,only,give,them,more,ammunition,<END>
she,pounded,her,clenched,fist,against,the,tall,white,pillar,beside,her,and,she,wished,that,she,were,samson,so,that,she,could,pull,down,all,of,twelve,oaks,and,destroy,every,person,in,it,<END>
she'd,make,them,sorry,<END>
she'd,show,them,<END>
she,didn't,quite,see,how,she'd,show,them,but,she'd,do,it,all,the,same,<END>
she'd,hurt,them,worse,than,they,hurt,her,<END>
for,the,moment,ashley,as,ashley,was,forgotten,<END>
he,was,not,the,tall,drowsy,boy,she,loved,but,part,and,parcel,of,the,wilkeses,twelve,oaks,the,county,and,she,hated,them,all,because,they,laughed,<END>
vanity,was,stronger,than,love,at,sixteen,and,there,was,no,room,in,her,hot,heart,now,for,anything,but,hate,<END>
i,won't,go,home,she,thought,<END>
i'll,stay,here,and,i'll,make,them,sorry,<END>
and,i'll,never,tell,mother,<END>
no,i'll,never,tell,anybody,<END>
she,braced,herself,to,go,back,into,the,house,to,reclimb,the,stairs,and,go,into,another,bedroom,<END>
as,she,turned,she,saw,charles,coming,into,the,house,from,the,other,end,of,the,long,hall,<END>
when,he,saw,her,he,hurried,toward,her,<END>
his,hair,was,tousled,and,his,face,near,geranium,with,excitement,<END>
do,you,know,what's,happened,<END>
he,cried,even,before,he,reached,her,<END>
have,you,heard,<END>
paul,wilson,just,rode,over,from,jonesboro,with,the,news,<END>
he,paused,breathless,as,he,came,up,to,her,<END>
she,said,nothing,and,only,stared,at,him,<END>
mr,lincoln,has,called,for,men,soldiers,i,mean,volunteers,seventy-five,thousand,of,them,<END>
mr,lincoln,again,<END>
didn't,men,ever,think,about,anything,that,really,mattered,<END>
here,was,this,fool,expecting,her,to,be,excited,about,mr,lincoln's,didoes,when,her,heart,was,broken,and,her,reputation,as,good,as,ruined,<END>
charles,stared,at,her,<END>
her,face,was,paper,white,and,her,narrow,eyes,blazing,like,emeralds,<END>
he,had,never,seen,such,fire,in,any,girl's,face,such,a,glow,in,anyone's,eyes,<END>
i'm,so,clumsy,he,said,<END>
i,should,have,told,you,more,gently,<END>
i,forgot,how,delicate,ladies,are,<END>
i'm,sorry,i've,upset,you,so,<END>
you,don't,feel,faint,do,you,<END>
can,i,get,you,a,glass,of,water,<END>
no,she,said,and,managed,a,crooked,smile,<END>
shall,we,go,sit,on,the,bench,<END>
he,asked,taking,her,arm,<END>
she,nodded,and,he,carefully,handed,her,down,the,front,steps,and,led,her,across,the,grass,to,the,iron,bench,beneath,the,largest,oak,in,the,front,yard,<END>
how,fragile,and,tender,women,are,he,thought,the,mere,mention,of,war,and,harshness,makes,them,faint,<END>
the,idea,made,him,feel,very,masculine,and,he,was,doubly,gentle,as,he,seated,her,<END>
she,looked,so,strangely,and,there,was,a,wild,beauty,about,her,white,face,that,set,his,heart,leaping,<END>
could,it,be,that,she,was,distressed,by,the,thought,that,he,might,go,to,the,war,<END>
no,that,was,too,conceited,for,belief,<END>
but,why,did,she,look,at,him,so,oddly,<END>
and,why,did,her,hands,shake,as,they,fingered,her,lace,handkerchief,<END>
and,her,thick,sooty,lashes,they,were,fluttering,just,like,the,eyes,of,girls,in,romances,he,had,read,fluttering,with,timidity,and,love,<END>
he,cleared,his,throat,three,times,to,speak,and,failed,each,time,<END>
he,dropped,his,eyes,because,her,own,green,ones,met,his,so,piercingly,almost,as,if,she,were,not,seeing,him,<END>
he,has,a,lot,of,money,she,was,thinking,swiftly,as,a,thought,and,a,plan,went,through,her,brain,<END>
and,he,hasn't,any,parents,to,bother,me,and,he,lives,in,atlanta,<END>
and,if,i,married,him,right,away,it,would,show,ashley,that,i,didn't,care,a,rap,that,i,was,only,flirting,with,him,<END>
and,it,would,just,kill,honey,<END>
she'd,never,never,catch,another,beau,and,everybody'd,laugh,fit,to,die,at,her,<END>
and,it,would,hurt,melanie,because,she,loves,charles,so,much,<END>
and,it,would,hurt,stu,and,brent,she,didn't,quite,know,why,she,wanted,to,hurt,them,except,that,they,had,catty,sisters,<END>
and,they'd,all,be,sorry,when,i,came,back,here,to,visit,in,a,fine,carriage,and,with,lots,of,pretty,clothes,and,a,house,of,my,own,<END>
and,they,would,never,never,laugh,at,me,<END>
of,course,it,will,mean,fighting,said,charles,after,several,more,embarrassed,attempts,<END>
but,don't,you,fret,miss,scarlett,it'll,be,over,in,a,month,and,we'll,have,them,howling,<END>
yes,sir,<END>
howling,<END>
i,wouldn't,miss,it,for,anything,<END>
i'm,afraid,there,won't,be,much,of,a,ball,tonight,because,the,troop,is,going,to,meet,at,jonesboro,<END>
the,tarleton,boys,have,gone,to,spread,the,news,<END>
i,know,the,ladies,will,be,sorry,<END>
she,said,oh,for,want,of,anything,better,but,it,sufficed,<END>
coolness,was,beginning,to,come,back,to,her,and,her,mind,was,collecting,itself,<END>
a,frost,lay,over,all,her,emotions,and,she,thought,that,she,would,never,feel,anything,warmly,again,<END>
why,not,take,this,pretty,flushed,boy,<END>
he,was,as,good,as,anyone,else,and,she,didn't,care,<END>
no,she,could,never,care,about,anything,again,not,if,she,lived,to,be,ninety,<END>
i,can't,decide,now,whether,to,go,with,mr,wade,hampton's,south,carolina,legion,or,with,the,atlanta,gate,city,guard,<END>
she,said,oh,again,and,their,eyes,met,and,the,fluttering,lashes,were,his,undoing,<END>
will,you,wait,for,me,miss,scarlett,<END>
it,it,would,be,heaven,just,knowing,that,you,were,waiting,for,me,until,after,we,licked,them,<END>
he,hung,breathless,on,her,words,watching,the,way,her,lips,curled,up,at,the,corners,noting,for,the,first,time,the,shadows,about,these,corners,and,thinking,what,it,would,mean,to,kiss,them,<END>
her,hand,with,palm,clammy,with,perspiration,slid,into,his,<END>
i,wouldn't,want,to,wait,she,said,and,her,eyes,were,veiled,<END>
he,sat,clutching,her,hand,his,mouth,wide,open,<END>
watching,him,from,under,her,lashes,scarlett,thought,detachedly,that,he,looked,like,a,gigged,frog,<END>
he,stuttered,several,times,closed,his,mouth,and,opened,it,again,and,again,became,geranium,colored,<END>
can,you,possibly,love,me,<END>
she,said,nothing,but,looked,down,into,her,lap,and,charles,was,thrown,into,new,states,of,ecstasy,and,embarrassment,<END>
perhaps,a,man,should,not,ask,a,girl,such,a,question,<END>
perhaps,it,would,be,unmaidenly,for,her,to,answer,it,<END>
having,never,possessed,the,courage,to,get,himself,into,such,a,situation,before,charles,was,at,a,loss,as,to,how,to,act,<END>
he,wanted,to,shout,and,to,sing,and,to,kiss,her,and,to,caper,about,the,lawn,and,then,run,tell,everyone,black,and,white,that,she,loved,him,<END>
but,he,only,squeezed,her,hand,until,he,drove,her,rings,into,the,flesh,<END>
you,will,marry,me,soon,miss,scarlett,<END>
um,she,said,fingering,a,fold,of,her,dress,<END>
shall,we,make,it,a,double,wedding,with,mel,<END>
no,she,said,quickly,her,eyes,glinting,up,at,him,ominously,<END>
charles,knew,again,that,he,had,made,an,error,<END>
of,course,a,girl,wanted,her,own,wedding,not,shared,glory,<END>
how,kind,she,was,to,overlook,his,blunderings,<END>
if,it,were,only,dark,and,he,had,the,courage,of,shadows,and,could,kiss,her,hand,and,say,the,things,he,longed,to,say,<END>
when,may,i,speak,to,your,father,<END>
the,sooner,the,better,she,said,hoping,that,perhaps,he,would,release,the,crushing,pressure,on,her,rings,before,she,had,to,ask,him,to,do,it,<END>
he,leaped,up,and,for,a,moment,she,thought,he,was,going,to,cut,a,caper,before,dignity,claimed,him,<END>
he,looked,down,at,her,radiantly,his,whole,clean,simple,heart,in,his,eyes,<END>
she,had,never,had,anyone,look,at,her,thus,before,and,would,never,have,it,from,any,other,man,but,in,her,queer,detachment,she,only,thought,that,he,looked,like,a,calf,<END>
i'll,go,now,and,find,your,father,he,said,smiling,all,over,his,face,<END>
i,can't,wait,<END>
will,you,excuse,me,dear,<END>
the,endearment,came,hard,but,having,said,it,once,he,repeated,it,again,with,pleasure,<END>
yes,she,said,<END>
i'll,wait,here,<END>
it's,so,cool,and,nice,here,<END>
he,went,off,across,the,lawn,and,disappeared,around,the,house,and,she,was,alone,under,the,rustling,oak,<END>
from,the,stables,men,were,streaming,out,on,horseback,negro,servants,riding,hard,behind,their,masters,<END>
the,munroe,boys,tore,past,waving,their,hats,and,the,fontaines,and,calverts,went,down,the,road,yelling,<END>
the,four,tarletons,charged,across,the,lawn,by,her,and,brent,shouted,mother's,going,to,give,us,the,horses,<END>
yee-aay-ee,<END>
turf,flew,and,they,were,gone,leaving,her,alone,again,<END>
the,white,house,reared,its,tall,columns,before,her,seeming,to,withdraw,with,dignified,aloofness,from,her,<END>
it,would,never,be,her,house,now,<END>
ashley,would,never,carry,her,over,the,threshold,as,his,bride,<END>
oh,ashley,ashley,<END>
what,have,i,done,<END>
deep,in,her,under,layers,of,hurt,pride,and,cold,practicality,something,stirred,hurtingly,<END>
an,adult,emotion,was,being,born,stronger,than,her,vanity,or,her,willful,selfishness,<END>
she,loved,ashley,and,she,knew,she,loved,him,and,she,had,never,cared,so,much,as,in,that,instant,when,she,saw,charles,disappearing,around,the,curved,graveled,walk,<END>
chapter,vii,<END>
within,two,weeks,scarlett,had,become,a,wife,and,within,two,months,more,she,was,a,widow,<END>
she,was,soon,released,from,the,bonds,she,had,assumed,with,so,much,haste,and,so,little,thought,but,she,was,never,again,to,know,the,careless,freedom,of,her,unmarried,days,<END>
widowhood,had,crowded,closely,on,the,heels,of,marriage,but,to,her,dismay,motherhood,soon,followed,<END>
in,after,years,when,she,thought,of,those,last,days,of,april,1861,scarlett,could,never,quite,remember,details,<END>
time,and,events,were,telescoped,jumbled,together,like,a,nightmare,that,had,no,reality,or,reason,<END>
till,the,day,she,died,there,would,be,blank,spots,in,her,memories,of,those,days,<END>
especially,vague,were,her,recollections,of,the,time,between,her,acceptance,of,charles,and,her,wedding,<END>
two,weeks,<END>
so,short,an,engagement,would,have,been,impossible,in,times,of,peace,<END>
then,there,would,have,been,a,decorous,interval,of,a,year,or,at,least,six,months,<END>
but,the,south,was,aflame,with,war,events,roared,along,as,swiftly,as,if,carried,by,a,mighty,wind,and,the,slow,tempo,of,the,old,days,was,gone,<END>
ellen,had,wrung,her,hands,and,counseled,delay,in,order,that,scarlett,might,think,the,matter,over,at,greater,length,<END>
but,to,her,pleadings,scarlett,turned,a,sullen,face,and,a,deaf,ear,<END>
marry,she,would,<END>
and,quickly,too,<END>
within,two,weeks,<END>
learning,that,ashley's,wedding,had,been,moved,up,from,the,autumn,to,the,first,of,may,so,he,could,leave,with,the,troop,as,soon,as,it,was,called,into,service,scarlett,set,the,date,of,her,wedding,for,the,day,before,his,<END>
ellen,protested,but,charles,pleaded,with,new-found,eloquence,for,he,was,impatient,to,be,off,to,south,carolina,to,join,wade,hampton's,legion,and,gerald,sided,with,the,two,young,people,<END>
he,was,excited,by,the,war,fever,and,pleased,that,scarlett,had,made,so,good,a,match,and,who,was,he,to,stand,in,the,way,of,young,love,when,there,was,a,war,<END>
ellen,distracted,finally,gave,in,as,other,mothers,throughout,the,south,were,doing,<END>
their,leisured,world,had,been,turned,topsy-turvy,and,their,pleadings,prayers,and,advice,availed,nothing,against,the,powerful,forces,sweeping,them,along,<END>
the,south,was,intoxicated,with,enthusiasm,and,excitement,<END>
everyone,knew,that,one,battle,would,end,the,war,and,every,young,man,hastened,to,enlist,before,the,war,should,end,hastened,to,marry,his,sweetheart,before,he,rushed,off,to,virginia,to,strike,a,blow,at,the,yankees,<END>
there,were,dozens,of,war,weddings,in,the,county,and,there,was,little,time,for,the,sorrow,of,parting,for,everyone,was,too,busy,and,excited,for,either,solemn,thoughts,or,tears,<END>
the,ladies,were,making,uniforms,knitting,socks,and,rolling,bandages,and,the,men,were,drilling,and,shooting,<END>
train,loads,of,troops,passed,through,jonesboro,daily,on,their,way,north,to,atlanta,and,virginia,<END>
some,detachments,were,gaily,uniformed,in,the,scarlets,and,light,blues,and,greens,of,select,social-militia,companies,some,small,groups,were,in,homespun,and,coonskin,caps,others,ununiformed,were,in,broadcloth,and,fine,linen,all,were,half-drilled,half-armed,wild,with,excitement,and,shouting,as,though,en,route,to,a,picnic,<END>
the,sight,of,these,men,threw,the,county,boys,into,a,panic,for,fear,the,war,would,be,over,before,they,could,reach,virginia,and,preparations,for,the,troop's,departure,were,speeded,<END>
in,the,midst,of,this,turmoil,preparations,went,forward,for,scarlett's,wedding,and,almost,before,she,knew,it,she,was,clad,in,ellen's,wedding,dress,and,veil,coming,down,the,wide,stairs,of,tara,on,her,father's,arm,to,face,a,house,packed,full,with,guests,<END>
afterward,she,remembered,as,from,a,dream,the,hundreds,of,candles,flaring,on,the,walls,her,mother's,face,loving,a,little,bewildered,her,lips,moving,in,a,silent,prayer,for,her,daughter's,happiness,gerald,flushed,with,brandy,and,pride,that,his,daughter,was,marrying,both,money,a,fine,name,and,an,old,one,and,ashley,standing,at,the,bottom,of,the,steps,with,melanie's,arm,through,his,<END>
when,she,saw,the,look,on,his,face,she,thought,this,can't,be,real,<END>
it,can't,be,<END>
it's,a,nightmare,<END>
i'll,wake,up,and,find,it's,all,been,a,nightmare,<END>
i,mustn't,think,of,it,now,or,i'll,begin,screaming,in,front,of,all,these,people,<END>
i,can't,think,now,<END>
i'll,think,later,when,i,can,stand,it,when,i,can't,see,his,eyes,<END>
it,was,all,very,dreamlike,the,passage,through,the,aisle,of,smiling,people,charles',scarlet,face,and,stammering,voice,and,her,own,replies,so,startlingly,clear,so,cold,<END>
and,the,congratulations,afterward,and,the,kissing,and,the,toasts,and,the,dancing,all,all,like,a,dream,<END>
even,the,feel,of,ashley's,kiss,upon,her,cheek,even,melanie's,soft,whisper,now,we're,really,and,truly,sisters,were,unreal,<END>
even,the,excitement,caused,by,the,swooning,spell,that,overtook,charles',plump,emotional,aunt,miss,pittypat,hamilton,had,the,quality,of,a,nightmare,<END>
but,when,the,dancing,and,toasting,were,finally,ended,and,the,dawn,was,coming,when,all,the,atlanta,guests,who,could,be,crowded,into,tara,and,the,overseer's,house,had,gone,to,sleep,on,beds,sofas,and,pallets,on,the,floor,and,all,the,neighbors,had,gone,home,to,rest,in,preparation,for,the,wedding,at,twelve,oaks,the,next,day,then,the,dreamlike,trance,shattered,like,crystal,before,reality,<END>
the,reality,was,the,blushing,charles,emerging,from,her,dressing,room,in,his,nightshirt,avoiding,the,startled,look,she,gave,him,over,the,high-pulled,sheet,<END>
of,course,she,knew,that,married,people,occupied,the,same,bed,but,she,had,never,given,the,matter,a,thought,before,<END>
it,seemed,very,natural,in,the,case,of,her,mother,and,father,but,she,had,never,applied,it,to,herself,<END>
now,for,the,first,time,since,the,barbecue,she,realized,just,what,she,had,brought,on,herself,<END>
the,thought,of,this,strange,boy,whom,she,hadn't,really,wanted,to,marry,getting,into,bed,with,her,when,her,heart,was,breaking,with,an,agony,of,regret,at,her,hasty,action,and,the,anguish,of,losing,ashley,forever,was,too,much,to,be,borne,<END>
as,he,hesitatingly,approached,the,bed,she,spoke,in,a,hoarse,whisper,<END>
i'll,scream,out,loud,if,you,come,near,me,<END>
i,will,<END>
i,will,at,the,top,of,my,voice,<END>
get,away,from,me,<END>
don't,you,dare,touch,me,<END>
so,charles,hamilton,spent,his,wedding,night,in,an,armchair,in,the,corner,not,too,unhappily,for,he,understood,or,thought,he,understood,the,modesty,and,delicacy,of,his,bride,<END>
he,was,willing,to,wait,until,her,fears,subsided,only,only,he,sighed,as,he,twisted,about,seeking,a,comfortable,position,for,he,was,going,away,to,the,war,so,very,soon,<END>
nightmarish,as,her,own,wedding,had,been,ashley's,wedding,was,even,worse,<END>
scarlett,stood,in,her,apple-green,second-day,dress,in,the,parlor,of,twelve,oaks,amid,the,blaze,of,hundreds,of,candles,jostled,by,the,same,throng,as,the,night,before,and,saw,the,plain,little,face,of,melanie,hamilton,glow,into,beauty,as,she,became,melanie,wilkes,<END>
now,ashley,was,gone,forever,<END>
her,ashley,<END>
no,not,her,ashley,now,<END>
had,he,ever,been,hers,<END>
it,was,all,so,mixed,up,in,her,mind,and,her,mind,was,so,tired,so,bewildered,<END>
he,had,said,he,loved,her,but,what,was,it,that,had,separated,them,<END>
if,she,could,only,remember,<END>
she,had,stilled,the,county's,gossiping,tongue,by,marrying,charles,but,what,did,that,matter,now,<END>
it,had,seemed,so,important,once,but,now,it,didn't,seem,important,at,all,<END>
all,that,mattered,was,ashley,<END>
now,he,was,gone,and,she,was,married,to,a,man,she,not,only,did,not,love,but,for,whom,she,had,an,active,contempt,<END>
oh,how,she,regretted,it,all,<END>
she,had,often,heard,of,people,cutting,off,their,noses,to,spite,their,faces,but,heretofore,it,had,been,only,a,figure,of,speech,<END>
now,she,knew,just,what,it,meant,<END>
and,mingled,with,her,frenzied,desire,to,be,free,of,charles,and,safely,back,at,tara,an,unmarried,girl,again,ran,the,knowledge,that,she,had,only,herself,to,blame,<END>
ellen,had,tried,to,stop,her,and,she,would,not,listen,<END>
so,she,danced,through,the,night,of,ashley's,wedding,in,a,daze,and,said,things,mechanically,and,smiled,and,irrelevantly,wondered,at,the,stupidity,of,people,who,thought,her,a,happy,bride,and,could,not,see,that,her,heart,was,broken,<END>
well,thank,god,they,couldn't,see,<END>
that,night,after,mammy,had,helped,her,undress,and,had,departed,and,charles,had,emerged,shyly,from,the,dressing,room,wondering,if,he,was,to,spend,a,second,night,in,the,horsehair,chair,she,burst,into,tears,<END>
she,cried,until,charles,climbed,into,bed,beside,her,and,tried,to,comfort,her,cried,without,words,until,no,more,tears,would,come,and,at,last,she,lay,sobbing,quietly,on,his,shoulder,<END>
if,there,had,not,been,a,war,there,would,have,been,a,week,of,visiting,about,the,county,with,balls,and,barbecues,in,honor,of,the,two,newly,married,couples,before,they,set,off,to,saratoga,or,white,sulphur,for,wedding,trips,<END>
if,there,had,not,been,a,war,scarlett,would,have,had,third-day,and,fourth-day,and,fifth-day,dresses,to,wear,to,the,fontaine,and,calvert,and,tarleton,parties,in,her,honor,<END>
but,there,were,no,parties,now,and,no,wedding,trips,<END>
a,week,after,the,wedding,charles,left,to,join,colonel,wade,hampton,and,two,weeks,later,ashley,and,the,troop,departed,leaving,the,whole,county,bereft,<END>
in,those,two,weeks,scarlett,never,saw,ashley,alone,never,had,a,private,word,with,him,<END>
not,even,at,the,terrible,moment,of,parting,when,he,stopped,by,tara,on,his,way,to,the,train,did,she,have,a,private,talk,<END>
melanie,bonneted,and,shawled,sedate,in,newly,acquired,matronly,dignity,hung,on,his,arm,and,the,entire,personnel,of,tara,black,and,white,turned,out,to,see,ashley,off,to,the,war,<END>
melanie,said,you,must,kiss,scarlett,ashley,<END>
she's,my,sister,now,and,ashley,bent,and,touched,her,cheek,with,cold,lips,his,face,drawn,and,taut,<END>
scarlett,could,hardly,take,any,joy,from,that,kiss,so,sullen,was,her,heart,at,melly's,prompting,it,<END>
melanie,smothered,her,with,an,embrace,at,parting,<END>
you,will,come,to,atlanta,and,visit,me,and,aunt,pittypat,won't,you,<END>
oh,darling,we,want,to,have,you,so,much,<END>
we,want,to,know,charlie's,wife,better,<END>
five,weeks,passed,during,which,letters,shy,ecstatic,loving,came,from,charles,in,south,carolina,telling,of,his,love,his,plans,for,the,future,when,the,war,was,over,his,desire,to,become,a,hero,for,her,sake,and,his,worship,of,his,commander,wade,hampton,<END>
in,the,seventh,week,there,came,a,telegram,from,colonel,hampton,himself,and,then,a,letter,a,kind,dignified,letter,of,condolence,<END>
charles,was,dead,<END>
the,colonel,would,have,wired,earlier,but,charles,thinking,his,illness,a,trifling,one,did,not,wish,to,have,his,family,worried,<END>
the,unfortunate,boy,had,not,only,been,cheated,of,the,love,he,thought,he,had,won,but,also,of,his,high,hopes,of,honor,and,glory,on,the,field,of,battle,<END>
he,had,died,ignominiously,and,swiftly,of,pneumonia,following,measles,without,ever,having,gotten,any,closer,to,the,yankees,than,the,camp,in,south,carolina,<END>
in,due,time,charles',son,was,born,and,because,it,was,fashionable,to,name,boys,after,their,fathers',commanding,officers,he,was,called,wade,hampton,hamilton,<END>
scarlett,had,wept,with,despair,at,the,knowledge,that,she,was,pregnant,and,wished,that,she,were,dead,<END>
but,she,carried,the,child,through,its,time,with,a,minimum,of,discomfort,bore,him,with,little,distress,and,recovered,so,quickly,that,mammy,told,her,privately,it,was,downright,common,ladies,should,suffer,more,<END>
she,felt,little,affection,for,the,child,hide,the,fact,though,she,might,<END>
she,had,not,wanted,him,and,she,resented,his,coming,and,now,that,he,was,here,it,did,not,seem,possible,that,he,was,hers,a,part,of,her,<END>
though,she,recovered,physically,from,wade's,birth,in,a,disgracefully,short,time,mentally,she,was,dazed,and,sick,<END>
her,spirits,drooped,despite,the,efforts,of,the,whole,plantation,to,revive,them,<END>
ellen,went,about,with,a,puckered,worried,forehead,and,gerald,swore,more,frequently,than,usual,and,brought,her,useless,gifts,from,jonesboro,<END>
even,old,dr,fontaine,admitted,that,he,was,puzzled,after,his,tonic,of,sulphur,molasses,and,herbs,failed,to,perk,her,up,<END>
he,told,ellen,privately,that,it,was,a,broken,heart,that,made,scarlett,so,irritable,and,listless,by,turns,<END>
but,scarlett,had,she,wished,to,speak,could,have,told,them,that,it,was,a,far,different,and,more,complex,trouble,<END>
she,did,not,tell,them,that,it,was,utter,boredom,bewilderment,at,actually,being,a,mother,and,most,of,all,the,absence,of,ashley,that,made,her,look,so,woebegone,<END>
her,boredom,was,acute,and,ever,present,<END>
the,county,had,been,devoid,of,any,entertainment,or,social,life,ever,since,the,troop,had,gone,away,to,war,<END>
all,of,the,interesting,young,men,were,gone,the,four,tarletons,the,two,calverts,the,fontaines,the,munroes,and,everyone,from,jonesboro,fayetteville,and,lovejoy,who,was,young,and,attractive,<END>
only,the,older,men,the,cripples,and,the,women,were,left,and,they,spent,their,time,knitting,and,sewing,growing,more,cotton,and,corn,raising,more,hogs,and,sheep,and,cows,for,the,army,<END>
there,was,never,a,sight,of,a,real,man,except,when,the,commissary,troop,under,suellen's,middle-aged,beau,frank,kennedy,rode,by,every,month,to,collect,supplies,<END>
the,men,in,the,commissary,were,not,very,exciting,and,the,sight,of,frank's,timid,courting,annoyed,her,until,she,found,it,difficult,to,be,polite,to,him,<END>
if,he,and,suellen,would,only,get,it,over,with,<END>
even,if,the,commissary,troop,had,been,more,interesting,it,would,not,have,helped,her,situation,any,<END>
she,was,a,widow,and,her,heart,was,in,the,grave,<END>
at,least,everyone,thought,it,was,in,the,grave,and,expected,her,to,act,accordingly,<END>
this,irritated,her,for,try,as,she,would,she,could,recall,nothing,about,charles,except,the,dying-calf,look,on,his,face,when,she,told,him,she,would,marry,him,<END>
and,even,that,picture,was,fading,<END>
but,she,was,a,widow,and,she,had,to,watch,her,behavior,<END>
not,for,her,the,pleasures,of,unmarried,girls,<END>
she,had,to,be,grave,and,aloof,<END>
ellen,had,stressed,this,at,great,length,after,catching,frank's,lieutenant,swinging,scarlett,in,the,garden,swing,and,making,her,squeal,with,laughter,<END>
deeply,distressed,ellen,had,told,her,how,easily,a,widow,might,get,herself,talked,about,<END>
the,conduct,of,a,widow,must,be,twice,as,circumspect,as,that,of,a,matron,<END>
and,god,only,knows,thought,scarlett,listening,obediently,to,her,mother's,soft,voice,matrons,never,have,any,fun,at,all,<END>
so,widows,might,as,well,be,dead,<END>
a,widow,had,to,wear,hideous,black,dresses,without,even,a,touch,of,braid,to,enliven,them,no,flower,or,ribbon,or,lace,or,even,jewelry,except,onyx,mourning,brooches,or,necklaces,made,from,the,deceased's,hair,<END>
and,the,black,crepe,veil,on,her,bonnet,had,to,reach,to,her,knees,and,only,after,three,years,of,widowhood,could,it,be,shortened,to,shoulder,length,<END>
widows,could,never,chatter,vivaciously,or,laugh,aloud,<END>
even,when,they,smiled,it,must,be,a,sad,tragic,smile,<END>
and,most,dreadful,of,all,they,could,in,no,way,indicate,an,interest,in,the,company,of,gentlemen,<END>
and,should,a,gentleman,be,so,ill,bred,as,to,indicate,an,interest,in,her,she,must,freeze,him,with,a,dignified,but,well-chosen,reference,to,her,dead,husband,<END>
oh,yes,thought,scarlett,drearily,some,widows,do,remarry,eventually,when,they,are,old,and,stringy,<END>
though,heaven,knows,how,they,manage,it,with,their,neighbors,watching,<END>
and,then,it's,generally,to,some,desperate,old,widower,with,a,large,plantation,and,a,dozen,children,<END>
marriage,was,bad,enough,but,to,be,widowed,oh,then,life,was,over,forever,<END>
how,stupid,people,were,when,they,talked,about,what,a,comfort,little,wade,hampton,must,be,to,her,now,that,charles,was,gone,<END>
how,stupid,of,them,to,say,that,now,she,had,something,to,live,for,<END>
everyone,talked,about,how,sweet,it,was,that,she,had,this,posthumous,token,of,her,love,and,she,naturally,did,not,disabuse,their,minds,<END>
but,that,thought,was,farthest,from,her,mind,<END>
she,had,very,little,interest,in,wade,and,sometimes,it,was,difficult,to,remember,that,he,was,actually,hers,<END>
every,morning,she,woke,up,and,for,a,drowsy,moment,she,was,scarlett,o'hara,again,and,the,sun,was,bright,in,the,magnolia,outside,her,window,and,the,mockers,were,singing,and,the,sweet,smell,of,frying,bacon,was,stealing,to,her,nostrils,<END>
she,was,carefree,and,young,again,<END>
then,she,heard,the,fretful,hungry,wail,and,always,always,there,was,a,startled,moment,when,she,thought,why,there's,a,baby,in,the,house,<END>
then,she,remembered,that,it,was,her,baby,<END>
it,was,all,very,bewildering,<END>
and,ashley,<END>
oh,most,of,all,ashley,<END>
for,the,first,time,in,her,life,she,hated,tara,hated,the,long,red,road,that,led,down,the,hill,to,the,river,hated,the,red,fields,with,springing,green,cotton,<END>
every,foot,of,ground,every,tree,and,brook,every,lane,and,bridle,path,reminded,her,of,him,<END>
he,belonged,to,another,woman,and,he,had,gone,to,the,war,but,his,ghost,still,haunted,the,roads,in,the,twilight,still,smiled,at,her,from,drowsy,gray,eyes,in,the,shadows,of,the,porch,<END>
she,never,heard,the,sound,of,hooves,coming,up,the,river,road,from,twelve,oaks,that,for,a,sweet,moment,she,did,not,think,ashley,<END>
she,hated,twelve,oaks,now,and,once,she,had,loved,it,<END>
she,hated,it,but,she,was,drawn,there,so,she,could,hear,john,wilkes,and,the,girls,talk,about,him,hear,them,read,his,letters,from,virginia,<END>
they,hurt,her,but,she,had,to,hear,them,<END>
she,disliked,the,stiff-,necked,india,and,the,foolish,prattling,honey,and,knew,they,disliked,her,equally,but,she,could,not,stay,away,from,them,<END>
and,every,time,she,came,home,from,twelve,oaks,she,lay,down,on,her,bed,morosely,and,refused,to,get,up,for,supper,<END>
it,was,this,refusal,of,food,that,worried,ellen,and,mammy,more,than,anything,else,<END>
mammy,brought,up,tempting,trays,insinuating,that,now,she,was,a,widow,she,might,eat,as,much,as,she,pleased,but,scarlett,had,no,appetite,<END>
when,dr,fontaine,told,ellen,gravely,that,heartbreak,frequently,led,to,a,decline,and,women,pined,away,into,the,grave,ellen,went,white,for,that,fear,was,what,she,had,carried,in,her,heart,<END>
isn't,there,anything,to,be,done,doctor,<END>
a,change,of,scene,will,be,the,best,thing,in,the,world,for,her,said,the,doctor,only,too,anxious,to,be,rid,of,an,unsatisfactory,patient,<END>
so,scarlett,unenthusiastic,went,off,with,her,child,first,to,visit,her,o'hara,and,robillard,relatives,in,savannah,and,then,to,ellen's,sisters,pauline,and,eulalie,in,charleston,<END>
but,she,was,back,at,tara,a,month,before,ellen,expected,her,with,no,explanation,of,her,return,<END>
they,had,been,kind,in,savannah,but,james,and,andrew,and,their,wives,were,old,and,content,to,sit,quietly,and,talk,of,a,past,in,which,scarlett,had,no,interest,<END>
it,was,the,same,with,the,robillards,and,charleston,was,terrible,scarlett,thought,<END>
aunt,pauline,and,her,husband,a,little,old,man,with,a,formal,brittle,courtesy,and,the,absent,air,of,one,living,in,an,older,age,lived,on,a,plantation,on,the,river,far,more,isolated,than,tara,<END>
their,nearest,neighbor,was,twenty,miles,away,by,dark,roads,through,still,jungles,of,cypress,swamp,and,oak,<END>
the,live,oaks,with,their,waving,curtains,of,gray,moss,gave,scarlett,the,creeps,and,always,brought,to,her,mind,gerald's,stories,of,irish,ghosts,roaming,in,shimmering,gray,mists,<END>
there,was,nothing,to,do,but,knit,all,day,and,at,night,listen,to,uncle,carey,read,aloud,from,the,improving,works,of,mr,bulwer-lytton,<END>
eulalie,hidden,behind,a,high-walled,garden,in,a,great,house,on,the,battery,in,charleston,was,no,more,entertaining,<END>
scarlett,accustomed,to,wide,vistas,of,rolling,red,hills,felt,that,she,was,in,prison,<END>
there,was,more,social,life,here,than,at,aunt,pauline's,but,scarlett,did,not,like,the,people,who,called,with,their,airs,and,their,traditions,and,their,emphasis,on,family,<END>
she,knew,very,well,they,all,thought,she,was,a,child,of,a,mesalliance,and,wondered,how,a,robillard,ever,married,a,newly,come,irishman,<END>
scarlett,felt,that,aunt,eulalie,apologized,for,her,behind,her,back,<END>
this,aroused,her,temper,for,she,cared,no,more,about,family,than,her,father,<END>
she,was,proud,of,gerald,and,what,he,had,accomplished,unaided,except,by,his,shrewd,irish,brain,<END>
and,the,charlestonians,took,so,much,upon,themselves,about,fort,sumter,<END>
good,heavens,didn't,they,realize,that,if,they,hadn't,been,silly,enough,to,fire,the,shot,that,started,the,war,some,other,fools,would,have,done,it,<END>
accustomed,to,the,brisk,voices,of,upland,georgia,the,drawling,flat,voices,of,the,low,country,seemed,affected,to,her,<END>
she,thought,if,she,ever,again,heard,voices,that,said,paams,for,palms,and,hoose,for,house,and,woon't,for,won't,and,maa,and,paa,for,ma,and,pa,she,would,scream,<END>
it,irritated,her,so,much,that,during,one,formal,call,she,aped,gerald's,brogue,to,her,aunt's,distress,<END>
then,she,went,back,to,tara,<END>
better,to,be,tormented,with,memories,of,ashley,than,charleston,accents,<END>
ellen,busy,night,and,day,doubling,the,productiveness,of,tara,to,aid,the,confederacy,was,terrified,when,her,eldest,daughter,came,home,from,charleston,thin,white,and,sharp,tongued,<END>
she,had,known,heartbreak,herself,and,night,after,night,she,lay,beside,the,snoring,gerald,trying,to,think,of,some,way,to,lessen,scarlett's,distress,<END>
charles',aunt,miss,pittypat,hamilton,had,written,her,several,times,urging,her,to,permit,scarlett,to,come,to,atlanta,for,a,long,visit,and,now,for,the,first,time,ellen,considered,it,seriously,<END>
she,and,melanie,were,alone,in,a,big,house,and,without,male,protection,wrote,miss,pittypat,now,that,dear,charlie,has,gone,<END>
of,course,there,is,my,brother,henry,but,he,does,not,make,his,home,with,us,<END>
but,perhaps,scarlett,has,told,you,of,henry,<END>
delicacy,forbids,my,putting,more,concerning,him,on,paper,<END>
melly,and,i,would,feel,so,much,easier,and,safer,if,scarlett,were,with,us,<END>
three,lonely,women,are,better,than,two,<END>
and,perhaps,dear,scarlett,could,find,some,ease,for,her,sorrow,as,melly,is,doing,by,nursing,our,brave,boys,in,the,hospitals,here,and,of,course,melly,and,i,are,longing,to,see,the,dear,baby,<END>
so,scarlett's,trunk,was,packed,again,with,her,mourning,clothes,and,off,she,went,to,atlanta,with,wade,hampton,and,his,nurse,prissy,a,headful,of,admonitions,as,to,her,conduct,from,ellen,and,mammy,and,a,hundred,dollars,in,confederate,bills,from,gerald,<END>
she,did,not,especially,want,to,go,to,atlanta,<END>
she,thought,aunt,pitty,the,silliest,of,old,ladies,and,the,very,idea,of,living,under,the,same,roof,with,ashley's,wife,was,abhorrent,<END>
but,the,county,with,its,memories,was,impossible,now,and,any,change,was,welcome,<END>
part,two,<END>
chapter,viii,<END>
as,the,train,carried,scarlett,northward,that,may,morning,in,1862,she,thought,that,atlanta,couldn't,possibly,be,so,boring,as,charleston,and,savannah,had,been,and,in,spite,of,her,distaste,for,miss,pittypat,and,melanie,she,looked,forward,with,some,curiosity,toward,seeing,how,the,town,had,fared,since,her,last,visit,in,the,winter,before,the,war,began,<END>
atlanta,had,always,interested,her,more,than,any,other,town,because,when,she,was,a,child,gerald,had,told,her,that,she,and,atlanta,were,exactly,the,same,age,<END>
she,discovered,when,she,grew,older,that,gerald,had,stretched,the,truth,somewhat,as,was,his,habit,when,a,little,stretching,would,improve,a,story,but,atlanta,was,only,nine,years,older,than,she,was,and,that,still,left,the,place,amazingly,young,by,comparison,with,any,other,town,she,had,ever,heard,of,<END>
savannah,and,charleston,had,the,dignity,of,their,years,one,being,well,along,in,its,second,century,and,the,other,entering,its,third,and,in,her,young,eyes,they,had,always,seemed,like,aged,grandmothers,fanning,themselves,placidly,in,the,sun,<END>
but,atlanta,was,of,her,own,generation,crude,with,the,crudities,of,youth,and,as,headstrong,and,impetuous,as,herself,<END>
the,story,gerald,had,told,her,was,based,on,the,fact,that,she,and,atlanta,were,christened,in,the,same,year,<END>
in,the,nine,years,before,scarlett,was,born,the,town,had,been,called,first,terminus,and,then,marthasville,and,not,until,the,year,of,scarlett's,birth,had,it,become,atlanta,<END>
when,gerald,first,moved,to,north,georgia,there,had,been,no,atlanta,at,all,not,even,the,semblance,of,a,village,and,wilderness,rolled,over,the,site,<END>
but,the,next,year,in,1836,the,state,had,authorized,the,building,of,a,railroad,northwestward,through,the,territory,which,the,cherokees,had,recently,ceded,<END>
the,destination,of,the,proposed,railroad,tennessee,and,the,west,was,clear,and,definite,but,its,beginning,point,in,georgia,was,somewhat,uncertain,until,a,year,later,an,engineer,drove,a,stake,in,the,red,clay,to,mark,the,southern,end,of,the,line,and,atlanta,born,terminus,had,begun,<END>
there,were,no,railroads,then,in,north,georgia,and,very,few,anywhere,else,<END>
but,during,the,years,before,gerald,married,ellen,the,tiny,settlement,twenty-five,miles,north,of,tara,slowly,grew,into,a,village,and,the,tracks,slowly,pushed,northward,<END>
then,the,railroad,building,era,really,began,<END>
from,the,old,city,of,augusta,a,second,railroad,was,extended,westward,across,the,state,to,connect,with,the,new,road,to,tennessee,<END>
from,the,old,city,of,savannah,a,third,railroad,was,built,first,to,macon,in,the,heart,of,georgia,and,then,north,through,gerald's,own,county,to,atlanta,to,link,up,with,the,other,two,roads,and,give,savannah's,harbor,a,highway,to,the,west,<END>
from,the,same,junction,point,the,young,atlanta,a,fourth,railroad,was,constructed,southwestward,to,montgomery,and,mobile,<END>

with,the,completion,of,the,four,lines,atlanta,was,now,connected,with,the,west,with,the,south,with,the,coast,and,through,augusta,with,the,north,and,east,<END>
it,had,become,the,crossroads,of,travel,north,and,south,and,east,and,west,and,the,little,village,leaped,to,life,<END>
in,a,space,of,time,but,little,longer,than,scarlett's,seventeen,years,atlanta,had,grown,from,a,single,stake,driven,in,the,ground,into,a,thriving,small,city,of,ten,thousand,that,was,the,center,of,attention,for,the,whole,state,<END>
the,older,quieter,cities,were,wont,to,look,upon,the,bustling,new,town,with,the,sensations,of,a,hen,which,has,hatched,a,duckling,<END>
why,was,the,place,so,different,from,the,other,georgia,towns,<END>
why,did,it,grow,so,fast,<END>
after,all,they,thought,it,had,nothing,whatever,to,recommend,it,only,its,railroads,and,a,bunch,of,mighty,pushy,people,<END>
the,people,who,settled,the,town,called,successively,terminus,marthasville,and,atlanta,were,a,pushy,people,<END>
restless,energetic,people,from,the,older,sections,of,georgia,and,from,more,distant,states,were,drawn,to,this,town,that,sprawled,itself,around,the,junction,of,the,railroads,in,its,center,<END>
they,came,with,enthusiasm,<END>
they,built,their,stores,around,the,five,muddy,red,roads,that,crossed,near,the,depot,<END>
they,built,their,fine,homes,on,whitehall,and,washington,streets,and,along,the,high,ridge,of,land,on,which,countless,generations,of,moccasined,indian,feet,had,beaten,a,path,called,the,peachtree,trail,<END>

atlanta,did,not,care,<END>
scarlett,had,always,liked,atlanta,for,the,very,same,reasons,that,made,savannah,augusta,and,macon,condemn,it,<END>
like,herself,the,town,was,a,mixture,of,the,old,and,new,in,georgia,in,which,the,old,often,came,off,second,best,in,its,conflicts,with,the,self-willed,and,vigorous,new,<END>

the,night,before,had,been,wild,and,wet,with,rain,but,when,scarlett,arrived,in,atlanta,a,warm,sun,was,at,work,bravely,attempting,to,dry,the,streets,that,were,winding,rivers,of,red,mud,<END>
in,the,open,space,around,the,depot,the,soft,ground,had,been,cut,and,churned,by,the,constant,flow,of,traffic,in,and,out,until,it,resembled,an,enormous,hog,wallow,and,here,and,there,vehicles,were,mired,to,the,hubs,in,the,ruts,<END>
a,never-ceasing,line,of,army,wagons,and,ambulances,loading,and,unloading,supplies,and,wounded,from,the,trains,made,the,mud,and,confusion,worse,as,they,toiled,in,and,struggled,out,drivers,swearing,mules,plunging,and,mud,spattering,for,yards,<END>

her,recent,graduation,from,a,skinny,pickaninny,with,brief,skirts,and,stiffly,wrapped,braids,into,the,dignity,of,a,calico,dress,and,starched,white,turban,was,an,intoxicating,affair,<END>
she,would,never,have,arrived,at,this,eminence,so,early,in,life,had,not,the,exigencies,of,war,and,the,demands,of,the,commissary,department,on,tara,made,it,impossible,for,ellen,to,spare,mammy,or,dilcey,or,even,rosa,or,teena,<END>
prissy,had,never,been,more,than,a,mile,away,from,twelve,oaks,or,tara,before,and,the,trip,on,the,train,plus,her,elevation,to,nurse,was,almost,more,than,the,brain,in,her,little,black,skull,could,bear,<END>
the,twenty-mile,journey,from,jonesboro,to,atlanta,had,so,excited,her,that,scarlett,had,been,forced,to,hold,the,baby,all,the,way,<END>

when,uncle,peter,finally,maneuvered,the,carriage,out,of,the,mudholes,and,onto,peachtree,street,she,felt,the,first,surge,of,interest,she,had,known,in,months,<END>
how,the,town,had,grown,<END>
it,was,not,much,more,than,a,year,since,she,had,last,been,here,and,it,did,not,seem,possible,that,the,little,atlanta,she,knew,could,have,changed,so,much,<END>
for,the,past,year,she,had,been,so,engrossed,in,her,own,woes,so,bored,by,any,mention,of,war,she,did,not,know,that,from,the,minute,the,fighting,first,began,atlanta,had,been,transformed,<END>
the,same,railroads,which,had,made,the,town,the,crossroads,of,commerce,in,time,of,peace,were,now,of,vital,strategic,importance,in,time,of,war,<END>
far,from,the,battle,lines,the,town,and,its,railroads,provided,the,connecting,link,between,the,two,armies,of,the,confederacy,the,army,in,virginia,and,the,army,in,tennessee,and,the,west,<END>
and,atlanta,likewise,linked,both,of,the,armies,with,the,deeper,south,from,which,they,drew,their,supplies,<END>
now,in,response,to,the,needs,of,war,atlanta,had,become,a,manufacturing,center,a,hospital,base,and,one,of,the,south's,chief,depots,for,the,collecting,of,food,and,supplies,for,the,armies,in,the,field,<END>
scarlett,looked,about,her,for,the,little,town,she,remembered,so,well,<END>
it,was,gone,<END>
the,town,she,was,now,seeing,was,like,a,baby,grown,overnight,into,a,busy,sprawling,giant,<END>
atlanta,was,humming,like,a,beehive,proudly,conscious,of,its,importance,to,the,confederacy,and,work,was,going,forward,night,and,day,toward,turning,an,agricultural,section,into,an,industrial,one,<END>
before,the,war,there,had,been,few,cotton,factories,woolen,mills,arsenals,and,machine,shops,south,of,maryland,a,fact,of,which,all,southerners,were,proud,<END>
the,south,produced,statesmen,and,soldiers,planters,and,doctors,lawyers,and,poets,but,certainly,not,engineers,or,mechanics,<END>
let,the,yankees,adopt,such,low,callings,<END>
but,now,the,confederate,ports,were,stoppered,with,yankee,gunboats,only,a,trickle,of,blockade-run,goods,was,slipping,in,from,europe,and,the,south,was,desperately,trying,to,manufacture,her,own,war,materials,<END>
the,north,could,call,on,the,whole,world,for,supplies,and,for,soldiers,and,thousands,of,irish,and,germans,were,pouring,into,the,union,army,lured,by,the,bounty,money,offered,by,the,north,<END>
the,south,could,only,turn,in,upon,itself,<END>
in,atlanta,there,were,machine,factories,tediously,turning,out,machinery,to,manufacture,war,materials,tediously,because,there,were,few,machines,in,the,south,from,which,they,could,model,and,nearly,every,wheel,and,cog,had,to,be,made,from,drawings,that,came,through,the,blockade,from,england,<END>
there,were,strange,faces,on,the,streets,of,atlanta,now,and,citizens,who,a,year,ago,would,have,pricked,up,their,ears,at,the,sound,of,even,a,western,accent,paid,no,heed,to,the,foreign,tongues,of,europeans,who,had,run,the,blockade,to,build,machines,and,turn,out,confederate,munitions,<END>
skilled,men,these,without,whom,the,confederacy,would,have,been,hard,put,to,make,pistols,rifles,cannon,and,powder,<END>
almost,the,pulsing,of,the,town's,heart,could,be,felt,as,the,work,went,forward,night,and,day,pumping,the,materials,of,war,up,the,railway,arteries,to,the,two,battle,fronts,<END>
trains,roared,in,and,out,of,the,town,at,all,hours,<END>
soot,from,the,newly,erected,factories,fell,in,showers,on,the,white,houses,<END>
by,night,the,furnaces,glowed,and,the,hammers,clanged,long,after,townsfolk,were,abed,<END>
where,vacant,lots,had,been,a,year,before,there,were,now,factories,turning,out,harness,saddles,and,shoes,ordnance-supply,plants,making,rifles,and,cannon,rolling,mills,and,foundries,producing,iron,rails,and,freight,cars,to,replace,those,destroyed,by,the,yankees,and,a,variety,of,industries,manufacturing,spurs,bridle,bits,buckles,tents,buttons,pistols,and,swords,<END>
already,the,foundries,were,beginning,to,feel,the,lack,of,iron,for,little,or,none,came,through,the,blockade,and,the,mines,in,alabama,were,standing,almost,idle,while,the,miners,were,at,the,front,<END>
there,were,no,iron,picket,fences,iron,summerhouses,iron,gates,or,even,iron,statuary,on,the,lawns,of,atlanta,now,for,they,had,early,found,their,way,into,the,melting,pots,of,the,rolling,mills,<END>
here,along,peachtree,street,and,near-by,streets,were,the,headquarters,of,the,various,army,departments,each,office,swarming,with,uniformed,men,the,commissary,the,signal,corps,the,mail,service,the,railway,transport,the,provost,marshal,<END>

as,uncle,peter,told,her,about,them,scarlett,felt,that,atlanta,must,be,a,city,of,the,wounded,for,there,were,general,hospitals,contagious,hospitals,convalescent,hospitals,without,number,<END>
and,every,day,the,trains,just,below,five,points,disgorged,more,sick,and,more,wounded,<END>
the,little,town,was,gone,and,the,face,of,the,rapidly,growing,city,was,animated,with,never-ceasing,energy,and,bustle,<END>
the,sight,of,so,much,hurrying,made,scarlett,fresh,from,rural,leisure,and,quiet,almost,breathless,but,she,liked,it,<END>
there,was,an,exciting,atmosphere,about,the,place,that,uplifted,her,<END>
it,was,as,if,she,could,actually,feel,the,accelerated,steady,pulse,of,the,town's,heart,beating,in,time,with,her,own,<END>
as,they,slowly,made,their,way,through,the,mudholes,of,the,town's,chief,street,she,noted,with,interest,all,the,new,buildings,and,the,new,faces,<END>
the,sidewalks,were,crowded,with,men,in,uniform,bearing,the,insignia,of,all,ranks,and,all,service,branches,the,narrow,street,was,jammed,with,vehicles,carriages,buggies,ambulances,covered,army,wagons,with,profane,drivers,swearing,as,the,mules,struggled,through,the,ruts,gray-clad,couriers,dashed,spattering,through,the,streets,from,one,headquarters,to,another,bearing,orders,and,telegraphic,dispatches,convalescents,limped,about,on,crutches,usually,with,a,solicitous,lady,at,either,elbow,bugle,and,drum,and,barked,orders,sounded,from,the,drill,fields,where,the,recruits,were,being,turned,into,soldiers,and,with,her,heart,in,her,throat,scarlett,had,her,first,sight,of,yankee,uniforms,as,uncle,peter,pointed,with,his,whip,to,a,detachment,of,dejected-looking,bluecoats,being,shepherded,toward,the,depot,by,a,squad,of,confederates,with,fixed,bayonets,to,entrain,for,the,prison,camp,<END>

the,carriage,plowed,its,way,farther,and,halted,for,a,moment,to,permit,two,ladies,with,baskets,of,bandages,on,their,arms,to,pick,precarious,passages,across,the,sloppy,street,on,stepping,stones,<END>
at,the,same,moment,scarlett's,eye,was,caught,by,a,figure,on,the,sidewalk,in,a,brightly,colored,dress,too,bright,for,street,wear,covered,by,a,paisley,shawl,with,fringes,to,the,heels,<END>
turning,she,saw,a,tall,handsome,woman,with,a,bold,face,and,a,mass,of,red,hair,too,red,to,be,true,<END>
it,was,the,first,time,she,had,ever,seen,any,woman,who,she,knew,for,certain,had,done,something,to,her,hair,and,she,watched,her,fascinated,<END>
uncle,peter,who,is,that,<END>
she,whispered,<END>
ah,doan,know,<END>

who,is,she,<END>
her,name,belle,watling,said,uncle,peter,his,lower,lip,beginning,to,protrude,<END>
scarlett,was,quick,to,catch,the,fact,that,he,had,not,preceded,the,name,with,miss,or,mrs,<END>
who,is,she,<END>
miss,scarlett,said,peter,darkly,laying,the,whip,on,the,startled,horse,miss,pitty,ain',gwine,ter,lak,it,you,astin',questions,dat,ain',none,of,yo',bizness,<END>

thought,scarlett,reproved,into,silence,<END>
that,must,be,a,bad,woman,<END>
she,had,never,seen,a,bad,woman,before,and,she,twisted,her,head,and,stared,after,her,until,she,was,lost,in,the,crowd,<END>
the,stores,and,the,new,war,buildings,were,farther,apart,now,with,vacant,lots,between,<END>
finally,the,business,section,fell,behind,and,the,residences,came,into,view,<END>
scarlett,picked,them,out,as,old,friends,the,leyden,house,dignified,and,stately,the,bonnells',with,little,white,columns,and,green,blinds,the,close-lipped,red-,brick,georgian,home,of,the,mclure,family,behind,its,low,box,hedges,<END>
their,progress,was,slower,now,for,from,porches,and,gardens,and,sidewalks,ladies,called,to,her,<END>
some,she,knew,slightly,others,she,vaguely,remembered,but,most,of,them,she,knew,not,at,all,<END>
pittypat,had,certainly,broadcast,her,arrival,<END>
little,wade,had,to,be,held,up,time,and,again,so,that,ladies,who,ventured,as,far,through,the,ooze,as,their,carriage,blocks,could,exclaim,over,him,<END>
they,all,cried,to,her,that,she,must,join,their,knitting,and,sewing,circles,and,their,hospital,committees,and,no,one,else's,and,she,promised,recklessly,to,right,and,left,<END>
as,they,passed,a,rambling,green,clapboard,house,a,little,black,girl,posted,on,the,front,steps,cried,hyah,she,come,and,dr,meade,and,his,wife,and,little,thirteen-year-old,phil,emerged,calling,greetings,<END>
scarlett,recalled,that,they,too,had,been,at,her,wedding,<END>
mrs,meade,mounted,her,carriage,block,and,craned,her,neck,for,a,view,of,the,baby,but,the,doctor,disregarding,the,mud,plowed,through,to,the,side,of,the,carriage,<END>
he,was,tall,and,gaunt,and,wore,a,pointed,beard,of,iron,gray,and,his,clothes,hung,on,his,spare,figure,as,though,blown,there,by,a,hurricane,<END>
atlanta,considered,him,the,root,of,all,strength,and,all,wisdom,and,it,was,not,strange,that,he,had,absorbed,something,of,their,belief,<END>
but,for,all,his,habit,of,making,oracular,statements,and,his,slightly,pompous,manner,he,was,as,kindly,a,man,as,the,town,possessed,<END>
after,shaking,her,hand,and,prodding,wade,in,the,stomach,and,complimenting,him,the,doctor,announced,that,aunt,pittypat,had,promised,on,oath,that,scarlett,should,be,on,no,other,hospital,and,bandage-rolling,committee,save,mrs,meade's,<END>
oh,dear,but,i've,promised,a,thousand,ladies,already,<END>
said,scarlett,<END>
mrs,merriwether,i'll,be,bound,<END>
cried,mrs,meade,indignantly,<END>
drat,the,woman,<END>
i,believe,she,meets,every,train,<END>
i,promised,because,i,hadn't,a,notion,what,it,was,all,about,scarlett,confessed,<END>
what,are,hospital,committees,anyway,<END>
both,the,doctor,and,his,wife,looked,slightly,shocked,at,her,ignorance,<END>
but,of,course,you've,been,buried,in,the,country,and,couldn't,know,mrs,meade,apologized,for,her,<END>
we,have,nursing,committees,for,different,hospitals,and,for,different,days,<END>
we,nurse,the,men,and,help,the,doctors,and,make,bandages,and,clothes,and,when,the,men,are,well,enough,to,leave,the,hospitals,we,take,them,into,our,homes,to,convalesce,till,they,are,able,to,go,back,in,the,army,<END>
and,we,look,after,the,wives,and,families,of,some,of,the,wounded,who,are,destitute,yes,worse,than,destitute,<END>
dr,meade,is,at,the,institute,hospital,where,my,committee,works,and,everyone,says,he's,marvelous,and,<END>
there,there,mrs,meade,said,the,doctor,fondly,<END>
don't,go,bragging,on,me,in,front,of,folks,<END>
it's,little,enough,i,can,do,since,you,wouldn't,let,me,go,in,the,army,<END>
'wouldn't,let,',<END>
she,cried,indignantly,<END>
me,<END>
the,town,wouldn't,let,you,and,you,know,it,<END>
why,scarlett,when,folks,heard,he,was,intending,to,go,to,virginia,as,an,army,surgeon,all,the,ladies,signed,a,petition,begging,him,to,stay,here,<END>
of,course,the,town,couldn't,do,without,you,<END>
there,there,mrs,meade,said,the,doctor,basking,obviously,in,the,praise,<END>
perhaps,with,one,boy,at,the,front,that's,enough,for,the,time,being,<END>
and,i'm,going,next,year,<END>
cried,little,phil,hopping,about,excitedly,<END>
as,a,drummer,boy,<END>
i'm,learning,how,to,drum,now,<END>
do,you,want,to,hear,me,<END>
i'll,run,get,my,drum,<END>
no,not,now,said,mrs,meade,drawing,him,closer,to,her,a,sudden,look,of,strain,coming,over,her,face,<END>
not,next,year,darling,<END>
maybe,the,year,after,<END>
but,the,war,will,be,over,then,<END>
he,cried,petulantly,pulling,away,from,her,<END>
and,you,promised,<END>
over,his,head,the,eyes,of,the,parents,met,and,scarlett,saw,the,look,<END>
darcy,meade,was,in,virginia,and,they,were,clinging,closer,to,the,little,boy,that,was,left,<END>
uncle,peter,cleared,his,throat,<END>

and,you,tell,pitty,for,me,that,if,you,aren't,on,my,committee,she's,going,to,be,in,a,worse,state,<END>
the,carriage,slipped,and,slid,down,the,muddy,road,and,scarlett,leaned,back,on,the,cushions,and,smiled,<END>
she,felt,better,now,than,she,had,felt,in,months,<END>
atlanta,with,its,crowds,and,its,hurry,and,its,undercurrent,of,driving,excitement,was,very,pleasant,very,exhilarating,so,very,much,nicer,than,the,lonely,plantation,out,from,charleston,where,the,bellow,of,alligators,broke,the,night,stillness,better,than,charleston,itself,dreaming,in,its,gardens,behind,its,high,walls,better,than,savannah,with,its,wide,streets,lined,with,palmetto,and,the,muddy,river,beside,it,<END>
yes,and,temporarily,even,better,than,tara,dear,though,tara,was,<END>
there,was,something,exciting,about,this,town,with,its,narrow,muddy,streets,lying,among,rolling,red,hills,something,raw,and,crude,that,appealed,to,the,rawness,and,crudeness,underlying,the,fine,veneer,that,ellen,and,mammy,had,given,her,<END>
she,suddenly,felt,that,this,was,where,she,belonged,not,in,serene,and,quiet,old,cities,flat,beside,yellow,waters,<END>
the,houses,were,farther,and,farther,apart,now,and,leaning,out,scarlett,saw,the,red,brick,and,slate,roof,of,miss,pittypat's,house,<END>
it,was,almost,the,last,house,on,the,north,side,of,town,<END>
beyond,it,peachtree,road,narrowed,and,twisted,under,great,trees,out,of,sight,into,thick,quiet,woods,<END>
the,neat,wooden-paneled,fence,had,been,newly,painted,white,and,the,front,yard,it,inclosed,was,yellow,starred,with,the,last,jonquils,of,the,season,<END>
on,the,front,steps,stood,two,women,in,black,and,behind,them,a,large,yellow,woman,with,her,hands,under,her,apron,and,her,white,teeth,showing,in,a,wide,smile,<END>
plump,miss,pittypat,was,teetering,excitedly,on,tiny,feet,one,hand,pressed,to,her,copious,bosom,to,still,her,fluttering,heart,<END>
scarlett,saw,melanie,standing,by,her,and,with,a,surge,of,dislike,she,realized,that,the,fly,in,the,ointment,of,atlanta,would,be,this,slight,little,person,in,black,mourning,dress,her,riotous,dark,curls,subdued,to,matronly,smoothness,and,a,loving,smile,of,welcome,and,happiness,on,her,heart-shaped,face,<END>
when,a,southerner,took,the,trouble,to,pack,a,trunk,and,travel,twenty,miles,for,a,visit,the,visit,was,seldom,of,shorter,duration,than,a,month,usually,much,longer,<END>
southerners,were,as,enthusiastic,visitors,as,they,were,hosts,and,there,was,nothing,unusual,in,relatives,coming,to,spend,the,christmas,holidays,and,remaining,until,july,<END>
often,when,newly,married,couples,went,on,the,usual,round,of,honeymoon,visits,they,lingered,in,some,pleasant,home,until,the,birth,of,their,second,child,<END>
frequently,elderly,aunts,and,uncles,came,to,sunday,dinner,and,remained,until,they,were,buried,years,later,<END>
visitors,presented,no,problem,for,houses,were,large,servants,numerous,and,the,feeding,of,several,extra,mouths,a,minor,matter,in,that,land,of,plenty,<END>
all,ages,and,sexes,went,visiting,honeymooners,young,mothers,showing,off,new,babies,convalescents,the,bereaved,girls,whose,parents,were,anxious,to,remove,them,from,the,dangers,of,unwise,matches,girls,who,had,reached,the,danger,age,without,becoming,engaged,and,who,it,was,hoped,would,make,suitable,matches,under,the,guidance,of,relatives,in,other,places,<END>
visitors,added,excitement,and,variety,to,the,slow-moving,southern,life,and,they,were,always,welcome,<END>
so,scarlett,had,come,to,atlanta,with,no,idea,as,to,how,long,she,would,remain,<END>
if,her,visit,proved,as,dull,as,those,in,savannah,and,charleston,she,would,return,home,in,a,month,<END>
if,her,stay,was,pleasant,she,would,remain,indefinitely,<END>
but,no,sooner,had,she,arrived,than,aunt,pitty,and,melanie,began,a,campaign,to,induce,her,to,make,her,home,permanently,with,them,<END>
they,brought,up,every,possible,argument,<END>
they,wanted,her,for,her,own,self,because,they,loved,her,<END>
they,were,lonely,and,often,frightened,at,night,in,the,big,house,and,she,was,so,brave,she,gave,them,courage,<END>
she,was,so,charming,that,she,cheered,them,in,their,sorrow,<END>
now,that,charles,was,dead,her,place,and,her,son's,place,were,with,his,kindred,<END>
besides,half,the,house,now,belonged,to,her,through,charles',will,<END>
last,the,confederacy,needed,every,pair,of,hands,for,sewing,knitting,bandage,rolling,and,nursing,the,wounded,<END>
charles',uncle,henry,hamilton,who,lived,in,bachelor,state,at,the,atlanta,hotel,near,the,depot,also,talked,seriously,to,her,on,this,subject,<END>
uncle,henry,was,a,short,pot-bellied,irascible,old,gentleman,with,a,pink,face,a,shock,of,long,silver,hair,and,an,utter,lack,of,patience,with,feminine,timidities,and,vaporings,<END>
it,was,for,the,latter,reason,that,he,was,barely,on,speaking,terms,with,his,sister,miss,pittypat,<END>
from,childhood,they,had,been,exact,opposites,in,temperament,and,they,had,been,further,estranged,by,his,objections,to,the,manner,in,which,she,had,reared,charles,making,a,damn,sissy,out,of,a,soldier's,son,<END>
years,before,he,had,so,insulted,her,that,now,miss,pitty,never,spoke,of,him,except,in,guarded,whispers,and,with,so,great,reticence,that,a,stranger,would,have,thought,the,honest,old,lawyer,a,murderer,at,the,least,<END>
the,insult,had,occurred,on,a,day,when,pitty,wished,to,draw,five,hundred,dollars,from,her,estate,of,which,he,was,trustee,to,invest,in,a,non-existent,gold,mine,<END>
he,had,refused,to,permit,it,and,stated,heatedly,that,she,had,no,more,sense,than,a,june,bug,and,furthermore,it,gave,him,the,fidgets,to,be,around,her,longer,than,five,minutes,<END>
since,that,day,she,only,saw,him,formally,once,a,month,when,uncle,peter,drove,her,to,his,office,to,get,the,housekeeping,money,<END>
after,these,brief,visits,pitty,always,took,to,her,bed,for,the,rest,of,the,day,with,tears,and,smelling,salts,<END>
melanie,and,charles,who,were,on,excellent,terms,with,their,uncle,had,frequently,offered,to,relieve,her,of,this,ordeal,but,pitty,always,set,her,babyish,mouth,firmly,and,refused,<END>
henry,was,her,cross,and,she,must,bear,him,<END>
from,this,charles,and,melanie,could,only,infer,that,she,took,a,profound,pleasure,in,this,occasional,excitement,the,only,excitement,in,her,sheltered,life,<END>
uncle,henry,liked,scarlett,immediately,because,he,said,he,could,see,that,for,all,her,silly,affectations,she,had,a,few,grains,of,sense,<END>
he,was,trustee,not,only,of,pitty's,and,melanie's,estates,but,also,of,that,left,scarlett,by,charles,<END>
it,came,to,scarlett,as,a,pleasant,surprise,that,she,was,now,a,well-to-do,young,woman,for,charles,had,not,only,left,her,half,of,aunt,pitty's,house,but,farm,lands,and,town,property,as,well,<END>
and,the,stores,and,warehouses,along,the,railroad,track,near,the,depot,which,were,part,of,her,inheritance,had,tripled,in,value,since,the,war,began,<END>
it,was,when,uncle,henry,was,giving,her,an,account,of,her,property,that,he,broached,the,matter,of,her,permanent,residence,in,atlanta,<END>
when,wade,hampton,comes,of,age,he's,going,to,be,a,rich,young,man,he,said,<END>
the,way,atlanta,is,growing,his,property,will,be,ten,times,more,valuable,in,twenty,years,and,it's,only,right,that,the,boy,should,be,raised,where,his,property,is,so,he,can,learn,to,take,care,of,it,yes,and,of,pitty's,and,melanie's,too,<END>
he'll,be,the,only,man,of,the,hamilton,name,left,before,long,for,i,won't,be,here,forever,<END>
as,for,uncle,peter,he,took,it,for,granted,that,scarlett,had,come,to,stay,<END>
it,was,inconceivable,to,him,that,charles',only,son,should,be,reared,where,he,could,not,supervise,the,rearing,<END>
to,all,these,arguments,scarlett,smiled,but,said,nothing,unwilling,to,commit,herself,before,learning,how,she,would,like,atlanta,and,constant,association,with,her,in-laws,<END>
she,knew,too,that,gerald,and,ellen,would,have,to,be,won,over,<END>
moreover,now,that,she,was,away,from,tara,she,missed,it,dreadfully,missed,the,red,fields,and,the,springing,green,cotton,and,the,sweet,twilight,silences,<END>
for,the,first,time,she,realized,dimly,what,gerald,had,meant,when,he,said,that,the,love,of,the,land,was,in,her,blood,<END>
so,she,gracefully,evaded,for,the,time,being,a,definite,answer,as,to,the,duration,of,her,visit,and,slipped,easily,into,the,life,of,the,red-brick,house,at,the,quiet,end,of,peachtree,street,<END>
living,with,charles',blood,kin,seeing,the,home,from,which,he,came,<END>
scarlett,could,now,understand,a,little,better,the,boy,who,had,made,her,wife,widow,and,mother,in,such,rapid,succession,<END>
it,was,easy,to,see,why,he,had,been,so,shy,so,unsophisticated,so,idealistic,<END>
if,charles,had,inherited,any,of,the,qualities,of,the,stern,fearless,hot-tempered,soldier,who,had,been,his,father,they,had,been,obliterated,in,childhood,by,the,ladylike,atmosphere,in,which,he,had,been,reared,<END>
he,had,been,devoted,to,the,childlike,pitty,and,closer,than,brothers,usually,are,to,melanie,and,two,more,sweet,unworldly,women,could,not,be,found,<END>
aunt,pittypat,had,been,christened,sarah,jane,hamilton,sixty,years,before,but,since,the,long-past,day,when,her,doting,father,had,fastened,his,nickname,upon,her,because,of,her,airy,restless,pattering,little,feet,no,one,had,called,her,anything,else,<END>
in,the,years,that,followed,that,second,christening,many,changes,had,taken,place,in,her,that,made,the,pet,name,incongruous,<END>
of,the,swiftly,scampering,child,all,that,now,remained,were,two,tiny,feet,inadequate,to,her,weight,and,a,tendency,to,prattle,happily,and,aimlessly,<END>
she,was,stout,pink-cheeked,and,silver-haired,and,always,a,little,breathless,from,too,tightly,laced,stays,<END>
she,was,unable,to,walk,more,than,a,block,on,the,tiny,feet,which,she,crammed,into,too,small,slippers,<END>
she,had,a,heart,which,fluttered,at,any,excitement,and,she,pampered,it,shamelessly,fainting,at,any,provocation,<END>
everyone,knew,that,her,swoons,were,generally,mere,ladylike,pretenses,but,they,loved,her,enough,to,refrain,from,saying,so,<END>
everyone,loved,her,spoiled,her,like,a,child,and,refused,to,take,her,seriously,everyone,except,her,brother,henry,<END>
she,liked,gossip,better,than,anything,else,in,the,world,even,more,than,she,liked,the,pleasures,of,the,table,and,she,prattled,on,for,hours,about,other,people's,affairs,in,a,harmless,kindly,way,<END>
she,had,no,memory,for,names,dates,or,places,and,frequently,confused,the,actors,in,one,atlanta,drama,with,the,actors,in,another,which,misled,no,one,for,no,one,was,foolish,enough,to,take,seriously,anything,she,said,<END>
no,one,ever,told,her,anything,really,shocking,or,scandalous,for,her,spinster,state,must,be,protected,even,if,she,was,sixty,years,old,and,her,friends,were,in,a,kindly,conspiracy,to,keep,her,a,sheltered,and,petted,old,child,<END>
melanie,was,like,her,aunt,in,many,ways,<END>
she,had,her,shyness,her,sudden,blushes,her,modesty,but,she,did,have,common,sense,of,a,sort,i'll,admit,that,scarlett,thought,grudgingly,<END>
like,aunt,pitty,melanie,had,the,face,of,a,sheltered,child,who,had,never,known,anything,but,simplicity,and,kindness,truth,and,love,a,child,who,had,never,looked,upon,harshness,or,evil,and,would,not,recognize,them,if,she,saw,them,<END>
because,she,had,always,been,happy,she,wanted,everyone,about,her,to,be,happy,or,at,least,pleased,with,themselves,<END>
to,this,end,she,always,saw,the,best,in,everyone,and,remarked,kindly,upon,it,<END>
there,was,no,servant,so,stupid,that,she,did,not,find,some,redeeming,trait,of,loyalty,and,kind-heartedness,no,girl,so,ugly,and,disagreeable,that,she,could,not,discover,grace,of,form,or,nobility,of,character,in,her,and,no,man,so,worthless,or,so,boring,that,she,did,not,view,him,in,the,light,of,his,possibilities,rather,than,his,actualities,<END>
because,of,these,qualities,that,came,sincerely,and,spontaneously,from,a,generous,heart,everyone,flocked,about,her,for,who,can,resist,the,charm,of,one,who,discovers,in,others,admirable,qualities,undreamed,of,even,by,himself,<END>
she,had,more,girl,friends,than,anyone,in,town,and,more,men,friends,too,though,she,had,few,beaux,for,she,lacked,the,willfulness,and,selfishness,that,go,far,toward,trapping,men's,hearts,<END>
what,melanie,did,was,no,more,than,all,southern,girls,were,taught,to,do,to,make,those,about,them,feel,at,ease,and,pleased,with,themselves,<END>
it,was,this,happy,feminine,conspiracy,which,made,southern,society,so,pleasant,<END>
women,knew,that,a,land,where,men,were,contented,uncontradicted,and,safe,in,possession,of,unpunctured,vanity,was,likely,to,be,a,very,pleasant,place,for,women,to,live,<END>
so,from,the,cradle,to,the,grave,women,strove,to,make,men,pleased,with,themselves,and,the,satisfied,men,repaid,lavishly,with,gallantry,and,adoration,<END>
in,fact,men,willingly,gave,the,ladies,everything,in,the,world,except,credit,for,having,intelligence,<END>
scarlett,exercised,the,same,charms,as,melanie,but,with,a,studied,artistry,and,consummate,skill,<END>
the,difference,between,the,two,girls,lay,in,the,fact,that,melanie,spoke,kind,and,flattering,words,from,a,desire,to,make,people,happy,if,only,temporarily,and,scarlett,never,did,it,except,to,further,her,own,aims,<END>
from,the,two,he,loved,best,charles,had,received,no,toughening,influences,learned,nothing,of,harshness,or,reality,and,the,home,in,which,he,grew,to,manhood,was,as,soft,as,a,bird's,nest,<END>
it,was,such,a,quiet,old-fashioned,gentle,home,compared,with,tara,<END>
to,scarlett,this,house,cried,out,for,the,masculine,smells,of,brandy,tobacco,and,macassar,oil,for,hoarse,voices,and,occasional,curses,for,guns,for,whiskers,for,saddles,and,bridles,and,for,hounds,underfoot,<END>

here,excitement,never,entered,in,voices,were,never,raised,everyone,deferred,gently,to,the,opinions,of,others,and,in,the,end,the,black,grizzled,autocrat,in,the,kitchen,had,his,way,<END>
scarlett,who,had,hoped,for,a,freer,rein,when,she,escaped,mammy's,supervision,discovered,to,her,sorrow,that,uncle,peter's,standards,of,ladylike,conduct,especially,for,mist',charles',widow,were,even,stricter,than,mammy's,<END>
in,such,a,household,scarlett,came,back,to,herself,and,almost,before,she,realized,it,her,spirits,rose,to,normal,<END>
she,was,only,seventeen,she,had,superb,health,and,energy,and,charles',people,did,their,best,to,make,her,happy,<END>
if,they,fell,a,little,short,of,this,it,was,not,their,fault,for,no,one,could,take,out,of,her,heart,the,ache,that,throbbed,whenever,ashley's,name,was,mentioned,<END>
and,melanie,mentioned,it,so,often,<END>
but,melanie,and,pitty,were,tireless,in,planning,ways,to,soothe,the,sorrow,under,which,they,thought,she,labored,<END>
they,put,their,own,grief,into,the,background,in,order,to,divert,her,<END>
they,fussed,about,her,food,and,her,hours,for,taking,afternoon,naps,and,for,taking,carriage,rides,<END>
they,not,only,admired,her,extravagantly,her,high-spiritedness,her,figure,her,tiny,hands,and,feet,her,white,skin,but,they,said,so,frequently,petting,hugging,and,kissing,her,to,emphasize,their,loving,words,<END>
scarlett,did,not,care,for,the,caresses,but,she,basked,in,the,compliments,<END>
no,one,at,tara,had,ever,said,so,many,charming,things,about,her,<END>
in,fact,mammy,had,spent,her,time,deflating,her,conceit,<END>
little,wade,was,no,longer,an,annoyance,for,the,family,black,and,white,and,the,neighbors,idolized,him,and,there,was,a,never-ceasing,rivalry,as,to,whose,lap,he,should,occupy,<END>
melanie,especially,doted,on,him,<END>
even,in,his,worst,screaming,spells,melanie,thought,him,adorable,and,said,so,adding,oh,you,precious,darling,<END>
i,just,wish,you,were,mine,<END>
sometimes,scarlett,found,it,hard,to,dissemble,her,feelings,for,she,still,thought,aunt,pitty,the,silliest,of,old,ladies,and,her,vagueness,and,vaporings,irritated,her,unendurably,<END>
she,disliked,melanie,with,a,jealous,dislike,that,grew,as,the,days,went,by,and,sometimes,she,had,to,leave,the,room,abruptly,when,melanie,beaming,with,loving,pride,spoke,of,ashley,or,read,his,letters,aloud,<END>
but,all,in,all,life,went,on,as,happily,as,was,possible,under,the,circumstances,<END>
atlanta,was,more,interesting,than,savannah,or,charleston,or,tara,and,it,offered,so,many,strange,war-time,occupations,she,had,little,time,to,think,or,mope,<END>
but,sometimes,when,she,blew,out,the,candle,and,burrowed,her,head,into,the,pillow,she,sighed,and,thought,if,only,ashley,wasn't,married,<END>
if,only,i,didn't,have,to,nurse,in,that,plagued,hospital,<END>
oh,if,only,i,could,have,some,beaux,<END>
she,had,immediately,loathed,nursing,but,she,could,not,escape,this,duty,because,she,was,on,both,mrs,meade's,and,mrs,merriwether's,committees,<END>
that,meant,four,mornings,a,week,in,the,sweltering,stinking,hospital,with,her,hair,tied,up,in,a,towel,and,a,hot,apron,covering,her,from,neck,to,feet,<END>
every,matron,old,or,young,in,atlanta,nursed,and,did,it,with,an,enthusiasm,that,seemed,to,scarlett,little,short,of,fanatic,<END>
they,took,it,for,granted,that,she,was,imbued,with,their,own,patriotic,fervor,and,would,have,been,shocked,to,know,how,slight,an,interest,in,the,war,she,had,<END>
except,for,the,ever-present,torment,that,ashley,might,be,killed,the,war,interested,her,not,at,all,and,nursing,was,something,she,did,simply,because,she,didn't,know,how,to,get,out,of,it,<END>
certainly,there,was,nothing,romantic,about,nursing,<END>
to,her,it,meant,groans,delirium,death,and,smells,<END>
the,hospitals,were,filled,with,dirty,bewhiskered,verminous,men,who,smelled,terribly,and,bore,on,their,bodies,wounds,hideous,enough,to,turn,a,christian's,stomach,<END>
the,hospitals,stank,of,gangrene,the,odor,assaulting,her,nostrils,long,before,the,doors,were,reached,a,sickish,sweet,smell,that,clung,to,her,hands,and,hair,and,haunted,her,in,her,dreams,<END>
flies,mosquitoes,and,gnats,hovered,in,droning,singing,swarms,over,the,wards,tormenting,the,men,to,curses,and,weak,sobs,and,scarlett,scratching,her,own,mosquito,bites,swung,palmetto,fans,until,her,shoulders,ached,and,she,wished,that,all,the,men,were,dead,<END>
melanie,however,did,not,seem,to,mind,the,smells,the,wounds,or,the,nakedness,which,scarlett,thought,strange,in,one,who,was,the,most,timorous,and,modest,of,women,<END>
sometimes,when,holding,basins,and,instruments,while,dr,meade,cut,out,gangrened,flesh,melanie,looked,very,white,<END>
and,once,alter,such,an,operation,scarlett,found,her,in,the,linen,closet,vomiting,quietly,into,a,towel,<END>
but,as,long,as,she,was,where,the,wounded,could,see,her,she,was,gentle,sympathetic,and,cheerful,and,the,men,in,the,hospitals,called,her,an,angel,of,mercy,<END>
scarlett,would,have,liked,that,title,too,but,it,involved,touching,men,crawling,with,lice,running,fingers,down,throats,of,unconscious,patients,to,see,if,they,were,choking,on,swallowed,tobacco,quids,bandaging,stumps,and,picking,maggots,out,of,festering,flesh,<END>
no,she,did,not,like,nursing,<END>
perhaps,it,might,have,been,endurable,if,she,had,been,permitted,to,use,her,charms,on,the,convalescent,men,for,many,of,them,were,attractive,and,well,born,but,this,she,could,not,do,in,her,widowed,state,<END>
the,young,ladies,of,the,town,who,were,not,permitted,to,nurse,for,fear,they,would,see,sights,unfit,for,virgin,eyes,had,the,convalescent,wards,in,their,charge,<END>
unhampered,by,matrimony,or,widowhood,they,made,vast,inroads,on,the,convalescents,and,even,the,least,attractive,girls,scarlett,observed,gloomily,had,no,difficulty,in,getting,engaged,<END>
with,the,exception,of,desperately,ill,and,severely,wounded,men,scarlett's,was,a,completely,feminized,world,and,this,irked,her,for,she,neither,liked,nor,trusted,her,own,sex,and,worse,still,was,always,bored,by,it,<END>
but,on,three,afternoons,a,week,she,had,to,attend,sewing,circles,and,bandage-rolling,committees,of,melanie's,friends,<END>
the,girls,who,had,all,known,charles,were,very,kind,and,attentive,to,her,at,these,gatherings,especially,fanny,elsing,and,maybelle,merriwether,the,daughters,of,the,town,dowagers,<END>
but,they,treated,her,deferentially,as,if,she,were,old,and,finished,and,their,constant,chatter,of,dances,and,beaux,made,her,both,envious,of,their,pleasures,and,resentful,that,her,widowhood,barred,her,from,such,activities,<END>
why,she,was,three,times,as,attractive,as,fanny,and,maybelle,<END>
oh,how,unfair,life,was,<END>
how,unfair,that,everyone,should,think,her,heart,was,in,the,grave,when,it,wasn't,at,all,<END>
it,was,in,virginia,with,ashley,<END>

and,her,visit,lengthened,as,the,weeks,slipped,by,<END>
chapter,ix,<END>
scarlett,sat,in,the,window,of,her,bedroom,that,midsummer,morning,and,disconsolately,watched,the,wagons,and,carriages,full,of,girls,soldiers,and,chaperons,ride,gaily,out,peachtree,road,in,search,of,woodland,decorations,for,the,bazaar,which,was,to,be,held,that,evening,for,the,benefit,of,the,hospitals,<END>

behind,them,streamed,the,merry,cavalcade,girls,cool,in,flowered,cotton,dresses,with,light,shawls,bonnets,and,mitts,to,protect,their,skins,and,little,parasols,held,over,their,heads,elderly,ladies,placid,and,smiling,amid,the,laughter,and,carriage-,to-carriage,calls,and,jokes,convalescents,from,the,hospitals,wedged,in,between,stout,chaperons,and,slender,girls,who,made,great,fuss,and,to-do,over,them,officers,on,horseback,idling,at,snail's,pace,beside,the,carriages,wheels,creaking,spurs,jingling,gold,braid,gleaming,parasols,bobbing,fans,swishing,negroes,singing,<END>
everybody,was,riding,out,peachtree,road,to,gather,greenery,and,have,a,picnic,and,melon,cutting,<END>
everybody,thought,scarlett,morosely,except,me,<END>
they,all,waved,and,called,to,her,as,they,went,by,and,she,tried,to,respond,with,a,good,grace,but,it,was,difficult,<END>
a,hard,little,pain,had,started,in,her,heart,and,was,traveling,slowly,up,toward,her,throat,where,it,would,become,a,lump,and,the,lump,would,soon,become,tears,<END>

yesterday,she,had,worked,until,she,was,worn,out,in,the,dusty,old,barn,of,an,armory,draping,yellow,and,pink,and,green,cheesecloth,on,the,booths,that,lined,the,walls,<END>
under,the,supervision,of,the,ladies',hospital,committee,this,was,plain,hard,work,and,no,fun,at,all,<END>

her,bowing,and,waving,were,abruptly,halted,when,pittypat,entered,the,room,panting,as,usual,from,climbing,the,stairs,and,jerked,her,away,from,the,window,unceremoniously,<END>

long,graceful,ropes,of,ivy,and,grapevine,and,smilax,were,hung,everywhere,in,looping,festoons,on,the,walls,draped,above,the,windows,twined,in,scallops,all,over,the,brightly,colored,cheesecloth,booths,<END>

a,bugle,blared,and,a,bass,voice,shouted,the,command,to,break,ranks,<END>
in,a,moment,the,home,guard,and,the,militia,unit,in,their,bright,uniforms,shook,the,narrow,stairs,and,crowded,into,the,room,bowing,saluting,shaking,hands,<END>

in,the,militia,there,were,many,middle-aged,men,and,some,older,men,but,there,was,a,fair,sprinkling,of,men,of,military,age,who,did,not,carry,themselves,quite,so,jauntily,as,their,elders,or,their,juniors,<END>
already,people,were,beginning,to,whisper,asking,why,they,were,not,with,lee,<END>

it,had,seemed,such,a,large,place,a,few,minutes,before,and,now,it,was,packed,warm,with,summer-night,odors,of,sachet,and,cologne,water,and,hair,pomade,and,burning,bayberry,candles,fragrant,with,flowers,faintly,dusty,as,many,feet,trod,the,old,drill,floors,<END>

stonewall,jackson's,triumphs,in,the,valley,and,the,defeat,of,the,yankees,in,the,seven,days',battle,around,richmond,showed,that,clearly,<END>

of,course,there,were,empty,chairs,and,babies,who,would,never,see,their,fathers',faces,and,unmarked,graves,by,lonely,virginia,creeks,and,in,the,still,mountains,of,tennessee,but,was,that,too,great,a,price,to,pay,for,such,a,cause,<END>
silks,for,the,ladies,and,tea,and,sugar,were,hard,to,get,but,that,was,something,to,joke,about,<END>
besides,the,dashing,blockade,runners,were,bringing,in,these,very,things,under,the,yankees',disgruntled,noses,and,that,made,the,possession,of,them,many,times,more,thrilling,<END>
soon,raphael,semmes,and,the,confederate,navy,would,tend,to,those,yankee,gunboats,and,the,ports,would,be,wide,open,<END>

in,a,sudden,flash,of,self-knowledge,that,made,her,mouth,pop,open,with,astonishment,she,realized,that,she,did,not,share,with,these,women,their,fierce,pride,their,desire,to,sacrifice,themselves,and,everything,they,had,for,the,cause,<END>

the,cause,didn't,seem,sacred,to,her,<END>
the,war,didn't,seem,to,be,a,holy,affair,but,a,nuisance,that,killed,men,senselessly,and,cost,money,and,made,luxuries,hard,to,get,<END>

tired,and,bored,and,nauseated,with,the,sickening,gangrene,smells,and,the,endless,moaning,frightened,by,the,look,that,coming,death,gave,to,sunken,faces,<END>
she,looked,furtively,around,her,as,the,treacherous,blasphemous,thoughts,rushed,through,her,mind,fearful,that,someone,might,find,them,written,clearly,upon,her,face,<END>

they,were,whole,hearted,and,sincere,in,their,devotion,to,the,cause,<END>

her,waist,is,as,big,as,a,cow's,<END>

how,short,was,the,time,for,fun,for,pretty,clothes,for,dancing,for,coquetting,<END>
only,a,few,too,few,years,<END>
then,you,married,and,wore,dull-colored,dresses,and,had,babies,that,ruined,your,waist,line,and,sat,in,corners,at,dances,with,other,sober,matrons,and,only,emerged,to,dance,with,your,husband,or,with,old,gentlemen,who,stepped,on,your,feet,<END>

with,young,girls,and,young,married,women,you,slopped,over,with,sugar,and,kissed,them,every,time,you,met,them,even,if,it,was,ten,times,a,day,<END>

you,could,promise,with,your,eyes,any,number,of,exciting,things,that,would,make,a,man,maneuver,to,get,you,alone,<END>

sometimes,but,not,often,you,did,let,him,kiss,you,<END>

then,you,cried,and,declared,you,didn't,know,what,had,come,over,you,and,that,he,couldn't,ever,respect,you,again,<END>
then,he,had,to,dry,your,eyes,and,usually,he,proposed,to,show,just,how,much,he,did,respect,you,<END>
and,then,there,were,oh,there,were,so,many,things,to,do,to,bachelors,and,she,knew,them,all,the,nuance,of,the,sidelong,glance,the,half-smile,behind,the,fan,the,swaying,of,the,hips,so,that,skirts,swung,like,a,bell,the,tears,the,laughter,the,flattery,the,sweet,sympathy,<END>

how,wonderful,it,would,be,never,to,marry,but,to,go,on,being,lovely,in,pale,green,dresses,and,forever,courted,by,handsome,men,<END>

no,after,all,it,was,better,to,marry,and,keep,your,self-respect,even,if,you,never,had,any,more,fun,<END>

why,had,she,been,such,an,idiot,as,to,marry,charles,of,all,people,and,have,her,life,end,at,sixteen,<END>
her,indignant,and,hopeless,reverie,was,broken,when,the,crowd,began,pushing,back,against,the,walls,the,ladies,carefully,holding,their,hoops,so,that,no,careless,contact,should,turn,them,up,against,their,bodies,and,show,more,pantalets,than,was,proper,<END>
scarlett,tiptoed,above,the,crowd,and,saw,the,captain,of,the,militia,mounting,the,orchestra,platform,<END>
he,shouted,orders,and,half,of,the,company,fell,into,line,<END>
for,a,few,minutes,they,went,through,a,brisk,drill,that,brought,perspiration,to,their,foreheads,and,cheers,and,applause,from,the,audience,<END>
scarlett,clapped,her,hands,dutifully,with,the,rest,and,as,the,soldiers,pushed,forward,toward,the,punch,and,lemonade,booths,after,they,were,dismissed,she,turned,to,melanie,feeling,that,she,had,better,begin,her,deception,about,the,cause,as,soon,as,possible,<END>
they,looked,fine,didn't,they,<END>
she,said,<END>
melanie,was,fussing,about,with,the,knitted,things,on,the,counter,<END>
most,of,them,would,look,a,lot,finer,in,gray,uniforms,and,in,virginia,she,said,and,she,did,not,trouble,to,lower,her,voice,<END>
several,of,the,proud,mothers,of,members,of,the,militia,were,standing,close,by,and,overheard,the,remark,<END>
mrs,guinan,turned,scarlet,and,then,white,for,her,twenty-five-year-old,willie,was,in,the,company,<END>
scarlett,was,aghast,at,such,words,coming,from,melly,of,all,people,<END>
why,melly,<END>
you,know,it's,true,scarlet,<END>
i,don't,mean,the,little,boys,and,the,old,gentlemen,<END>
but,a,lot,of,the,militia,are,perfectly,able,to,tote,a,rifle,and,that's,what,they,ought,to,be,doing,this,minute,<END>
but,but,began,scarlett,who,had,never,considered,the,matter,before,<END>
somebody's,got,to,stay,home,to,what,was,it,willie,guinan,had,told,her,by,way,of,excusing,his,presence,in,atlanta,<END>
somebody's,got,to,stay,home,to,protect,the,state,from,invasion,<END>
nobody's,invading,us,and,nobody's,going,to,said,melly,coolly,looking,toward,a,group,of,the,militia,<END>
and,the,best,way,to,keep,out,invaders,is,to,go,to,virginia,and,beat,the,yankees,there,<END>
and,as,for,all,this,talk,about,the,militia,staying,here,to,keep,the,darkies,from,rising,why,it's,the,silliest,thing,i,ever,heard,of,<END>
why,should,our,people,rise,<END>
it's,just,a,good,excuse,for,cowards,<END>
i'll,bet,we,could,lick,the,yankees,in,a,month,if,all,the,militia,of,all,the,states,went,to,virginia,<END>
so,there,<END>
why,melly,<END>
cried,scarlett,again,staring,<END>
melly's,soft,dark,eyes,were,flashing,angrily,<END>
my,husband,wasn't,afraid,to,go,and,neither,was,yours,<END>
and,i'd,rather,they'd,both,be,dead,than,here,at,home,oh,darling,i'm,sorry,<END>
how,thoughtless,and,cruel,of,me,<END>
she,stroked,scarlett's,arm,appealingly,and,scarlett,stared,at,her,<END>
but,it,was,not,of,dead,charles,she,was,thinking,<END>
it,was,of,ashley,<END>
suppose,he,too,were,to,die,<END>
she,turned,quickly,and,smiled,automatically,as,dr,meade,walked,up,to,their,booth,<END>
well,girls,he,greeted,them,it,was,nice,of,you,to,come,<END>
i,know,what,a,sacrifice,it,must,have,been,for,you,to,come,out,tonight,<END>
but,it's,all,for,the,cause,<END>
and,i'm,going,to,tell,you,a,secret,<END>
i've,a,surprise,way,for,making,some,more,money,tonight,for,the,hospital,but,i'm,afraid,some,of,the,ladies,are,going,to,be,shocked,about,it,<END>
he,stopped,and,chuckled,as,he,tugged,at,his,gray,goatee,<END>
oh,what,<END>
do,tell,<END>
on,second,thought,i,believe,i'll,keep,you,guessing,too,<END>
but,you,girls,must,stand,up,for,me,if,the,church,members,want,to,run,me,out,of,town,for,doing,it,<END>
however,it's,for,the,hospital,<END>
you'll,see,<END>
nothing,like,this,has,ever,been,done,before,<END>
he,went,off,pompously,toward,a,group,of,chaperons,in,one,corner,and,just,as,the,two,girls,had,turned,to,each,other,to,discuss,the,possibilities,of,the,secret,two,old,gentlemen,bore,down,on,the,booth,declaring,in,loud,voices,that,they,wanted,ten,miles,of,tatting,<END>
well,after,all,old,gentlemen,were,better,than,no,gentlemen,at,all,thought,scarlett,measuring,out,the,tatting,and,submitting,demurely,to,being,chucked,under,the,chin,<END>
the,old,blades,charged,off,toward,the,lemonade,booth,and,others,took,their,places,at,the,counter,<END>
their,booth,did,not,have,so,many,customers,as,did,the,other,booths,where,the,tootling,laugh,of,maybelle,merriwether,sounded,and,fanny,elsing's,giggles,and,the,whiting,girls',repartee,made,merriment,<END>
melly,sold,useless,stuff,to,men,who,could,have,no,possible,use,for,it,as,quietly,and,serenely,as,a,shopkeeper,and,scarlett,patterned,her,conduct,on,melly's,<END>
there,were,crowds,in,front,of,every,other,counter,but,theirs,girls,chattering,men,buying,<END>
the,few,who,came,to,them,talked,about,how,they,went,to,the,university,with,ashley,and,what,a,fine,soldier,he,was,or,spoke,in,respectful,tones,of,charles,and,how,great,a,loss,to,atlanta,his,death,had,been,<END>
then,the,music,broke,into,the,rollicking,strains,of,johnny,booker,he'p,dis,nigger,<END>
and,scarlett,thought,she,would,scream,<END>
she,wanted,to,dance,<END>
she,wanted,to,dance,<END>
she,looked,across,the,floor,and,tapped,her,foot,to,the,music,and,her,green,eyes,blazed,so,eagerly,that,they,fairly,snapped,<END>
all,the,way,across,the,floor,a,man,newly,come,and,standing,in,the,doorway,saw,them,started,in,recognition,and,watched,closely,the,slanting,eyes,in,the,sulky,rebellious,face,<END>
then,he,grinned,to,himself,as,he,recognized,the,invitation,that,any,male,could,read,<END>
he,was,dressed,in,black,broadcloth,a,tall,man,towering,over,the,officers,who,stood,near,him,bulky,in,the,shoulders,but,tapering,to,a,small,waist,and,absurdly,small,feet,in,varnished,boots,<END>
his,severe,black,suit,with,fine,ruffled,shirt,and,trousers,smartly,strapped,beneath,high,insteps,was,oddly,at,variance,with,his,physique,and,face,for,he,was,foppishly,groomed,the,clothes,of,a,dandy,on,a,body,that,was,powerful,and,latently,dangerous,in,its,lazy,grace,<END>
his,hair,was,jet,black,and,his,black,mustache,was,small,and,closely,clipped,almost,foreign,looking,compared,with,the,dashing,swooping,mustaches,of,the,cavalrymen,near,by,<END>
he,looked,and,was,a,man,of,lusty,and,unashamed,appetites,<END>
he,had,an,air,of,utter,assurance,of,displeasing,insolence,about,him,and,there,was,a,twinkle,of,malice,in,his,bold,eyes,as,he,stared,at,scarlett,until,finally,feeling,his,gaze,she,looked,toward,him,<END>
somewhere,in,her,mind,the,bell,of,recognition,rang,but,for,the,moment,she,could,not,recall,who,he,was,<END>
but,he,was,the,first,man,in,months,who,had,displayed,an,interest,in,her,and,she,threw,him,a,gay,smile,<END>
she,made,a,little,curtsy,as,he,bowed,and,then,as,he,straightened,and,started,toward,her,with,a,peculiarly,lithe,indian-like,gait,her,hand,went,to,her,mouth,in,horror,for,she,knew,who,he,was,<END>
thunderstruck,she,stood,as,if,paralyzed,while,he,made,his,way,through,the,crowd,<END>
then,she,turned,blindly,bent,on,flight,into,the,refreshment,rooms,but,her,skirt,caught,on,a,nail,of,the,booth,<END>
she,jerked,furiously,at,it,tearing,it,and,in,an,instant,he,was,beside,her,<END>
permit,me,he,said,bending,over,and,disentangling,the,flounce,<END>
i,hardly,hoped,that,you,would,recall,me,miss,o'hara,<END>
his,voice,was,oddly,pleasant,to,the,ear,the,well-modulated,voice,of,a,gentleman,resonant,and,overlaid,with,the,flat,slow,drawl,of,the,charlestonian,<END>
she,looked,up,at,him,imploringly,her,face,crimson,with,the,shame,of,their,last,meeting,and,met,two,of,the,blackest,eyes,she,had,ever,seen,dancing,in,merciless,merriment,<END>
of,all,the,people,in,the,world,to,turn,up,here,this,terrible,person,who,had,witnessed,that,scene,with,ashley,which,still,gave,her,nightmares,this,odious,wretch,who,ruined,girls,and,was,not,received,by,nice,people,this,despicable,man,who,had,said,and,with,good,cause,that,she,was,not,a,lady,<END>
at,the,sound,of,his,voice,melanie,turned,and,for,the,first,time,in,her,life,scarlett,thanked,god,for,the,existence,of,her,sister-,in-law,<END>
why,it's,it's,mr,rhett,butler,isn't,it,<END>
said,melanie,with,a,little,smile,putting,out,her,hand,<END>
i,met,you,<END>
on,the,happy,occasion,of,the,announcement,of,your,betrothal,he,finished,bending,over,her,hand,<END>
it,is,kind,of,you,to,recall,me,<END>

why,you,you,must,be,the,famous,captain,butler,we've,been,hearing,so,much,about,the,blockade,runner,<END>
why,every,girl,here,is,wearing,dresses,you,brought,in,<END>

scarlett,sank,to,the,stool,her,breath,coming,so,rapidly,she,feared,the,lacings,of,her,stays,would,burst,<END>
oh,what,a,terrible,thing,to,happen,<END>
she,had,never,thought,to,meet,this,man,again,<END>
he,picked,up,her,black,fan,from,the,counter,and,began,fanning,her,solicitously,too,solicitously,his,face,grave,but,his,eyes,still,dancing,<END>
it,is,quite,warm,in,here,he,said,<END>
no,wonder,miss,o'hara,is,faint,<END>

it,would,be,a,pleasure,to,renew,acquaintances,<END>
my,husband,is,in,virginia,said,melly,with,a,proud,lift,of,her,head,<END>

oh,please,god,don't,let,anybody,else,see,through,him,she,thought,with,a,start,of,terror,<END>
would,he,tell,what,he,knew,<END>
of,course,he,wasn't,a,gentleman,and,there,was,no,telling,what,men,would,do,when,they,weren't,gentlemen,<END>
there,was,no,standard,to,judge,them,by,<END>
she,looked,up,at,him,and,saw,that,his,mouth,was,pulled,down,at,the,corners,in,mock,sympathy,even,while,he,swished,the,fan,<END>
something,in,his,look,challenged,her,spirit,and,brought,her,strength,back,in,a,surge,of,dislike,<END>
abruptly,she,snatched,the,fan,from,his,hand,<END>
i'm,quite,all,right,she,said,tartly,<END>
there's,no,need,to,blow,my,hair,out,of,place,<END>
scarlett,darling,<END>
captain,butler,you,must,forgive,her,<END>
she,she,isn't,herself,when,she,hears,poor,charlie's,name,spoken,and,perhaps,after,all,we,shouldn't,have,come,here,tonight,<END>
we're,still,in,mourning,you,see,and,it's,quite,a,strain,on,her,all,this,gaiety,and,music,poor,child,<END>
i,quite,understand,he,said,with,elaborate,gravity,but,as,he,turned,and,gave,melanie,a,searching,look,that,went,to,the,bottom,of,her,sweet,worried,eyes,his,expression,changed,reluctant,respect,and,gentleness,coming,over,his,dark,face,<END>
i,think,you're,a,courageous,little,lady,mrs,<END>
wilkes,<END>
not,a,word,about,me,<END>
thought,scarlett,indignantly,as,melly,smiled,in,confusion,and,answered,<END>
dear,me,no,captain,butler,<END>
the,hospital,committee,just,had,to,have,us,for,this,booth,because,at,the,last,minute,a,pillow,case,<END>
here's,a,lovely,one,with,a,flag,on,it,<END>
she,turned,to,three,cavalrymen,who,appeared,at,her,counter,<END>
for,a,moment,melanie,thought,how,nice,captain,butler,was,<END>
then,she,wished,that,something,more,substantial,than,cheesecloth,was,between,her,skirt,and,the,spittoon,that,stood,just,outside,the,booth,for,the,aim,of,the,horsemen,with,amber,streams,of,tobacco,juice,was,not,so,unerring,as,with,their,long,horse,pistols,<END>
then,she,forgot,about,the,captain,scarlett,and,the,spittoons,as,more,customers,crowded,to,her,<END>
scarlett,sat,quietly,on,the,stool,fanning,herself,not,daring,to,look,up,wishing,captain,butler,back,on,the,deck,of,his,ship,where,he,belonged,<END>
your,husband,has,been,dead,long,<END>
oh,yes,a,long,time,<END>
almost,a,year,<END>
an,aeon,i'm,sure,<END>
scarlett,was,not,sure,what,an,aeon,was,but,there,was,no,mistaking,the,baiting,quality,of,his,voice,so,she,said,nothing,<END>
had,you,been,married,long,<END>
forgive,my,questions,but,i,have,been,away,from,this,section,for,so,long,<END>
two,months,said,scarlett,unwillingly,<END>
a,tragedy,no,less,his,easy,voice,continued,<END>
oh,damn,him,she,thought,violently,<END>
if,he,was,any,other,man,in,the,world,i,could,simply,freeze,up,and,order,him,off,<END>
but,he,knows,about,ashley,and,he,knows,i,didn't,love,charlie,<END>
and,my,hands,are,tied,<END>
she,said,nothing,still,looking,down,at,her,fan,<END>
and,this,is,your,first,social,appearance,<END>
i,know,it,looks,quite,odd,she,explained,rapidly,<END>
but,the,mclure,girls,who,were,to,take,this,booth,were,called,away,and,there,was,no,one,else,so,melanie,and,i,<END>
no,sacrifice,is,too,great,for,the,cause,<END>
why,that,was,what,mrs,elsing,had,said,but,when,she,said,it,it,didn't,sound,the,same,way,<END>
hot,words,started,to,her,lips,but,she,choked,them,back,<END>
after,all,she,was,here,not,for,the,cause,but,because,she,was,tired,of,sitting,home,<END>
i,have,always,thought,he,said,reflectively,that,the,system,of,mourning,of,immuring,women,in,crepe,for,the,rest,of,their,lives,and,forbidding,them,normal,enjoyment,is,just,as,barbarous,as,the,hindu,suttee,<END>
settee,<END>
he,laughed,and,she,blushed,for,her,ignorance,<END>
she,hated,people,who,used,words,unknown,to,her,<END>
in,india,when,a,man,dies,he,is,burned,instead,of,buried,and,his,wife,always,climbs,on,the,funeral,pyre,and,is,burned,with,him,<END>
how,dreadful,<END>
why,do,they,do,it,<END>
don't,the,police,do,anything,about,it,<END>
of,course,not,<END>
a,wife,who,didn't,burn,herself,would,be,a,social,outcast,<END>
all,the,worthy,hindu,matrons,would,talk,about,her,for,not,behaving,as,a,well-bred,lady,should,precisely,as,those,worthy,matrons,in,the,corner,would,talk,about,you,should,you,appear,tonight,in,a,red,dress,and,lead,a,reel,<END>
personally,i,think,suttee,much,more,merciful,than,our,charming,southern,custom,of,burying,widows,alive,<END>
how,dare,you,say,i'm,buried,alive,<END>
how,closely,women,crutch,the,very,chains,that,bind,them,<END>
you,think,the,hindu,custom,barbarous,but,would,you,have,had,the,courage,to,appear,here,tonight,if,the,confederacy,hadn't,needed,you,<END>
arguments,of,this,character,were,always,confusing,to,scarlett,<END>
his,were,doubly,confusing,because,she,had,a,vague,idea,there,was,truth,in,them,<END>
but,now,was,the,time,to,squelch,him,<END>
of,course,i,wouldn't,have,come,<END>
it,would,have,been,well,disrespectful,to,it,would,have,seemed,as,if,i,hadn't,lov,<END>
his,eyes,waited,on,her,words,cynical,amusement,in,them,and,she,could,not,go,on,<END>
he,knew,she,hadn't,loved,charlie,and,he,wouldn't,let,her,pretend,to,the,nice,polite,sentiments,that,she,should,express,<END>
what,a,terrible,terrible,thing,it,was,to,have,to,do,with,a,man,who,wasn't,a,gentleman,<END>
a,gentleman,always,appeared,to,believe,a,lady,even,when,he,knew,she,was,lying,<END>
that,was,southern,chivalry,<END>
a,gentleman,always,obeyed,the,rules,and,said,the,correct,things,and,made,life,easier,for,a,lady,<END>
but,this,man,seemed,not,to,care,for,rules,and,evidently,enjoyed,talking,of,things,no,one,ever,talked,about,<END>
i,am,waiting,breathlessly,<END>
i,think,you,are,horrid,she,said,helplessly,dropping,her,eyes,<END>
he,leaned,down,across,the,counter,until,his,mouth,was,near,her,ear,and,hissed,in,a,very,creditable,imitation,of,the,stage,villains,who,appeared,infrequently,at,the,athenaeum,hall,fear,not,fair,lady,<END>
your,guilty,secret,is,safe,with,me,<END>
oh,she,whispered,feverishly,how,can,you,say,such,things,<END>
i,only,thought,to,ease,your,mind,<END>
what,would,you,have,me,say,<END>
'be,mine,beautiful,female,or,i,will,reveal,all,',<END>
she,met,his,eyes,unwillingly,and,saw,they,were,as,teasing,as,a,small,boy's,<END>
suddenly,she,laughed,<END>
it,was,such,a,silly,situation,after,all,<END>
he,laughed,too,and,so,loudly,that,several,of,the,chaperons,in,the,corner,looked,their,way,<END>
observing,how,good,a,time,charles,hamilton's,widow,appeared,to,be,having,with,a,perfect,stranger,they,put,their,heads,together,disapprovingly,<END>
there,was,a,roll,of,drums,and,many,voices,cried,sh,<END>
as,dr,meade,mounted,the,platform,and,spread,out,his,arms,for,quiet,<END>
we,must,all,give,grateful,thanks,to,the,charming,ladies,whose,indefatigable,and,patriotic,efforts,have,made,this,bazaar,not,only,a,pecuniary,success,he,began,but,have,transformed,this,rough,hall,into,a,bower,of,loveliness,a,fit,garden,for,the,charming,rosebuds,i,see,about,me,<END>
everyone,clapped,approvingly,<END>
the,ladies,have,given,their,best,not,only,of,their,time,but,of,the,labor,of,their,hands,and,these,beautiful,objects,in,the,booths,are,doubly,beautiful,made,as,they,are,by,the,fair,hands,of,our,charming,southern,women,<END>
there,were,more,shouts,of,approval,and,rhett,butler,who,had,been,lounging,negligently,against,the,counter,at,scarlett's,side,whispered,pompous,goat,isn't,he,<END>
startled,at,first,horrified,at,this,lese,majesty,toward,atlanta's,most,beloved,citizen,she,stared,reprovingly,at,him,<END>
but,the,doctor,did,look,like,a,goat,with,his,gray,chin,whiskers,wagging,away,at,a,great,rate,and,with,difficulty,she,stifled,a,giggle,<END>
but,these,things,are,not,enough,<END>
the,good,ladies,of,the,hospital,committee,whose,cool,hands,have,soothed,many,a,suffering,brow,and,brought,back,from,the,jaws,of,death,our,brave,men,wounded,in,the,bravest,of,all,causes,know,our,needs,<END>
i,will,not,enumerate,them,<END>
we,must,have,more,money,to,buy,medical,supplies,from,england,and,we,have,with,us,tonight,the,intrepid,captain,who,has,so,successfully,run,the,blockade,for,a,year,and,who,will,run,it,again,to,bring,us,the,drugs,we,need,<END>
captain,rhett,butler,<END>
though,caught,unawares,the,blockader,made,a,graceful,bow,too,graceful,thought,scarlett,trying,to,analyze,it,<END>
it,was,almost,as,if,he,overdid,his,courtesy,because,his,contempt,for,everybody,present,was,so,great,<END>
there,was,a,loud,burst,of,applause,as,he,bowed,and,a,craning,of,necks,from,the,ladies,in,the,corner,<END>
so,that,was,who,poor,charles,hamilton's,widow,was,carrying,on,with,<END>
and,charlie,hardly,dead,a,year,<END>
we,need,more,gold,and,i,am,asking,you,for,it,the,doctor,continued,<END>
i,am,asking,a,sacrifice,but,a,sacrifice,so,small,compared,with,the,sacrifices,our,gallant,men,in,gray,are,making,that,it,will,seem,laughably,small,<END>
ladies,i,want,your,jewelry,<END>
_i_,want,your,jewelry,<END>
no,the,confederacy,wants,your,jewelry,the,confederacy,calls,for,it,and,i,know,no,one,will,hold,back,<END>
how,fair,a,gem,gleams,on,a,lovely,wrist,<END>
how,beautifully,gold,brooches,glitter,on,the,bosoms,of,our,patriotic,women,<END>
but,how,much,more,beautiful,is,sacrifice,than,all,the,gold,and,gems,of,the,ind,<END>
the,gold,will,be,melted,and,the,stones,sold,and,the,money,used,to,buy,drugs,and,other,medical,supplies,<END>
ladies,there,will,pass,among,you,two,of,our,gallant,wounded,with,baskets,and,but,the,rest,of,his,speech,was,lost,in,the,storm,and,tumult,of,clapping,hands,and,cheering,voices,<END>
scarlett's,first,thought,was,one,of,deep,thankfulness,that,mourning,forbade,her,wearing,her,precious,earbobs,and,the,heavy,gold,chain,that,had,been,grandma,robillard's,and,the,gold,and,black,enameled,bracelets,and,the,garnet,brooch,<END>
she,saw,the,little,zouave,a,split-oak,basket,over,his,unwounded,arm,making,the,rounds,of,the,crowd,on,her,side,of,the,hall,and,saw,women,old,and,young,laughing,eager,tugging,at,bracelets,squealing,in,pretended,pain,as,earrings,came,from,pierced,flesh,helping,each,other,undo,stiff,necklace,clasps,unpinning,brooches,from,bosoms,<END>
there,was,a,steady,little,clink-clink,of,metal,on,metal,and,cries,of,wait,wait,<END>
i've,got,it,unfastened,now,<END>
there,<END>
maybelle,merriwether,was,pulling,off,her,lovely,twin,bracelets,from,above,and,below,her,elbows,<END>
fanny,elsing,crying,mamma,may,i,<END>
was,tearing,from,her,curls,the,seed-pearl,ornament,set,in,heavy,gold,which,had,been,in,the,family,for,generations,<END>
as,each,offering,went,into,the,basket,there,was,applause,and,cheering,<END>
the,grinning,little,man,was,coming,to,their,booth,now,his,basket,heavy,on,his,arm,and,as,he,passed,rhett,butler,a,handsome,gold,cigar,case,was,thrown,carelessly,into,the,basket,<END>
when,he,came,to,scarlett,and,rested,his,basket,upon,the,counter,she,shook,her,head,throwing,wide,her,hands,to,show,that,she,had,nothing,to,give,<END>
it,was,embarrassing,to,be,the,only,person,present,who,was,giving,nothing,<END>
and,then,she,saw,the,bright,gleam,of,her,wide,gold,wedding,ring,<END>
for,a,confused,moment,she,tried,to,remember,charles',face,how,he,had,looked,when,he,slipped,it,on,her,finger,<END>
but,the,memory,was,blurred,blurred,by,the,sudden,feeling,of,irritation,that,memory,of,him,always,brought,to,her,<END>
charles,he,was,the,reason,why,life,was,over,for,her,why,she,was,an,old,woman,<END>
with,a,sudden,wrench,she,seized,the,ring,but,it,stuck,<END>
the,zouave,was,moving,toward,melanie,<END>
wait,<END>
cried,scarlett,<END>
i,have,something,for,you,<END>
the,ring,came,off,and,as,she,started,to,throw,it,into,the,basket,heaped,up,with,chains,watches,rings,pins,and,bracelets,she,caught,rhett,butler's,eye,<END>
his,lips,were,twisted,in,a,slight,smile,<END>
defiantly,she,tossed,the,ring,onto,the,top,of,the,pile,<END>
oh,my,darling,<END>
whispered,molly,clutching,her,arm,her,eyes,blazing,with,love,and,pride,<END>
you,brave,brave,girl,<END>
wait,please,wait,lieutenant,picard,<END>
i,have,something,for,you,too,<END>
she,was,tugging,at,her,own,wedding,ring,the,ring,scarlett,knew,had,never,once,left,that,finger,since,ashley,put,it,there,<END>
scarlett,knew,as,no,one,did,how,much,it,meant,to,her,<END>
it,came,off,with,difficulty,and,for,a,brief,instant,was,clutched,tightly,in,the,small,palm,<END>
then,it,was,laid,gently,on,the,pile,of,jewelry,<END>
the,two,girls,stood,looking,after,the,zouave,who,was,moving,toward,the,group,of,elderly,ladies,in,the,corner,scarlett,defiant,melanie,with,a,look,more,pitiful,than,tears,<END>
and,neither,expression,was,lost,on,the,man,who,stood,beside,them,<END>
if,you,hadn't,been,brave,enough,to,do,it,i,would,never,have,been,either,said,melly,putting,her,arm,about,scarlett's,waist,and,giving,her,a,gentle,squeeze,<END>
for,a,moment,scarlett,wanted,to,shake,her,off,and,cry,name,of,god,<END>
at,the,top,of,her,lungs,as,gerald,did,when,he,was,irritated,but,she,caught,rhett,butler's,eye,and,managed,a,very,sour,smile,<END>
it,was,annoying,the,way,melly,always,misconstrued,her,motives,but,perhaps,that,was,far,preferable,to,having,her,suspect,the,truth,<END>
what,a,beautiful,gesture,said,rhett,butler,softly,<END>
it,is,such,sacrifices,as,yours,that,hearten,our,brave,lads,in,gray,<END>
hot,words,bubbled,to,her,lips,and,it,was,with,difficulty,that,she,checked,them,<END>
there,was,mockery,in,everything,he,said,<END>
she,disliked,him,heartily,lounging,there,against,the,booth,<END>
but,there,was,something,stimulating,about,him,something,warm,and,vital,and,electric,<END>
all,that,was,irish,in,her,rose,to,the,challenge,of,his,black,eyes,<END>
she,decided,she,was,going,to,take,this,man,down,a,notch,or,two,<END>
his,knowledge,of,her,secret,gave,him,an,advantage,over,her,that,was,exasperating,so,she,would,have,to,change,that,by,putting,him,at,a,disadvantage,somehow,<END>
she,stifled,her,impulse,to,tell,him,exactly,what,she,thought,of,him,<END>
sugar,always,caught,more,flies,than,vinegar,as,mammy,often,said,and,she,was,going,to,catch,and,subdue,this,fly,so,he,could,never,again,have,her,at,his,mercy,<END>
thank,you,she,said,sweetly,deliberately,misunderstanding,his,jibe,<END>
a,compliment,like,that,coming,from,so,famous,a,man,as,captain,butler,is,appreciated,<END>
he,threw,back,his,head,and,laughed,freely,yelped,was,what,scarlett,thought,fiercely,her,face,becoming,pink,again,<END>
why,don't,you,say,what,you,really,think,<END>
he,demanded,lowering,his,voice,so,that,in,the,clatter,and,excitement,of,the,collection,it,came,only,to,her,ears,<END>
why,don't,you,say,i'm,a,damned,rascal,and,no,gentleman,and,that,i,must,take,myself,off,or,you'll,have,one,of,these,gallant,boys,in,gray,call,me,out,<END>
it,was,on,the,tip,of,her,tongue,to,answer,tartly,but,she,managed,by,heroic,control,to,say,why,captain,butler,<END>
how,you,do,run,on,<END>
as,if,everybody,didn't,know,how,famous,you,are,and,how,brave,and,what,a,what,a,<END>
i,am,disappointed,in,you,he,said,<END>
disappointed,<END>
yes,<END>
on,the,occasion,of,our,first,eventful,meeting,i,thought,to,myself,that,i,had,at,last,met,a,girl,who,was,not,only,beautiful,but,who,had,courage,<END>
and,now,i,see,that,you,are,only,beautiful,<END>
do,you,mean,to,call,me,a,coward,<END>
she,was,ruffling,like,a,hen,<END>
exactly,<END>
you,lack,the,courage,to,say,what,you,really,think,<END>
when,i,first,met,you,i,thought,there,is,a,girl,in,a,million,<END>
she,isn't,like,these,other,silly,little,fools,who,believe,everything,their,mammas,tell,them,and,act,on,it,no,matter,how,they,feel,<END>
and,conceal,all,their,feelings,and,desires,and,little,heartbreaks,behind,a,lot,of,sweet,words,<END>
i,thought,miss,o'hara,is,a,girl,of,rare,spirit,<END>
she,knows,what,she,wants,and,she,doesn't,mind,speaking,her,mind,or,throwing,vases,<END>
oh,she,said,rage,breaking,through,<END>
then,i'll,speak,my,mind,right,this,minute,<END>
if,you'd,had,any,raising,at,all,you'd,never,have,come,over,here,and,talked,to,me,<END>
you'd,have,known,i,never,wanted,to,lay,eyes,on,you,again,<END>
but,you,aren't,a,gentleman,<END>
you,are,just,a,nasty,ill-bred,creature,<END>
and,you,think,that,because,your,rotten,little,boats,can,outrun,the,yankees,you've,the,right,to,come,here,and,jeer,at,men,who,are,brave,and,women,who,are,sacrificing,everything,for,the,cause,<END>
stop,stop,he,begged,with,a,grin,<END>
you,started,off,very,nicely,and,said,what,you,thought,but,don't,begin,talking,to,me,about,the,cause,<END>
i'm,tired,of,hearing,about,it,and,i'll,bet,you,are,too,<END>
why,how,did,she,began,caught,off,her,balance,and,then,checked,herself,hastily,boiling,with,anger,at,herself,for,falling,into,his,trap,<END>
i,stood,there,in,the,doorway,before,you,saw,me,and,i,watched,you,he,said,<END>
and,i,watched,the,other,girls,<END>
and,they,all,looked,as,though,their,faces,came,out,of,one,mold,<END>
yours,didn't,<END>
you,have,an,easy,face,to,read,<END>
you,didn't,have,your,mind,on,your,business,and,i'll,wager,you,weren't,thinking,about,our,cause,or,the,hospital,<END>
it,was,all,over,your,face,that,you,wanted,to,dance,and,have,a,good,time,and,you,couldn't,<END>
so,you,were,mad,clean,through,<END>
tell,the,truth,<END>
am,i,not,right,<END>
i,have,nothing,more,to,say,to,you,captain,butler,she,said,as,formally,as,she,could,trying,to,draw,the,rags,of,her,dignity,about,her,<END>
just,because,you're,conceited,at,being,the,'great,blockader',doesn't,give,you,the,right,to,insult,women,<END>
the,great,blockader,<END>
that's,a,joke,<END>
pray,give,me,only,one,moment,more,of,your,precious,time,before,you,cast,me,into,darkness,<END>
i,wouldn't,want,so,charming,a,little,patriot,to,be,left,under,a,misapprehension,about,my,contribution,to,the,confederate,cause,<END>
i,don't,care,to,listen,to,your,brags,<END>
blockading,is,a,business,with,me,and,i'm,making,money,out,of,it,<END>
when,i,stop,making,money,out,of,it,i'll,quit,<END>
what,do,you,think,of,that,<END>
i,think,you're,a,mercenary,rascal,just,like,the,yankees,<END>
exactly,he,grinned,<END>
and,the,yankees,help,me,make,my,money,<END>
why,last,month,i,sailed,my,boat,right,into,new,york,harbor,and,took,on,a,cargo,<END>
what,<END>
cried,scarlett,interested,and,excited,in,spite,of,herself,<END>
didn't,they,shell,you,<END>
my,poor,innocent,<END>
of,course,not,<END>
there,are,plenty,of,sturdy,union,patriots,who,are,not,averse,to,picking,up,money,selling,goods,to,the,confederacy,<END>
i,run,my,boat,into,new,york,buy,from,yankee,firms,sub,rosa,of,course,and,away,i,go,<END>
and,when,that,gets,a,bit,dangerous,i,go,to,nassau,where,these,same,union,patriots,have,brought,powder,and,shells,and,hoop,skirts,for,me,<END>
it's,more,convenient,than,going,to,england,<END>
sometimes,it's,a,bit,difficult,running,it,into,charleston,or,wilmington,but,you'd,be,surprised,how,far,a,little,gold,goes,<END>
oh,i,knew,yankees,were,vile,but,i,didn't,know,<END>
why,quibble,about,the,yankees,earning,an,honest,penny,selling,out,the,union,<END>
it,won't,matter,in,a,hundred,years,<END>
the,result,will,be,the,same,<END>
they,know,the,confederacy,will,be,licked,eventually,so,why,shouldn't,they,cash,in,on,it,<END>

of,course,<END>
will,you,please,leave,me,or,will,it,be,necessary,for,me,to,call,my,carriage,and,go,home,to,get,rid,of,you,<END>
a,red-hot,little,rebel,he,said,with,another,sudden,grin,<END>
he,bowed,and,sauntered,off,leaving,her,with,her,bosom,heaving,with,impotent,rage,and,indignation,<END>
there,was,disappointment,burning,in,her,that,she,could,not,quite,analyze,the,disappointment,of,a,child,seeing,illusions,crumble,<END>
how,dared,he,take,the,glamor,from,the,blockaders,<END>
and,how,dared,he,say,the,confederacy,would,be,licked,<END>
he,should,be,shot,for,that,shot,like,a,traitor,<END>
she,looked,about,the,hall,at,the,familiar,faces,so,assured,of,success,so,brave,so,devoted,and,somehow,a,cold,little,chill,set,in,at,her,heart,<END>
licked,<END>
these,people,why,of,course,not,<END>
the,very,idea,was,impossible,disloyal,<END>
what,were,you,two,whispering,about,<END>
asked,melanie,turning,to,scarlett,as,her,customers,drifted,off,<END>
i,couldn't,help,seeing,that,mrs,merriwether,had,her,eye,on,you,all,the,time,and,dear,you,know,how,she,talks,<END>
oh,the,man's,impossible,an,ill-bred,boor,said,scarlett,<END>
and,as,for,old,lady,merriwether,let,her,talk,<END>
i'm,sick,of,acting,like,a,ninny,just,for,her,benefit,<END>
why,scarlett,<END>
cried,melanie,scandalized,<END>
sh-sh,said,scarlett,<END>
dr,meade,is,going,to,make,another,announcement,<END>
the,gathering,quieted,again,as,the,doctor,raised,his,voice,at,first,in,thanks,to,the,ladies,who,had,so,willingly,given,their,jewelry,<END>
and,now,ladies,and,gentlemen,i,am,going,to,propose,a,surprise,an,innovation,that,may,shock,some,of,you,but,i,ask,you,to,remember,that,all,this,is,done,for,the,hospital,and,for,the,benefit,of,our,boys,lying,there,<END>
everyone,edged,forward,in,anticipation,trying,to,imagine,what,the,sedate,doctor,could,propose,that,would,be,shocking,<END>
the,dancing,is,about,to,begin,and,the,first,number,will,of,course,be,a,reel,followed,by,a,waltz,<END>
the,dances,following,the,polkas,the,schottisches,the,mazurkas,will,be,preceded,by,short,reels,<END>
i,know,the,gentle,rivalry,to,lead,the,reels,very,well,and,so,the,doctor,mopped,his,brow,and,cast,a,quizzical,glance,at,the,corner,where,his,wife,sat,among,the,chaperons,<END>
gentlemen,if,you,wish,to,lead,a,reel,with,the,lady,of,your,choice,you,must,bargain,for,her,<END>
i,will,be,auctioneer,and,the,proceeds,will,go,to,the,hospital,<END>
fans,stopped,in,mid-swish,and,a,ripple,of,excited,murmuring,ran,through,the,hall,<END>
the,chaperons',corner,was,in,tumult,and,mrs,meade,anxious,to,support,her,husband,in,an,action,of,which,she,heartily,disapproved,was,at,a,disadvantage,<END>
mrs,elsing,mrs,merriwether,and,mrs,whiting,were,red,with,indignation,<END>
but,suddenly,the,home,guard,gave,a,cheer,and,it,was,taken,up,by,the,other,uniformed,guests,<END>
the,young,girls,clapped,their,hands,and,jumped,excitedly,<END>
don't,you,think,it's,it's,just,just,a,little,like,a,slave,auction,<END>
whispered,melanie,staring,uncertainly,at,the,embattled,doctor,who,heretofore,had,been,perfect,in,her,eyes,<END>
scarlett,said,nothing,but,her,eyes,glittered,and,her,heart,contracted,with,a,little,pain,<END>
if,only,she,were,not,a,widow,<END>
if,only,she,were,scarlett,o'hara,again,out,there,on,the,floor,in,an,apple-green,dress,with,dark-green,velvet,ribbons,dangling,from,her,bosom,and,tuberoses,in,her,black,hair,she'd,lead,that,reel,<END>
yes,indeed,<END>
there'd,be,a,dozen,men,battling,for,her,and,paying,over,money,to,the,doctor,<END>
oh,to,have,to,sit,here,a,wallflower,against,her,will,and,see,fanny,or,maybelle,lead,the,first,reel,as,the,belle,of,atlanta,<END>
above,the,tumult,sounded,the,voice,of,the,little,zouave,his,creole,accent,very,obvious,eef,i,may,twenty,dollars,for,mees,maybelle,merriwether,<END>
maybelle,collapsed,with,blushes,against,fanny's,shoulder,and,the,two,girls,hid,their,faces,in,each,other's,necks,and,giggled,as,other,voices,began,calling,other,names,other,amounts,of,money,<END>
dr,meade,had,begun,to,smile,again,ignoring,completely,the,indignant,whispers,that,came,from,the,ladies',hospital,committee,in,the,corner,<END>
at,first,mrs,merriwether,had,stated,flatly,and,loudly,that,her,maybelle,would,never,take,part,in,such,a,proceeding,but,as,maybelle's,name,was,called,most,often,and,the,amount,went,up,to,seventy-five,dollars,her,protests,began,to,dwindle,<END>
scarlett,leaned,her,elbows,on,the,counter,and,almost,glared,at,the,excited,laughing,crowd,surging,about,the,platform,their,hands,full,of,confederate,paper,money,<END>
now,they,would,all,dance,except,her,and,the,old,ladies,<END>
now,everyone,would,have,a,good,time,except,her,<END>
she,saw,rhett,butler,standing,just,below,the,doctor,and,before,she,could,change,the,expression,of,her,face,he,saw,her,and,one,corner,of,his,mouth,went,down,and,one,eyebrow,went,up,<END>
she,jerked,her,chin,up,and,turned,away,from,him,and,suddenly,she,heard,her,own,name,called,called,in,an,unmistakable,charleston,voice,that,rang,out,above,the,hubbub,of,other,names,<END>
mrs,charles,hamilton,one,hundred,and,fifty,dollars,in,gold,<END>
a,sudden,hush,fell,on,the,crowd,both,at,the,mention,of,the,sum,and,at,the,name,<END>
scarlett,was,so,startled,she,could,not,even,move,<END>
she,remained,sitting,with,her,chin,in,her,hands,her,eyes,wide,with,astonishment,<END>
everybody,turned,to,look,at,her,<END>
she,saw,the,doctor,lean,down,from,the,platform,and,whisper,something,to,rhett,butler,<END>
probably,telling,him,she,was,in,mourning,and,it,was,impossible,for,her,to,appear,on,the,floor,<END>
she,saw,rhett's,shoulders,shrug,lazily,<END>
another,one,of,our,belles,perhaps,<END>
questioned,the,doctor,<END>
no,said,rhett,clearly,his,eyes,sweeping,the,crowd,carelessly,<END>
mrs,<END>
hamilton,<END>
i,tell,you,it,is,impossible,said,the,doctor,testily,<END>
mrs,hamilton,will,not,<END>
scarlett,heard,a,voice,which,at,first,she,did,not,recognize,as,her,own,<END>
yes,i,will,<END>
she,leaped,to,her,feet,her,heart,hammering,so,wildly,she,feared,she,could,not,stand,hammering,with,the,thrill,of,being,the,center,of,attention,again,of,being,the,most,highly,desired,girl,present,and,oh,best,of,all,at,the,prospect,of,dancing,again,<END>
oh,i,don't,care,<END>
i,don't,care,what,they,say,<END>
she,whispered,as,a,sweet,madness,swept,over,her,<END>
she,tossed,her,head,and,sped,out,of,the,booth,tapping,her,heels,like,castanets,snapping,open,her,black,silk,fan,to,its,widest,<END>
for,a,fleeting,instant,she,saw,melanie's,incredulous,face,the,look,on,the,chaperons',faces,the,petulant,girls,the,enthusiastic,approval,of,the,soldiers,<END>
then,she,was,on,the,floor,and,rhett,butler,was,advancing,toward,her,through,the,aisle,of,the,crowd,that,nasty,mocking,smile,on,his,face,<END>
but,she,didn't,care,didn't,care,if,he,were,abe,lincoln,himself,<END>
she,was,going,to,dance,again,<END>
she,was,going,to,lead,the,reel,<END>
she,swept,him,a,low,curtsy,and,a,dazzling,smile,and,he,bowed,one,hand,on,his,frilled,bosom,<END>
levi,horrified,was,quick,to,cover,the,situation,and,bawled,choose,yo',padners,fo',de,ferginny,reel,<END>
and,the,orchestra,crashed,into,that,best,of,all,reel,tunes,dixie,<END>
how,dare,you,make,me,so,conspicuous,captain,butler,<END>
but,my,dear,mrs,hamilton,you,so,obviously,wanted,to,be,conspicuous,<END>
how,could,you,call,my,name,out,in,front,of,everybody,<END>
you,could,have,refused,<END>
but,i,owe,it,to,the,cause,i,i,couldn't,think,of,myself,when,you,were,offering,so,much,in,gold,<END>
stop,laughing,everyone,is,looking,at,us,<END>
they,will,look,at,us,anyway,<END>
don't,try,to,palm,off,that,twaddle,about,the,cause,to,me,<END>
you,wanted,to,dance,and,i,gave,you,the,opportunity,<END>
this,march,is,the,last,figure,of,the,reel,isn't,it,<END>
yes,really,i,must,stop,and,sit,down,now,<END>
why,<END>
have,i,stepped,on,your,feet,<END>
no,but,they'll,talk,about,me,<END>
do,you,really,care,down,in,your,heart,<END>
well,<END>
you,aren't,committing,any,crime,are,you,<END>
why,not,dance,the,waltz,with,me,<END>
but,if,mother,ever,<END>
still,tied,to,mamma's,apronstrings,<END>
oh,you,have,the,nastiest,way,of,making,virtues,sound,so,stupid,<END>
but,virtues,are,stupid,<END>
do,you,care,if,people,talk,<END>
no,but,well,let's,don't,talk,about,it,<END>
thank,goodness,the,waltz,is,beginning,<END>
reels,always,leave,me,breathless,<END>
don't,dodge,my,questions,<END>
has,what,other,women,said,ever,mattered,to,you,<END>
oh,if,you're,going,to,pin,me,down,no,<END>
but,a,girl,is,supposed,to,mind,<END>
tonight,though,i,don't,care,<END>
bravo,<END>
now,you,are,beginning,to,think,for,yourself,instead,of,letting,others,think,for,you,<END>
that's,the,beginning,of,wisdom,<END>
oh,but,<END>
when,you've,been,talked,about,as,much,as,i,have,you'll,realize,how,little,it,matters,<END>
just,think,there's,not,a,home,in,charleston,where,i,am,received,<END>
not,even,my,contribution,to,our,just,and,holy,cause,lifts,the,ban,<END>
how,dreadful,<END>
oh,not,at,all,<END>
until,you've,lost,your,reputation,you,never,realize,what,a,burden,it,was,or,what,freedom,really,is,<END>
you,do,talk,scandalous,<END>
scandalously,and,truly,<END>
always,providing,you,have,enough,courage,or,money,you,can,do,without,a,reputation,<END>
money,can't,buy,everything,<END>
someone,must,have,told,you,that,<END>
you'd,never,think,of,such,a,platitude,all,by,yourself,<END>
what,can't,it,buy,<END>
oh,well,i,don't,know,not,happiness,or,love,anyway,<END>
generally,it,can,<END>
and,when,it,can't,it,can,buy,some,of,the,most,remarkable,substitutes,<END>
and,have,you,so,much,money,captain,butler,<END>
what,an,ill-bred,question,mrs,hamilton,<END>
i'm,surprised,<END>
but,yes,<END>
for,a,young,man,cut,off,without,a,shilling,in,early,youth,i've,done,very,well,<END>
and,i'm,sure,i'll,clean,up,a,million,on,the,blockade,<END>
oh,no,<END>
oh,yes,<END>
what,most,people,don't,seem,to,realize,is,that,there,is,just,as,much,money,to,be,made,out,of,the,wreckage,of,a,civilization,as,from,the,upbuilding,of,one,<END>
and,what,does,all,that,mean,<END>
your,family,and,my,family,and,everyone,here,tonight,made,their,money,out,of,changing,a,wilderness,into,a,civilization,<END>
that's,empire,building,<END>
there's,good,money,in,empire,building,<END>
but,there's,more,in,empire,wrecking,<END>
what,empire,are,you,talking,about,<END>
this,empire,we're,living,in,the,south,the,confederacy,the,cotton,kingdom,it's,breaking,up,right,under,our,feet,<END>
only,most,fools,won't,see,it,and,take,advantage,of,the,situation,created,by,the,collapse,<END>
i'm,making,my,fortune,out,of,the,wreckage,<END>
then,you,really,think,we're,going,to,get,licked,<END>
yes,<END>
why,be,an,ostrich,<END>
oh,dear,it,bores,me,to,talk,about,such,like,<END>
don't,you,ever,say,pretty,things,captain,butler,<END>

weeping,sad,and,lonely,sighs,and,tears,how,vain,<END>
when,this,cruel,war,is,over,pray,that,we,meet,again,<END>
of,course,it,was,'suit,of,blue',but,we,changed,it,to,'gray,',<END>
oh,you,waltz,so,well,captain,butler,<END>

i,just,couldn't,believe,my,eyes,and,poor,charlie,hardly,dead,a,year,<END>
and,that,awful,captain,butler,making,you,so,conspicuous,and,he's,a,terrible,terrible,person,scarlett,<END>
mrs,whiting's,cousin,mrs,coleman,whose,husband,came,from,charleston,told,me,about,him,<END>
he's,the,black,sheep,of,a,lovely,family,oh,how,could,any,of,the,butlers,ever,turn,out,anything,like,him,<END>
he,isn't,received,in,charleston,and,he,has,the,fastest,reputation,and,there,was,something,about,a,girl,something,so,bad,mrs,coleman,didn't,even,know,what,it,was,<END>
oh,i,can't,believe,he's,that,bad,said,melly,gently,<END>
he,seemed,a,perfect,gentleman,and,when,you,think,how,brave,he's,been,running,the,blockade,<END>
he,isn't,brave,said,scarlett,perversely,pouring,half,a,pitcher,of,syrup,over,her,waffles,<END>
he,just,does,it,for,money,<END>
he,told,me,so,<END>
he,doesn't,care,anything,about,the,confederacy,and,he,says,we're,going,to,get,licked,<END>
but,he,dances,divinely,<END>
her,audience,was,speechless,with,horror,<END>
i'm,tired,of,sitting,at,home,and,i'm,not,going,to,do,it,any,longer,<END>
if,they,all,talked,about,me,about,last,night,then,my,reputation,is,already,gone,and,it,won't,matter,what,else,they,say,<END>
it,did,not,occur,to,her,that,the,idea,was,rhett,butler's,<END>
it,came,so,patly,and,fitted,so,well,with,what,she,was,thinking,<END>
oh,<END>
what,will,your,mother,say,when,she,hears,<END>
what,will,she,think,of,me,<END>
a,cold,qualm,of,guilt,assailed,scarlett,at,the,thought,of,ellen's,consternation,should,she,ever,learn,of,her,daughter's,scandalous,conduct,<END>
but,she,took,heart,at,the,thought,of,the,twenty-five,miles,between,atlanta,and,tara,<END>
miss,pitty,certainly,wouldn't,tell,ellen,<END>
it,would,put,her,in,such,a,bad,light,as,a,chaperon,<END>
and,if,pitty,didn't,tattle,she,was,safe,<END>
i,think,said,pitty,yes,i,think,i'd,better,write,henry,a,letter,about,it,much,as,i,hate,it,but,he's,our,only,male,relative,and,make,him,go,speak,reprovingly,to,captain,butler,oh,dear,if,charlie,were,only,alive,you,must,never,never,speak,to,that,man,again,scarlett,<END>
melanie,had,been,sitting,quietly,her,hands,in,her,lap,her,waffles,cooling,on,her,plate,<END>
she,arose,and,coming,behind,scarlett,put,her,arms,about,her,neck,<END>
darling,she,said,don't,you,get,upset,<END>
i,understand,and,it,was,a,brave,thing,you,did,last,night,and,it's,going,to,help,the,hospital,a,lot,<END>
and,if,anybody,dares,say,one,little,word,about,you,i'll,tend,to,them,<END>
aunt,pitty,don't,cry,<END>
it,has,been,hard,on,scarlett,not,going,anywhere,<END>
she's,just,a,baby,<END>
her,fingers,played,in,scarlett's,black,hair,<END>
and,maybe,we'd,all,be,better,off,if,we,went,out,occasionally,to,parties,<END>
maybe,we've,been,very,selfish,staying,here,with,our,grief,<END>
war,times,aren't,like,other,times,<END>
when,i,think,of,all,the,soldiers,in,town,who,are,far,from,home,and,haven't,any,friends,to,call,on,at,night,and,the,ones,in,the,hospital,who,are,well,enough,to,be,out,of,bed,and,not,well,enough,to,go,back,in,the,army,why,we,have,been,selfish,<END>
we,ought,to,have,three,convalescents,in,our,house,this,minute,like,everybody,else,and,some,of,the,soldiers,out,to,dinner,every,sunday,<END>
there,scarlett,don't,you,fret,<END>

scarlett,was,far,from,fretting,and,melanie's,soft,hands,in,her,hair,were,irritating,<END>
she,wanted,to,jerk,her,head,away,and,say,oh,fiddle-dee-dee,<END>
for,the,warming,memory,was,still,on,her,of,how,the,home,guard,and,the,militia,and,the,soldiers,from,the,hospital,had,fought,for,her,dances,last,night,<END>
of,all,the,people,in,the,world,she,didn't,want,melly,for,a,defender,<END>
she,could,defend,herself,thank,you,and,if,the,old,cats,wanted,to,squall,well,she,could,get,along,without,the,old,cats,<END>
there,were,too,many,nice,officers,in,the,world,for,her,to,bother,about,what,old,women,said,<END>
pittypat,was,dabbing,at,her,eyes,under,melanie's,soothing,words,when,prissy,entered,with,a,bulky,letter,<END>

no,it's,not,ashley,<END>
i'm,so,sorry,i,scared,you,<END>
i,was,crying,because,i'm,so,happy,and,suddenly,she,opened,her,clenched,palm,and,pressed,some,object,that,was,in,it,to,her,lips,<END>
i'm,so,happy,and,burst,into,tears,again,<END>
scarlett,caught,a,fleeting,glimpse,and,saw,that,it,was,a,broad,gold,ring,<END>
read,it,said,melly,pointing,to,the,letter,on,the,floor,<END>
oh,how,sweet,how,kind,he,is,<END>
scarlett,bewildered,picked,up,the,single,sheet,and,saw,written,in,a,black,bold,hand,the,confederacy,may,need,the,lifeblood,of,its,men,but,not,yet,does,it,demand,the,heart's,blood,of,its,women,<END>
accept,dear,madam,this,token,of,my,reverence,for,your,courage,and,do,not,think,that,your,sacrifice,has,been,in,vain,for,this,ring,has,been,redeemed,at,ten,times,its,value,<END>
captain,rhett,butler,<END>
melanie,slipped,the,ring,on,her,finger,and,looked,at,it,lovingly,<END>
i,told,you,he,was,a,gentleman,didn't,i,<END>
she,said,turning,to,pittypat,her,smile,bright,through,the,teardrops,on,her,face,<END>
no,one,but,a,gentleman,of,refinement,and,thoughtfulness,would,ever,have,thought,how,it,broke,my,heart,to,i'll,send,my,gold,chain,instead,<END>
aunt,pittypat,you,must,write,him,a,note,and,invite,him,to,sunday,dinner,so,i,can,thank,him,<END>
in,the,excitement,neither,of,the,others,seemed,to,have,thought,that,captain,butler,had,not,returned,scarlett's,ring,too,<END>
but,she,thought,of,it,annoyed,<END>
and,she,knew,it,had,not,been,captain,butler's,refinement,that,had,prompted,so,gallant,a,gesture,<END>
it,was,that,he,intended,to,be,asked,into,pittypat's,house,and,knew,unerringly,how,to,get,the,invitation,<END>
i,was,greatly,disturbed,to,hear,of,your,recent,conduct,ran,ellen's,letter,and,scarlett,who,was,reading,it,at,the,table,scowled,<END>
bad,news,certainly,traveled,swiftly,<END>
she,had,often,heard,in,charleston,and,savannah,that,atlanta,people,gossiped,more,and,meddled,in,other,people's,business,more,than,any,other,people,in,the,south,and,now,she,believed,it,<END>
the,bazaar,had,taken,place,monday,night,and,today,was,only,thursday,<END>
which,of,the,old,cats,had,taken,it,upon,herself,to,write,ellen,<END>
for,a,moment,she,suspected,pittypat,but,immediately,abandoned,that,thought,<END>
poor,pittypat,had,been,quaking,in,her,number-three,shoes,for,fear,of,being,blamed,for,scarlett's,forward,conduct,and,would,be,the,last,to,notify,ellen,of,her,own,inadequate,chaperonage,<END>
probably,it,was,mrs,merriwether,<END>
it,is,difficult,for,me,to,believe,that,you,could,so,forget,yourself,and,your,rearing,<END>
i,will,pass,over,the,impropriety,of,your,appearing,publicly,while,in,mourning,realizing,your,warm,desire,to,be,of,assistance,to,the,hospital,<END>
but,to,dance,and,with,such,a,man,as,captain,butler,<END>
i,have,heard,much,of,him,as,who,has,not,<END>
and,pauline,wrote,me,only,last,week,that,he,is,a,man,of,bad,repute,and,not,even,received,by,his,own,family,in,charleston,except,of,course,by,his,heartbroken,mother,<END>
he,is,a,thoroughly,bad,character,who,would,take,advantage,of,your,youth,and,innocence,to,make,you,conspicuous,and,publicly,disgrace,you,and,your,family,<END>
how,could,miss,pittypat,have,so,neglected,her,duty,to,you,<END>
scarlett,looked,across,the,table,at,her,aunt,<END>
the,old,lady,had,recognized,ellen's,handwriting,and,her,fat,little,mouth,was,pursed,in,a,frightened,way,like,a,baby,who,fears,a,scolding,and,hopes,to,ward,it,off,by,tears,<END>
i,am,heartbroken,to,think,that,you,could,so,soon,forget,your,rearing,<END>
i,have,thought,of,calling,you,home,immediately,but,will,leave,that,to,your,father's,discretion,<END>
he,will,be,in,atlanta,friday,to,speak,with,captain,butler,and,to,escort,you,home,<END>
i,fear,he,will,be,severe,with,you,despite,my,pleadings,<END>
i,hope,and,pray,it,was,only,youth,and,thoughtlessness,that,prompted,such,forward,conduct,<END>
no,one,can,wish,to,serve,our,cause,more,than,i,and,i,wish,my,daughters,to,feel,the,same,way,but,to,disgrace,<END>
there,was,more,in,the,same,vein,but,scarlett,did,not,finish,it,<END>
for,once,she,was,thoroughly,frightened,<END>
she,did,not,feel,reckless,and,defiant,now,<END>
she,felt,as,young,and,guilty,as,when,she,was,ten,and,had,thrown,a,buttered,biscuit,at,suellen,at,the,table,<END>
to,think,of,her,gentle,mother,reproving,her,so,harshly,and,her,father,coming,to,town,to,talk,to,captain,butler,<END>
the,real,seriousness,of,the,matter,grew,on,her,<END>
gerald,was,going,to,be,severe,<END>
this,was,one,time,when,she,knew,she,couldn't,wiggle,out,of,her,punishment,by,sitting,on,his,knee,and,being,sweet,and,pert,<END>
not,not,bad,news,<END>
quavered,pittypat,<END>
pa,is,coming,tomorrow,and,he's,going,to,land,on,me,like,a,duck,on,a,june,bug,answered,scarlett,dolorously,<END>
prissy,find,my,salts,fluttered,pittypat,pushing,back,her,chair,from,her,half-eaten,meal,<END>
i,i,feel,faint,<END>
dey's,in,yo',skirt,pocket,said,prissy,who,had,been,hovering,behind,scarlett,enjoying,the,sensational,drama,<END>
mist',gerald,in,a,temper,was,always,exciting,providing,his,temper,was,not,directed,at,her,kinky,head,<END>
pitty,fumbled,at,her,skirt,and,held,the,vial,to,her,nose,<END>
you,all,must,stand,by,me,and,not,leave,me,alone,with,him,for,one,minute,cried,scarlett,<END>
he's,so,fond,of,you,both,and,if,you,are,with,me,he,can't,fuss,at,me,<END>
i,couldn't,said,pittypat,weakly,rising,to,her,feet,<END>
i,i,feel,ill,i,must,go,lie,down,<END>
i,shall,lie,down,all,day,tomorrow,<END>
you,must,give,him,my,excuses,<END>
coward,<END>
thought,scarlett,glowering,at,her,<END>
melly,rallied,to,the,defense,though,white,and,frightened,at,the,prospect,of,facing,the,fire-eating,mr,o'hara,<END>
i'll,i'll,help,you,explain,how,you,did,it,for,the,hospital,<END>
surely,he'll,understand,<END>
no,he,won't,said,scarlett,<END>
and,oh,i,shall,die,if,i,have,to,go,back,to,tara,in,disgrace,like,mother,threatens,<END>
oh,you,can't,go,home,cried,pittypat,bursting,into,tears,<END>
if,you,did,i,should,be,forced,yes,forced,to,ask,henry,to,come,live,with,us,and,you,know,i,just,couldn't,live,with,henry,<END>
i'm,so,nervous,with,just,melly,in,the,house,at,night,with,so,many,strange,men,in,town,<END>
you're,so,brave,i,don't,mind,being,here,without,a,man,<END>
oh,he,couldn't,take,you,to,tara,<END>
said,melly,looking,as,if,she,too,would,cry,in,a,moment,<END>
this,is,your,home,now,<END>
what,would,we,ever,do,without,you,<END>
you'd,be,glad,to,do,without,me,if,you,knew,what,i,really,think,of,you,thought,scarlett,sourly,wishing,there,were,some,other,person,than,melanie,to,help,ward,off,gerald's,wrath,<END>
it,was,sickening,to,be,defended,by,someone,you,disliked,so,much,<END>
perhaps,we,should,recall,our,invitation,to,captain,butler,began,pittypat,<END>
oh,we,couldn't,<END>
it,would,be,the,height,of,rudeness,<END>
cried,melly,distressed,<END>
help,me,to,bed,<END>
i'm,going,to,be,ill,moaned,pittypat,<END>
oh,scarlett,how,could,you,have,brought,this,on,me,<END>
pittypat,was,ill,and,in,her,bed,when,gerald,arrived,the,next,afternoon,<END>
she,sent,many,messages,of,regret,to,him,from,behind,her,closed,door,and,left,the,two,frightened,girls,to,preside,over,the,supper,table,<END>
gerald,was,ominously,silent,although,he,kissed,scarlett,and,pinched,melanie's,cheek,approvingly,and,called,her,cousin,melly,<END>
scarlett,would,have,infinitely,preferred,bellowing,oaths,and,accusations,<END>
true,to,her,promise,melanie,clung,to,scarlett's,skirts,like,a,small,rustling,shadow,and,gerald,was,too,much,of,a,gentleman,to,upbraid,his,daughter,in,front,of,her,<END>
scarlett,had,to,admit,that,melanie,carried,off,things,very,well,acting,as,if,she,knew,nothing,was,amiss,and,she,actually,succeeded,in,engaging,gerald,in,conversation,once,the,supper,had,been,served,<END>
i,want,to,know,all,about,the,county,she,said,beaming,upon,him,<END>
india,and,honey,are,such,poor,correspondents,and,i,know,you,know,everything,that,goes,on,down,there,<END>
do,tell,us,about,joe,fontaine's,wedding,<END>
gerald,warmed,to,the,flattery,and,said,that,the,wedding,had,been,a,quiet,affair,not,like,you,girls,had,for,joe,had,only,a,few,days',furlough,<END>
sally,the,little,munroe,chit,looked,very,pretty,<END>
no,he,couldn't,recall,what,she,wore,but,he,did,hear,that,she,didn't,have,a,second-day,dress,<END>
she,didn't,<END>
exclaimed,the,girls,scandalized,<END>
sure,because,she,didn't,have,a,second,day,gerald,explained,and,bawled,with,laughter,before,recalling,that,perhaps,such,remarks,were,not,fit,for,female,ears,<END>
scarlett's,spirits,soared,at,his,laugh,and,she,blessed,melanie's,tact,<END>
back,joe,went,to,virginia,the,next,day,gerald,added,hastily,<END>
there,was,no,visiting,about,and,dancing,afterwards,<END>
the,tarleton,twins,are,home,<END>
we,heard,that,<END>
have,they,recovered,<END>
they,weren't,badly,wounded,<END>
stuart,had,it,in,the,knee,and,a,minie,ball,went,through,brent's,shoulder,<END>
you,had,it,too,that,they,were,mentioned,in,dispatches,for,bravery,<END>
no,<END>
tell,us,<END>
hare,brained,both,of,them,<END>
i'm,believing,there's,irish,in,them,said,gerald,complacently,<END>
i,forget,what,they,did,but,brent,is,a,lieutenant,now,<END>
scarlett,felt,pleased,at,hearing,of,their,exploits,pleased,in,a,proprietary,manner,<END>
once,a,man,had,been,her,beau,she,never,lost,the,conviction,that,he,belonged,to,her,and,all,his,good,deeds,redounded,to,her,credit,<END>
and,i've,news,that'll,be,holding,the,both,of,you,said,gerald,<END>
they're,saying,stu,is,courting,at,twelve,oaks,again,<END>
honey,or,india,<END>
questioned,melly,excitedly,while,scarlett,stared,almost,indignantly,<END>
oh,miss,india,to,be,sure,<END>
didn't,she,have,him,fast,till,this,baggage,of,mine,winked,at,him,<END>
oh,said,melly,somewhat,embarrassed,at,gerald's,outspokenness,<END>
and,more,than,that,young,brent,has,taken,to,hanging,about,tara,<END>
now,<END>
scarlett,could,not,speak,<END>
the,defection,of,her,beaux,was,almost,insulting,<END>
especially,when,she,recalled,how,wildly,both,the,twins,had,acted,when,she,told,them,she,was,going,to,marry,charles,<END>
stuart,had,even,threatened,to,shoot,charles,or,scarlett,or,himself,or,all,three,<END>
it,had,been,most,exciting,<END>
suellen,<END>
questioned,melly,breaking,into,a,pleased,smile,<END>
but,i,thought,mr,kennedy,<END>
oh,him,<END>
said,gerald,<END>
frank,kennedy,still,pussyfoots,about,afraid,of,his,shadow,and,i'll,be,asking,him,his,intentions,soon,if,he,doesn't,speak,up,<END>
no,'tis,me,baby,<END>
carreen,<END>
she's,nothing,but,a,child,<END>
said,scarlett,sharply,finding,her,tongue,<END>
she's,little,more,than,a,year,younger,than,you,were,miss,when,you,were,married,retorted,gerald,<END>
is,it,you're,grudging,your,old,beau,to,your,sister,<END>
melly,blushed,unaccustomed,to,such,frankness,and,signaled,peter,to,bring,in,the,sweet,potato,pie,<END>
frantically,she,cast,about,in,her,mind,for,some,other,topic,of,conversation,which,would,not,be,so,personal,but,which,would,divert,mr,o'hara,from,the,purpose,of,his,trip,<END>
she,could,think,of,nothing,but,once,started,gerald,needed,no,stimulus,other,than,an,audience,<END>
he,talked,on,about,the,thievery,of,the,commissary,department,which,every,month,increased,its,demands,the,knavish,stupidity,of,jefferson,davis,and,the,blackguardery,of,the,irish,who,were,being,enticed,into,the,yankee,army,by,bounty,money,<END>
when,the,wine,was,on,the,table,and,the,two,girls,rose,to,leave,him,gerald,cocked,a,severe,eye,at,his,daughter,from,under,frowning,brows,and,commanded,her,presence,alone,for,a,few,minutes,<END>
scarlett,cast,a,despairing,glance,at,melly,who,twisted,her,handkerchief,helplessly,and,went,out,softly,pulling,the,sliding,doors,together,<END>
how,now,missy,<END>
bawled,gerald,pouring,himself,a,glass,of,port,<END>
'tis,a,fine,way,to,act,<END>
is,it,another,husband,you're,trying,to,catch,and,you,so,fresh,a,widow,<END>
not,so,loud,pa,the,servants,<END>
they,know,already,to,be,sure,and,everybody,knows,of,our,disgrace,<END>
and,your,poor,mother,taking,to,her,bed,with,it,and,me,not,able,to,hold,up,me,head,<END>
'tis,shameful,<END>
no,puss,you,need,not,think,to,get,around,me,with,tears,this,time,he,said,hastily,and,with,some,panic,in,his,voice,as,scarlett's,lids,began,to,bat,and,her,mouth,to,screw,up,<END>
i,know,you,<END>
you'd,be,flirting,at,the,wake,of,your,husband,<END>
don't,cry,<END>
there,i'll,be,saying,no,more,tonight,for,i'm,going,to,see,this,fine,captain,butler,who,makes,so,light,of,me,daughter's,reputation,<END>
but,in,the,morning,there,now,don't,cry,<END>
twill,do,you,no,good,at,all,at,all,<END>
'tis,firm,that,i,am,and,back,to,tara,you'll,be,going,tomorrow,before,you're,disgracing,the,lot,of,us,again,<END>
don't,cry,pet,<END>
look,what,i've,brought,you,<END>
isn't,that,a,pretty,present,<END>
see,look,<END>
how,could,you,be,putting,so,much,trouble,on,me,bringing,me,all,the,way,up,here,when,'tis,a,busy,man,i,am,<END>
don't,cry,<END>
melanie,and,pittypat,had,gone,to,sleep,hours,before,but,scarlett,lay,awake,in,the,warm,darkness,her,heart,heavy,and,frightened,in,her,breast,<END>
to,leave,atlanta,when,life,had,just,begun,again,and,go,home,and,face,ellen,<END>
she,would,rather,die,than,face,her,mother,<END>
she,wished,she,were,dead,this,very,minute,then,everyone,would,be,sorry,they,had,been,so,hateful,<END>
she,turned,and,tossed,on,the,hot,pillow,until,a,noise,far,up,the,quiet,street,reached,her,ears,<END>
it,was,an,oddly,familiar,noise,blurred,and,indistinct,though,it,was,<END>
she,slipped,out,of,bed,and,went,to,the,window,<END>
the,street,with,its,over-arching,trees,was,softly,deeply,black,under,a,dim,star-studded,sky,<END>
the,noise,came,closer,the,sound,of,wheels,the,plod,of,a,horse's,hooves,and,voices,<END>
and,suddenly,she,grinned,for,as,a,voice,thick,with,brogue,and,whisky,came,to,her,raised,in,peg,in,a,low-backed,car,she,knew,<END>
this,might,not,be,jonesboro,on,court,day,but,gerald,was,coming,home,in,the,same,condition,<END>
she,saw,the,dark,bulk,of,a,buggy,stop,in,front,of,the,house,and,indistinct,figures,alight,<END>
someone,was,with,him,<END>
two,figures,paused,at,the,gate,and,she,heard,the,click,of,the,latch,and,gerald's,voice,came,plain,<END>
now,i'll,be,giving,you,the,'lament,for,robert,emmet,',<END>
'tis,a,song,you,should,be,knowing,me,lad,<END>
i'll,teach,it,to,you,<END>
i'd,like,to,learn,it,replied,his,companion,a,hint,of,buried,laughter,in,his,flat,drawling,voice,<END>
but,not,now,mr,<END>
o'hara,<END>
oh,my,god,it's,that,hateful,butler,man,<END>
thought,scarlett,at,first,annoyed,<END>
then,she,took,heart,<END>
at,least,they,hadn't,shot,each,other,<END>
and,they,must,be,on,amicable,terms,to,be,coming,home,together,at,this,hour,and,in,this,condition,<END>
sing,it,i,will,and,listen,you,will,or,i'll,be,shooting,you,for,the,orangeman,you,are,<END>
not,orangeman,charlestonian,<END>
'tis,no,better,<END>
'tis,worse,<END>
i,have,two,sister-in-laws,in,charleston,and,i,know,<END>
is,he,going,to,tell,the,whole,neighborhood,<END>
thought,scarlett,panic-stricken,reaching,for,her,wrapper,<END>
but,what,could,she,do,<END>
she,couldn't,go,downstairs,at,this,hour,of,the,night,and,drag,her,father,in,from,the,street,<END>
with,no,further,warning,gerald,who,was,hanging,on,the,gate,threw,back,his,head,and,began,the,lament,in,a,roaring,bass,<END>
scarlett,rested,her,elbows,on,the,window,sill,and,listened,grinning,unwillingly,<END>
it,would,be,a,beautiful,song,if,only,her,father,could,carry,a,tune,<END>
it,was,one,of,her,favorite,songs,and,for,a,moment,she,followed,the,fine,melancholy,of,those,verses,beginning,<END>
she,is,far,from,the,land,where,her,young,hero,sleeps,and,lovers,are,round,her,sighing,<END>
the,song,went,on,and,she,heard,stirrings,in,pittypat's,and,melly's,rooms,<END>
poor,things,they'd,certainly,be,upset,<END>
they,were,not,used,to,full-blooded,males,like,gerald,<END>
when,the,song,had,finished,two,forms,merged,into,one,came,up,the,walk,and,mounted,the,steps,<END>
a,discreet,knock,sounded,at,the,door,<END>
i,suppose,i,must,go,down,thought,scarlett,<END>
after,all,he's,my,father,and,poor,pitty,would,die,before,she'd,go,<END>
besides,she,didn't,want,the,servants,to,see,gerald,in,his,present,condition,<END>
and,if,peter,tried,to,put,him,to,bed,he,might,get,unruly,<END>
pork,was,the,only,one,who,knew,how,to,handle,him,<END>
she,pinned,the,wrapper,close,about,her,throat,lit,her,bedside,candle,and,hurried,down,the,dark,stairs,into,the,front,hall,<END>
setting,the,candle,on,the,stand,she,unlocked,the,door,and,in,the,wavering,light,she,saw,rhett,butler,not,a,ruffle,disarranged,supporting,her,small,thickset,father,<END>
the,lament,had,evidently,been,gerald's,swan,song,for,he,was,frankly,hanging,onto,his,companion's,arm,<END>
his,hat,was,gone,his,crisp,long,hair,was,tumbled,in,a,white,mane,his,cravat,was,under,one,ear,and,there,were,liquor,stains,down,his,shirt,bosom,<END>
your,father,i,believe,<END>
said,captain,butler,his,eyes,amused,in,his,swarthy,face,<END>
he,took,in,her,dishabille,in,one,glance,that,seemed,to,penetrate,through,her,wrapper,<END>
bring,him,in,she,said,shortly,embarrassed,at,her,attire,infuriated,at,gerald,for,putting,her,in,a,position,where,this,man,could,laugh,at,her,<END>
rhett,propelled,gerald,forward,<END>
shall,i,help,you,take,him,upstairs,<END>
you,cannot,manage,him,<END>
he's,quite,heavy,<END>
her,mouth,fell,open,with,horror,at,the,audacity,of,his,proposal,<END>
just,imagine,what,pittypat,and,melly,cowering,in,their,beds,would,think,should,captain,butler,come,upstairs,<END>

no,<END>
he's,slept,in,them,before,<END>
she,could,have,bitten,off,her,tongue,for,that,slip,for,he,laughed,softly,as,he,crossed,gerald's,legs,<END>
please,go,now,<END>
he,walked,out,into,the,dim,hall,and,picked,up,the,hat,he,had,dropped,on,the,doorsill,<END>
i,will,be,seeing,you,sunday,at,dinner,he,said,and,went,out,closing,the,door,noiselessly,behind,him,<END>
scarlett,arose,at,five-thirty,before,the,servants,had,come,in,from,the,back,yard,to,start,breakfast,and,slipped,down,the,steps,to,the,quiet,lower,floor,<END>
gerald,was,awake,sitting,on,the,sofa,his,hands,gripping,his,bullet,head,as,if,he,wished,to,crush,it,between,his,palms,<END>
he,looked,up,furtively,as,she,entered,<END>
the,pain,of,moving,his,eyes,was,too,excruciating,to,be,borne,and,he,groaned,<END>
wurra,the,day,<END>
it's,a,fine,way,you've,acted,pa,she,began,in,a,furious,whisper,<END>
coming,home,at,such,an,hour,and,waking,all,the,neighbors,with,your,singing,<END>

she,went,back,toward,her,father,with,the,reviving,liquor,thanking,heaven,that,the,famous,o'hara,head,had,not,been,able,to,survive,last,night's,bout,and,wondering,suddenly,if,rhett,butler,had,had,anything,to,do,with,that,<END>
chapter,xi,<END>
on,an,afternoon,of,the,following,week,scarlett,came,home,from,the,hospital,weary,and,indignant,<END>
she,was,tired,from,standing,on,her,feet,all,morning,and,irritable,because,mrs,merriwether,had,scolded,her,sharply,for,sitting,on,a,soldier's,bed,while,she,dressed,his,wounded,arm,<END>
aunt,pitty,and,melanie,bonneted,in,their,best,were,on,the,porch,with,wade,and,prissy,ready,for,their,weekly,round,of,calls,<END>
scarlett,asked,to,be,excused,from,accompanying,them,and,went,upstairs,to,her,room,<END>
when,the,last,sound,of,carriage,wheels,had,died,away,and,she,knew,the,family,was,safely,out,of,sight,she,slipped,quietly,into,melanie's,room,and,turned,the,key,in,the,lock,<END>
it,was,a,prim,virginal,little,room,and,it,lay,still,and,warm,in,the,slanting,rays,of,the,four-o'clock,sun,<END>
the,floors,were,glistening,and,bare,except,for,a,few,bright,rag,rugs,and,the,white,walls,unornamented,save,for,one,corner,which,melanie,had,fitted,up,as,a,shrine,<END>
here,under,a,draped,confederate,flag,hung,the,gold-hilted,saber,that,melanie's,father,had,carried,in,the,mexican,war,the,same,saber,charles,had,worn,away,to,war,<END>
charles',sash,and,pistol,belt,hung,there,too,with,his,revolver,in,the,holster,<END>
between,the,saber,and,the,pistol,was,a,daguerreotype,of,charles,himself,very,stiff,and,proud,in,his,gray,uniform,his,great,brown,eyes,shining,out,of,the,frame,and,a,shy,smile,on,his,lips,<END>
scarlett,did,not,even,glance,at,the,picture,but,went,unhesitatingly,across,the,room,to,the,square,rosewood,writing,box,that,stood,on,the,table,beside,the,narrow,bed,<END>
from,it,she,took,a,pack,of,letters,tied,together,with,a,blue,ribbon,addressed,in,ashley's,hand,to,melanie,<END>
on,the,top,was,the,letter,which,had,come,that,morning,and,this,one,she,opened,<END>
when,scarlett,first,began,secretly,reading,these,letters,she,had,been,so,stricken,of,conscience,and,so,fearful,of,discovery,she,could,hardly,open,the,envelopes,for,trembling,<END>
now,her,never-,too-scrupulous,sense,of,honor,was,dulled,by,repetition,of,the,offense,and,even,fear,of,discovery,had,subsided,<END>
occasionally,she,thought,with,a,sinking,heart,what,would,mother,say,if,she,knew,<END>
she,knew,ellen,would,rather,see,her,dead,than,know,her,guilty,of,such,dishonor,<END>
this,had,worried,scarlett,at,first,for,she,still,wanted,to,be,like,her,mother,in,every,respect,<END>
but,the,temptation,to,read,the,letters,was,too,great,and,she,put,the,thought,of,ellen,out,of,her,mind,<END>
she,had,become,adept,at,putting,unpleasant,thoughts,out,of,her,mind,these,days,<END>
she,had,learned,to,say,i,won't,think,of,this,or,that,bothersome,thought,now,<END>
i'll,think,about,it,tomorrow,<END>
generally,when,tomorrow,came,the,thought,either,did,not,occur,at,all,or,it,was,so,attenuated,by,the,delay,it,was,not,very,troublesome,<END>
so,the,matter,of,ashley's,letters,did,not,lie,very,heavily,on,her,conscience,<END>
melanie,was,always,generous,with,the,letters,reading,parts,of,them,aloud,to,aunt,pitty,and,scarlett,<END>
but,it,was,the,part,she,did,not,read,that,tormented,scarlett,that,drove,her,to,surreptitious,reading,of,her,sister-in-law's,mail,<END>
she,had,to,know,if,ashley,had,come,to,love,his,wife,since,marrying,her,<END>
she,had,to,know,if,he,even,pretended,to,love,her,<END>
did,he,address,tender,endearments,to,her,<END>
what,sentiments,did,he,express,and,with,what,warmth,<END>
she,carefully,smoothed,out,the,letter,<END>
ashley's,small,even,writing,leaped,up,at,her,as,she,read,my,dear,wife,and,she,breathed,in,relief,<END>

for,melanie,bugles,do,not,stir,my,blood,nor,drums,entice,my,feet,and,i,see,too,clearly,that,we,have,been,betrayed,betrayed,by,our,arrogant,southern,selves,believing,that,one,of,us,could,whip,a,dozen,yankees,believing,that,king,cotton,could,rule,the,world,<END>

and,so,when,i,lie,on,my,blanket,and,look,up,at,the,stars,and,say,'what,are,you,fighting,for,',<END>
i,think,of,states',rights,and,cotton,and,the,darkies,and,the,yankees,whom,we,have,been,bred,to,hate,and,i,know,that,none,of,these,is,the,reason,why,i,am,fighting,<END>
instead,i,see,twelve,oaks,and,remember,how,the,moonlight,slants,across,the,white,columns,and,the,unearthly,way,the,magnolias,look,opening,under,the,moon,and,how,the,climbing,roses,make,the,side,porch,shady,even,at,the,hottest,noon,<END>

and,there's,the,long,view,down,the,road,to,the,river,across,the,cotton,fields,and,the,mist,rising,from,the,bottom,lands,in,the,twilight,<END>
and,that,is,why,i'm,here,who,have,no,love,of,death,or,misery,or,glory,and,no,hatred,for,anyone,<END>
perhaps,that,is,what,is,called,patriotism,love,of,home,and,country,<END>

besides,the,tone,of,the,letter,vaguely,depressed,her,with,its,foolish,talk,of,defeat,<END>
after,all,she,wasn't,reading,melanie's,mail,to,learn,ashley's,puzzling,and,uninteresting,ideas,<END>
she,had,had,to,listen,to,enough,of,them,when,he,sat,on,the,porch,at,tara,in,days,gone,by,<END>

she,had,read,every,letter,in,the,writing,box,and,there,was,nothing,in,any,one,of,them,that,a,brother,might,not,have,written,to,a,sister,<END>
they,were,affectionate,humorous,discursive,but,not,the,letters,of,a,lover,<END>
scarlett,had,received,too,many,ardent,love,letters,herself,not,to,recognize,the,authentic,note,of,passion,when,she,saw,it,<END>

melanie,evidently,found,nothing,lacking,in,her,husband's,messages,but,melanie,had,had,no,other,man's,love,letters,with,which,to,compare,ashley's,<END>

if,ever,any,husband,of,mine,wrote,me,such,twaddle-twaddle,he'd,certainly,hear,from,me,<END>
why,even,charlie,wrote,better,letters,than,these,<END>
she,flipped,back,the,edges,of,the,letters,looking,at,the,dates,remembering,their,contents,<END>
in,them,there,were,no,fine,descriptive,pages,of,bivouacs,and,charges,such,as,darcy,meade,wrote,his,parents,or,poor,dallas,mclure,had,written,his,old-maid,sisters,misses,faith,and,hope,<END>
the,meades,and,mclures,proudly,read,these,letters,all,over,the,neighborhood,and,scarlett,had,frequently,felt,a,secret,shame,that,melanie,had,no,such,letters,from,ashley,to,read,aloud,at,sewing,circles,<END>
it,was,as,though,when,writing,melanie,ashley,tried,to,ignore,the,war,altogether,and,sought,to,draw,about,the,two,of,them,a,magic,circle,of,timelessness,shutting,out,everything,that,had,happened,since,fort,sumter,was,the,news,of,the,day,<END>
it,was,almost,as,if,he,were,trying,to,believe,there,wasn't,any,war,<END>
he,wrote,of,books,which,he,and,melanie,had,read,and,songs,they,had,sung,of,old,friends,they,knew,and,places,he,had,visited,on,his,grand,tour,<END>
through,the,letters,ran,a,wistful,yearning,to,be,back,home,at,twelve,oaks,and,for,pages,he,wrote,of,the,hunting,and,the,long,rides,through,the,still,forest,paths,under,frosty,autumn,stars,the,barbecues,the,fish,fries,the,quiet,of,moonlight,nights,and,the,serene,charm,of,the,old,house,<END>
she,thought,of,his,words,in,the,letter,she,had,just,read,not,this,<END>
never,this,<END>
and,they,seemed,to,cry,of,a,tormented,soul,facing,something,he,could,not,face,yet,must,face,<END>
it,puzzled,her,for,if,he,was,not,afraid,of,wounds,and,death,what,was,it,he,feared,<END>

the,war,disturbs,him,and,he,he,doesn't,like,things,that,disturb,him,<END>

once,he's,made,up,his,mind,to,do,something,no,one,could,be,braver,or,more,determined,but,he,lives,inside,his,head,instead,of,outside,in,the,world,and,he,hates,to,come,out,into,the,world,and,oh,i,don't,know,what,it,is,<END>
if,i'd,just,understood,this,one,thing,about,him,years,ago,i,know,he'd,have,married,me,<END>

her,love,was,still,a,young,girl's,adoration,for,a,man,she,could,not,understand,a,man,who,possessed,all,the,qualities,she,did,not,own,but,which,she,admired,<END>
he,was,still,a,young,girl's,dream,of,the,perfect,knight,and,her,dream,asked,no,more,than,acknowledgment,of,his,love,went,no,further,than,hopes,of,a,kiss,<END>

had,charles,with,his,fumbling,awkwardness,and,his,embarrassed,intimacies,tapped,any,of,the,deep,vein,of,passionate,feeling,within,her,her,dreams,of,ashley,would,not,be,ending,with,a,kiss,<END>
but,those,few,moonlight,nights,alone,with,charles,had,not,touched,her,emotions,or,ripened,her,to,maturity,<END>
charles,had,awakened,no,idea,of,what,passion,might,be,or,tenderness,or,true,intimacy,of,body,or,spirit,<END>
all,that,passion,meant,to,her,was,servitude,to,inexplicable,male,madness,unshared,by,females,a,painful,and,embarrassing,process,that,led,inevitably,to,the,still,more,painful,process,of,childbirth,<END>
that,marriage,should,be,like,this,was,no,surprise,to,her,<END>
ellen,had,hinted,before,the,wedding,that,marriage,was,something,women,must,bear,with,dignity,and,fortitude,and,the,whispered,comments,of,other,matrons,since,her,widowhood,had,confirmed,this,<END>
scarlett,was,glad,to,be,done,with,passion,and,marriage,<END>
she,was,done,with,marriage,but,not,with,love,for,her,love,for,ashley,was,something,different,having,nothing,to,do,with,passion,or,marriage,something,sacred,and,breathtakingly,beautiful,an,emotion,that,grew,stealthily,through,the,long,days,of,her,enforced,silence,feeding,on,oft-thumbed,memories,and,hopes,<END>
she,sighed,as,she,carefully,tied,the,ribbon,about,the,packet,wondering,for,the,thousandth,time,just,what,it,was,in,ashley,that,eluded,her,understanding,<END>
she,tried,to,think,the,matter,to,some,satisfactory,conclusion,but,as,always,the,conclusion,evaded,her,uncomplex,mind,<END>
she,put,the,letters,back,in,the,lap,secretary,and,closed,the,lid,<END>
then,she,frowned,for,her,mind,went,back,to,the,last,part,of,the,letter,she,had,just,read,to,his,mention,of,captain,butler,<END>
how,strange,that,ashley,should,be,impressed,by,something,that,scamp,had,said,a,year,ago,<END>
undeniably,captain,butler,was,a,scamp,for,all,that,he,danced,divinely,<END>
no,one,but,a,scamp,would,say,the,things,about,the,confederacy,that,he,had,said,at,the,bazaar,<END>
she,crossed,the,room,to,the,mirror,and,patted,her,smooth,hair,approvingly,<END>
her,spirits,rose,as,always,at,the,sight,of,her,white,skin,and,slanting,green,eyes,and,she,smiled,to,bring,out,her,dimples,<END>
then,she,dismissed,captain,butler,from,her,mind,as,she,happily,viewed,her,reflection,remembering,how,ashley,had,always,liked,her,dimples,<END>
no,pang,of,conscience,at,loving,another,woman's,husband,or,reading,that,woman's,mail,disturbed,her,pleasure,in,her,youth,and,charm,and,her,renewed,assurance,of,ashley's,love,<END>
she,unlocked,the,door,and,went,down,the,dim,winding,stair,with,a,light,heart,<END>
halfway,down,she,began,singing,when,this,cruel,war,is,over,<END>
chapter,xii,<END>
the,war,went,on,successfully,for,the,most,part,but,people,had,stopped,saying,one,more,victory,and,the,war,is,over,just,as,they,had,stopped,saying,the,yankees,were,cowards,<END>
it,was,obvious,to,all,now,that,the,yankees,were,far,from,cowardly,and,that,it,would,take,more,than,one,victory,to,conquer,them,<END>
however,there,were,the,confederate,victories,in,tennessee,scored,by,general,morgan,and,general,forrest,and,the,triumph,at,the,second,battle,of,bull,run,hung,up,like,visible,yankee,scalps,to,gloat,over,<END>
but,there,was,a,heavy,price,on,these,scalps,<END>
the,hospitals,and,homes,of,atlanta,were,overflowing,with,the,sick,and,wounded,and,more,and,more,women,were,appearing,in,black,<END>
the,monotonous,rows,of,soldiers',graves,at,oakland,cemetery,stretched,longer,every,day,<END>
confederate,money,had,dropped,alarmingly,and,the,price,of,food,and,clothing,had,risen,accordingly,<END>
the,commissary,was,laying,such,heavy,levies,on,foodstuffs,that,the,tables,of,atlanta,were,beginning,to,suffer,<END>
white,flour,was,scarce,and,so,expensive,that,corn,bread,was,universal,instead,of,biscuits,rolls,and,waffles,<END>
the,butcher,shops,carried,almost,no,beef,and,very,little,mutton,and,that,mutton,cost,so,much,only,the,rich,could,afford,it,<END>
however,there,was,still,plenty,of,hog,meat,as,well,as,chickens,and,vegetables,<END>
the,yankee,blockade,about,the,confederate,ports,had,tightened,and,luxuries,such,as,tea,coffee,silks,whalebone,stays,colognes,fashion,magazines,and,books,were,scarce,and,dear,<END>
even,the,cheapest,cotton,goods,had,skyrocketed,in,price,and,ladies,were,regretfully,making,their,old,dresses,do,another,season,<END>
looms,that,had,gathered,dust,for,years,had,been,brought,down,from,attics,and,there,were,webs,of,homespun,to,be,found,in,nearly,every,parlor,<END>
everyone,soldiers,civilians,women,children,and,negroes,began,to,wear,homespun,<END>
gray,as,the,color,of,the,confederate,uniform,practically,disappeared,and,homespun,of,a,butternut,shade,took,its,place,<END>
already,the,hospitals,were,worrying,about,the,scarcity,of,quinine,calomel,opium,chloroform,and,iodine,<END>
linen,and,cotton,bandages,were,too,precious,now,to,be,thrown,away,when,used,and,every,lady,who,nursed,at,the,hospitals,brought,home,baskets,of,bloody,strips,to,be,washed,and,ironed,and,returned,for,use,on,other,sufferers,<END>
but,to,scarlett,newly,emerged,from,the,chrysalis,of,widowhood,all,the,war,meant,was,a,time,of,gaiety,and,excitement,<END>
even,the,small,privations,of,clothing,and,food,did,not,annoy,her,so,happy,was,she,to,be,in,the,world,again,<END>
when,she,thought,of,the,dull,times,of,the,past,year,with,the,days,going,by,one,very,much,like,another,life,seemed,to,have,quickened,to,an,incredible,speed,<END>
every,day,dawned,as,an,exciting,adventure,a,day,in,which,she,would,meet,new,men,who,would,ask,to,call,on,her,tell,her,how,pretty,she,was,and,how,it,was,a,privilege,to,fight,and,perhaps,to,die,for,her,<END>
she,could,and,did,love,ashley,with,the,last,breath,in,her,body,but,that,did,not,prevent,her,from,inveigling,other,men,into,asking,to,marry,her,<END>
the,ever-present,war,in,the,background,lent,a,pleasant,informality,to,social,relations,an,informality,which,older,people,viewed,with,alarm,<END>
mothers,found,strange,men,calling,on,their,daughters,men,who,came,without,letters,of,introduction,and,whose,antecedents,were,unknown,<END>
to,their,horror,mothers,found,their,daughters,holding,hands,with,these,men,<END>
mrs,merriwether,who,had,never,kissed,her,husband,until,after,the,wedding,ceremony,could,scarcely,believe,her,eyes,when,she,caught,maybelle,kissing,the,little,zouave,rene,picard,and,her,consternation,was,even,greater,when,maybelle,refused,to,be,ashamed,<END>
even,the,fact,that,rene,immediately,asked,for,her,hand,did,not,improve,matters,<END>
mrs,merriwether,felt,that,the,south,was,heading,for,a,complete,moral,collapse,and,frequently,said,so,<END>
other,mothers,concurred,heartily,with,her,and,blamed,it,on,the,war,<END>
but,men,who,expected,to,die,within,a,week,or,a,month,could,not,wait,a,year,before,they,begged,to,call,a,girl,by,her,first,name,with,miss,of,course,preceding,it,<END>
nor,would,they,go,through,the,formal,and,protracted,courtships,which,good,manners,had,prescribed,before,the,war,<END>
they,were,likely,to,propose,in,three,or,four,months,<END>
and,girls,who,knew,very,well,that,a,lady,always,refused,a,gentleman,the,first,three,times,he,proposed,rushed,headlong,to,accept,the,first,time,<END>
this,informality,made,the,war,a,lot,of,fun,for,scarlett,<END>
except,for,the,messy,business,of,nursing,and,the,bore,of,bandage,rolling,she,did,not,care,if,the,war,lasted,forever,<END>
in,fact,she,could,endure,the,hospital,with,equanimity,now,because,it,was,a,perfect,happy,hunting,ground,<END>
the,helpless,wounded,succumbed,to,her,charms,without,a,struggle,<END>
renew,their,bandages,wash,their,faces,pat,up,their,pillows,and,fan,them,and,they,fell,in,love,<END>
oh,it,was,heaven,after,the,last,dreary,year,<END>
scarlett,was,back,again,where,she,had,been,before,she,married,charles,and,it,was,as,if,she,had,never,married,him,never,felt,the,shock,of,his,death,never,borne,wade,<END>
war,and,marriage,and,childbirth,had,passed,over,her,without,touching,any,deep,chord,within,her,and,she,was,unchanged,<END>
she,had,a,child,but,he,was,cared,for,so,well,by,the,others,in,the,red,brick,house,she,could,almost,forget,him,<END>
in,her,mind,and,heart,she,was,scarlett,o'hara,again,the,belle,of,the,county,<END>
her,thoughts,and,activities,were,the,same,as,they,had,been,in,the,old,days,but,the,field,of,her,activities,had,widened,immensely,<END>
careless,of,the,disapproval,of,aunt,pitty's,friends,she,behaved,as,she,had,behaved,before,her,marriage,went,to,parties,danced,went,riding,with,soldiers,flirted,did,everything,she,had,done,as,a,girl,except,stop,wearing,mourning,<END>
this,she,knew,would,be,a,straw,that,would,break,the,backs,of,pittypat,and,melanie,<END>
she,was,as,charming,a,widow,as,she,had,been,a,girl,pleasant,when,she,had,her,own,way,obliging,as,long,as,it,did,not,discommode,her,vain,of,her,looks,and,her,popularity,<END>
she,was,happy,now,where,a,few,weeks,before,she,had,been,miserable,happy,with,her,beaux,and,their,reassurances,of,her,charm,as,happy,as,she,could,be,with,ashley,married,to,melanie,and,in,danger,<END>
but,somehow,it,was,easier,to,bear,the,thought,of,ashley,belonging,to,some,one,else,when,he,was,far,away,<END>
with,the,hundreds,of,miles,stretching,between,atlanta,and,virginia,he,sometimes,seemed,as,much,hers,as,melanie's,<END>
so,the,autumn,months,of,1862,went,swiftly,by,with,nursing,dancing,driving,and,bandage,rolling,taking,up,all,the,time,she,did,not,spend,on,brief,visits,to,tara,<END>
these,visits,were,disappointing,for,she,had,little,opportunity,for,the,long,quiet,talks,with,her,mother,to,which,she,looked,forward,while,in,atlanta,no,time,to,sit,by,ellen,while,she,sewed,smelling,the,faint,fragrance,of,lemon,verbena,sachet,as,her,skirts,rustled,feeling,her,soft,hands,on,her,cheek,in,a,gentle,caress,<END>
ellen,was,thin,and,preoccupied,now,and,on,her,feet,from,morning,until,long,after,the,plantation,was,asleep,<END>
the,demands,of,the,confederate,commissary,were,growing,heavier,by,the,month,and,hers,was,the,task,of,making,tara,produce,<END>
even,gerald,was,busy,for,the,first,time,in,many,years,for,he,could,get,no,overseer,to,take,jonas,wilkerson's,place,and,he,was,riding,his,own,acres,<END>
with,ellen,too,busy,for,more,than,a,goodnight,kiss,and,gerald,in,the,fields,all,day,scarlett,found,tara,boring,<END>
even,her,sisters,were,taken,up,with,their,own,concerns,<END>
suellen,had,now,come,to,an,understanding,with,frank,kennedy,and,sang,when,this,cruel,war,is,over,with,an,arch,meaning,scarlett,found,well-nigh,unendurable,and,carreen,was,too,wrapped,up,in,dreams,of,brent,tarleton,to,be,interesting,company,<END>
though,scarlett,always,went,home,to,tara,with,a,happy,heart,she,was,never,sorry,when,the,inevitable,letters,came,from,pitty,and,melanie,begging,her,to,return,<END>
ellen,always,sighed,at,these,times,saddened,by,the,thought,of,her,oldest,daughter,and,her,only,grandchild,leaving,her,<END>
but,i,mustn't,be,selfish,and,keep,you,here,when,you,are,needed,to,nurse,in,atlanta,she,said,<END>
only,only,my,darling,it,seems,that,i,never,get,the,time,to,talk,to,you,and,to,feel,that,you,are,my,own,little,girl,again,before,you,are,gone,from,me,<END>
i'm,always,your,little,girl,scarlett,would,say,and,bury,her,head,upon,ellen's,breast,her,guilt,rising,up,to,accuse,her,<END>
she,did,not,tell,her,mother,that,it,was,the,dancing,and,the,beaux,which,drew,her,back,to,atlanta,and,not,the,service,of,the,confederacy,<END>
there,were,many,things,she,kept,from,her,mother,these,days,<END>
but,most,of,all,she,kept,secret,the,fact,that,rhett,butler,called,frequently,at,aunt,pittypat's,house,<END>
during,the,months,that,followed,the,bazaar,rhett,called,whenever,he,was,in,town,taking,scarlett,riding,in,his,carriage,escorting,her,to,danceables,and,bazaars,and,waiting,outside,the,hospital,to,drive,her,home,<END>
she,lost,her,fear,of,his,betraying,her,secret,but,there,always,lurked,in,the,back,of,her,mind,the,disquieting,memory,that,he,had,seen,her,at,her,worst,and,knew,the,truth,about,ashley,<END>
it,was,this,knowledge,that,checked,her,tongue,when,he,annoyed,her,<END>
and,he,annoyed,her,frequently,<END>
he,was,in,his,mid-thirties,older,than,any,beau,she,had,ever,had,and,she,was,as,helpless,as,a,child,to,control,and,handle,him,as,she,had,handled,beaux,nearer,her,own,age,<END>
he,always,looked,as,if,nothing,had,ever,surprised,him,and,much,had,amused,him,and,when,he,had,gotten,her,into,a,speechless,temper,she,felt,that,she,amused,him,more,than,anything,in,the,world,<END>
frequently,she,flared,into,open,wrath,under,his,expert,baiting,for,she,had,gerald's,irish,temper,along,with,the,deceptive,sweetness,of,face,she,had,inherited,from,ellen,<END>
heretofore,she,had,never,bothered,to,control,her,temper,except,in,ellen's,presence,<END>
now,it,was,painful,to,have,to,choke,back,words,for,fear,of,his,amused,grin,<END>
if,only,he,would,ever,lose,his,temper,too,then,she,would,not,feel,at,such,a,disadvantage,<END>
after,tilts,with,him,from,which,she,seldom,emerged,the,victor,she,vowed,he,was,impossible,ill-bred,and,no,gentleman,and,she,would,have,nothing,more,to,do,with,him,<END>
but,sooner,or,later,he,returned,to,atlanta,called,presumably,on,aunt,pitty,and,presented,scarlett,with,overdone,gallantry,a,box,of,bonbons,he,had,brought,her,from,nassau,<END>
or,preempted,a,seat,by,her,at,a,musicale,or,claimed,her,at,a,dance,and,she,was,usually,so,amused,by,his,bland,impudence,that,she,laughed,and,overlooked,his,past,misdeeds,until,the,next,occurred,<END>
for,all,his,exasperating,qualities,she,grew,to,look,forward,to,his,calls,<END>
there,was,something,exciting,about,him,that,she,could,not,analyze,something,different,from,any,man,she,had,ever,known,<END>
there,was,something,breathtaking,in,the,grace,of,his,big,body,which,made,his,very,entrance,into,a,room,like,an,abrupt,physical,impact,something,in,the,impertinence,and,bland,mockery,of,his,dark,eyes,that,challenged,her,spirit,to,subdue,him,<END>
it's,almost,like,i,was,in,love,with,him,<END>
she,thought,bewildered,<END>
but,i'm,not,and,i,just,can't,understand,it,<END>
but,the,exciting,feeling,persisted,<END>
when,he,came,to,call,his,complete,masculinity,made,aunt,pitty's,well-bred,and,ladylike,house,seem,small,pale,and,a,trifle,fusty,<END>
scarlett,was,not,the,only,member,of,the,household,who,reacted,strangely,and,unwillingly,to,his,presence,for,he,kept,aunt,pitty,in,a,flutter,and,a,ferment,<END>
while,pitty,knew,ellen,would,disapprove,of,his,calls,on,her,daughter,and,knew,also,that,the,edict,of,charleston,banning,him,from,polite,society,was,not,one,to,be,lightly,disregarded,she,could,no,more,resist,his,elaborate,compliments,and,hand,kissing,than,a,fly,can,resist,a,honey,pot,<END>
moreover,he,usually,brought,her,some,little,gift,from,nassau,which,he,assured,her,he,had,purchased,especially,for,her,and,blockaded,in,at,risk,of,his,life,papers,of,pins,and,needles,buttons,spools,of,silk,thread,and,hairpins,<END>
it,was,almost,impossible,to,obtain,these,small,luxuries,now,ladies,were,wearing,hand-whittled,wooden,hairpins,and,covering,acorns,with,cloth,for,buttons,and,pitty,lacked,the,moral,stamina,to,refuse,them,<END>
besides,she,had,a,childish,love,of,surprise,packages,and,could,not,resist,opening,his,gifts,<END>
and,having,once,opened,them,she,did,not,feel,that,she,could,refuse,them,<END>
then,having,accepted,his,gifts,she,could,not,summon,courage,enough,to,tell,him,his,reputation,made,it,improper,for,him,to,call,on,three,lone,women,who,had,no,male,protector,<END>
aunt,pitty,always,felt,that,she,needed,a,male,protector,when,rhett,butler,was,in,the,house,<END>
i,don't,know,what,it,is,about,him,she,would,sigh,helplessly,<END>
but,well,i,think,he'd,be,a,nice,attractive,man,if,i,could,just,feel,that,well,that,deep,down,in,his,heart,he,respected,women,<END>
since,the,return,of,her,wedding,ring,melanie,had,felt,that,rhett,was,a,gentleman,of,rare,refinement,and,delicacy,and,she,was,shocked,at,this,remark,<END>
he,was,unfailingly,courteous,to,her,but,she,was,a,little,timid,with,him,largely,because,she,was,shy,with,any,man,she,had,not,known,from,childhood,<END>
secretly,she,was,very,sorry,for,him,a,feeling,which,would,have,amused,him,had,he,been,aware,of,it,<END>
she,was,certain,that,some,romantic,sorrow,had,blighted,his,life,and,made,him,hard,and,bitter,and,she,felt,that,what,he,needed,was,the,love,of,a,good,woman,<END>
in,all,her,sheltered,life,she,had,never,seen,evil,and,could,scarcely,credit,its,existence,and,when,gossip,whispered,things,about,rhett,and,the,girl,in,charleston,she,was,shocked,and,unbelieving,<END>
and,instead,of,turning,her,against,him,it,only,made,her,more,timidly,gracious,toward,him,because,of,her,indignation,at,what,she,fancied,was,a,gross,injustice,done,him,<END>
scarlett,silently,agreed,with,aunt,pitty,<END>
she,too,felt,that,he,had,no,respect,for,any,woman,unless,perhaps,for,melanie,<END>
she,still,felt,unclothed,every,time,his,eyes,ran,up,and,down,her,figure,<END>
it,was,not,that,he,ever,said,anything,<END>
then,she,could,have,scorched,him,with,hot,words,<END>
it,was,the,bold,way,his,eyes,looked,out,of,his,swarthy,face,with,a,displeasing,air,of,insolence,as,if,all,women,were,his,property,to,be,enjoyed,in,his,own,good,time,<END>
only,with,melanie,was,this,look,absent,<END>
there,was,never,that,cool,look,of,appraisal,never,mockery,in,his,eyes,when,he,looked,at,melanie,and,there,was,an,especial,note,in,his,voice,when,he,spoke,to,her,courteous,respectful,anxious,to,be,of,service,<END>
i,don't,see,why,you're,so,much,nicer,to,her,than,to,me,said,scarlett,petulantly,one,afternoon,when,melanie,and,pitty,had,retired,to,take,their,naps,and,she,was,alone,with,him,<END>
for,an,hour,she,had,watched,rhett,hold,the,yarn,melanie,was,winding,for,knitting,had,noted,the,blank,inscrutable,expression,when,melanie,talked,at,length,and,with,pride,of,ashley,and,his,promotion,<END>
scarlett,knew,rhett,had,no,exalted,opinion,of,ashley,and,cared,nothing,at,all,about,the,fact,that,he,had,been,made,a,major,<END>
yet,he,made,polite,replies,and,murmured,the,correct,things,about,ashley's,gallantry,<END>
and,if,i,so,much,as,mention,ashley's,name,she,had,thought,irritably,he,cocks,his,eyebrow,up,and,smiles,that,nasty,knowing,smile,<END>
i'm,much,prettier,than,she,is,she,continued,and,i,don't,see,why,you're,nicer,to,her,<END>
dare,i,hope,that,you,are,jealous,<END>
oh,don't,presume,<END>
another,hope,crushed,<END>
if,i,am,'nicer',to,mrs,wilkes,it,is,because,she,deserves,it,<END>
she,is,one,of,the,very,few,kind,sincere,and,unselfish,persons,i,have,ever,known,<END>
but,perhaps,you,have,failed,to,note,these,qualities,<END>
and,moreover,for,all,her,youth,she,is,one,of,the,few,great,ladies,i,have,ever,been,privileged,to,know,<END>
do,you,mean,to,say,you,don't,think,i'm,a,great,lady,too,<END>

oh,if,you,are,going,to,be,hateful,and,rude,enough,to,bring,that,up,again,<END>
how,can,you,hold,that,bit,of,childish,temper,against,me,<END>
that,was,so,long,ago,and,i've,grown,up,since,then,and,i'd,forget,all,about,it,if,you,weren't,always,harping,and,hinting,about,it,<END>

her,weapons,of,scorn,coldness,and,abuse,blunted,in,her,hands,for,nothing,she,could,say,would,shame,him,<END>

he,came,and,went,during,these,months,arriving,unheralded,and,leaving,without,saying,good-by,<END>
scarlett,never,discovered,just,what,business,brought,him,to,atlanta,for,few,other,blockaders,found,it,necessary,to,come,so,far,away,from,the,coast,<END>
they,landed,their,cargoes,at,wilmington,or,charleston,where,they,were,met,by,swarms,of,merchants,and,speculators,from,all,over,the,south,who,assembled,to,buy,blockaded,goods,at,auction,<END>
it,would,have,pleased,her,to,think,that,he,made,these,trips,to,see,her,but,even,her,abnormal,vanity,refused,to,believe,this,<END>
if,he,had,ever,once,made,love,to,her,seemed,jealous,of,the,other,men,who,crowded,about,her,even,tried,to,hold,her,hand,or,begged,for,a,picture,or,a,handkerchief,to,cherish,she,would,have,thought,triumphantly,he,had,been,caught,by,her,charms,<END>
but,he,remained,annoyingly,unloverlike,and,worst,of,all,seemed,to,see,through,all,her,maneuverings,to,bring,him,to,his,knees,<END>
whenever,he,came,to,town,there,was,a,feminine,fluttering,<END>
not,only,did,the,romantic,aura,of,the,dashing,blockader,hang,about,him,but,there,was,also,the,titillating,element,of,the,wicked,and,the,forbidden,<END>
he,had,such,a,bad,reputation,<END>
and,every,time,the,matrons,of,atlanta,gathered,together,to,gossip,his,reputation,grew,worse,which,only,made,him,all,the,more,glamorous,to,the,young,girls,<END>
as,most,of,them,were,quite,innocent,they,had,heard,little,more,than,that,he,was,quite,loose,with,women,and,exactly,how,a,man,went,about,the,business,of,being,loose,they,did,not,know,<END>
they,also,heard,whispers,that,no,girl,was,safe,with,him,<END>
with,such,a,reputation,it,was,strange,that,he,had,never,so,much,as,kissed,the,hand,of,an,unmarried,girl,since,he,first,appeared,in,atlanta,<END>
but,that,only,served,to,make,him,more,mysterious,and,more,exciting,<END>
outside,of,the,army,heroes,he,was,the,most,talked-about,man,in,atlanta,<END>
everyone,knew,in,detail,how,he,had,been,expelled,from,west,point,for,drunkenness,and,something,about,women,<END>
that,terrific,scandal,concerning,the,charleston,girl,he,had,compromised,and,the,brother,he,had,killed,was,public,property,<END>
correspondence,with,charleston,friends,elicited,the,further,information,that,his,father,a,charming,old,gentleman,with,an,iron,will,and,a,ramrod,for,a,backbone,had,cast,him,out,without,a,penny,when,he,was,twenty,and,even,stricken,his,name,from,the,family,bible,<END>
after,that,he,had,wandered,to,california,in,the,gold,rush,of,1849,and,thence,to,south,america,and,cuba,and,the,reports,of,his,activities,in,these,parts,were,none,too,savory,<END>
scrapes,about,women,several,shootings,gun,running,to,the,revolutionists,in,central,america,and,worst,of,all,professional,gambling,were,included,in,his,career,as,atlanta,heard,it,<END>
there,was,hardly,a,family,in,georgia,who,could,not,own,to,their,sorrow,at,least,one,male,member,or,relative,who,gambled,losing,money,houses,land,and,slaves,<END>
but,that,was,different,<END>
a,man,could,gamble,himself,to,poverty,and,still,be,a,gentleman,but,a,professional,gambler,could,never,be,anything,but,an,outcast,<END>
had,it,not,been,for,the,upset,conditions,due,to,the,war,and,his,own,services,to,the,confederate,government,rhett,butler,would,never,have,been,received,in,atlanta,<END>
but,now,even,the,most,strait,laced,felt,that,patriotism,called,upon,them,to,be,more,broad,minded,<END>
the,more,sentimental,were,inclined,to,view,that,the,black,sheep,of,the,butler,family,had,repented,of,his,evil,ways,and,was,making,an,attempt,to,atone,for,his,sins,<END>
so,the,ladies,felt,in,duty,bound,to,stretch,a,point,especially,in,the,case,of,so,intrepid,a,blockader,<END>
everyone,knew,now,that,the,fate,of,the,confederacy,rested,as,much,upon,the,skill,of,the,blockade,boats,in,eluding,the,yankee,fleet,as,it,did,upon,the,soldiers,at,the,front,<END>

reared,in,charleston,he,knew,every,inlet,creek,shoal,and,rock,of,the,carolina,coast,near,that,port,and,he,was,equally,at,home,in,the,waters,around,wilmington,<END>
he,had,never,lost,a,boat,or,even,been,forced,to,dump,a,cargo,<END>
at,the,onset,of,the,war,he,had,emerged,from,obscurity,with,enough,money,to,buy,a,small,swift,boat,and,now,when,blockaded,goods,realized,two,thousand,per,cent,on,each,cargo,he,owned,four,boats,<END>
he,had,good,pilots,and,paid,them,well,and,they,slid,out,of,charleston,and,wilmington,on,dark,nights,bearing,cotton,for,nassau,england,and,canada,<END>
the,cotton,mills,of,england,were,standing,idle,and,the,workers,were,starving,and,any,blockader,who,could,outwit,the,yankee,fleet,could,command,his,own,price,in,liverpool,<END>
rhett's,boats,were,singularly,lucky,both,in,taking,out,cotton,for,the,confederacy,and,bringing,in,the,war,materials,for,which,the,south,was,desperate,<END>
yes,the,ladies,felt,they,could,forgive,and,forget,a,great,many,things,for,such,a,brave,man,<END>
he,was,a,dashing,figure,and,one,that,people,turned,to,look,at,<END>
he,spent,money,freely,rode,a,wild,black,stallion,and,wore,clothes,which,were,always,the,height,of,style,and,tailoring,<END>
the,latter,in,itself,was,enough,to,attract,attention,to,him,for,the,uniforms,of,the,soldiers,were,dingy,and,worn,now,and,the,civilians,even,when,turned,out,in,their,best,showed,skillful,patching,and,darning,<END>
scarlett,thought,she,had,never,seen,such,elegant,pants,as,he,wore,fawn,colored,shepherd's,plaid,and,checked,<END>
as,for,his,waistcoats,they,were,indescribably,handsome,especially,the,white,watered-silk,one,with,tiny,pink,rosebuds,embroidered,on,it,<END>
and,he,wore,these,garments,with,a,still,more,elegant,air,as,though,unaware,of,their,glory,<END>
there,were,few,ladies,who,could,resist,his,charms,when,he,chose,to,exert,them,and,finally,even,mrs,merriwether,unbent,and,invited,him,to,sunday,dinner,<END>
maybelle,merriwether,was,to,marry,her,little,zouave,when,he,got,his,next,furlough,and,she,cried,every,time,she,thought,of,it,for,she,had,set,her,heart,on,marrying,in,a,white,satin,dress,and,there,was,no,white,satin,in,the,confederacy,<END>
nor,could,she,borrow,a,dress,for,the,satin,wedding,dresses,of,years,past,had,all,gone,into,the,making,of,battle,flags,<END>
useless,for,the,patriotic,mrs,merriwether,to,upbraid,her,daughter,and,point,out,that,homespun,was,the,proper,bridal,attire,for,a,confederate,bride,<END>
maybelle,wanted,satin,<END>
she,was,willing,even,proud,to,go,without,hairpins,and,buttons,and,nice,shoes,and,candy,and,tea,for,the,sake,of,the,cause,but,she,wanted,a,satin,wedding,dress,<END>
rhett,hearing,of,this,from,melanie,brought,in,from,england,yards,and,yards,of,gleaming,white,satin,and,a,lace,veil,and,presented,them,to,her,as,a,wedding,gift,<END>
he,did,it,in,such,a,way,that,it,was,unthinkable,to,even,mention,paying,him,for,them,and,maybelle,was,so,delighted,she,almost,kissed,him,<END>
mrs,merriwether,knew,that,so,expensive,a,gift,and,a,gift,of,clothing,at,that,was,highly,improper,but,she,could,think,of,no,way,of,refusing,when,rhett,told,her,in,the,most,florid,language,that,nothing,was,too,good,to,deck,the,bride,of,one,of,our,brave,heroes,<END>
so,mrs,merriwether,invited,him,to,dinner,feeling,that,this,concession,more,than,paid,for,the,gift,<END>
he,not,only,brought,maybelle,the,satin,but,he,was,able,to,give,excellent,hints,on,the,making,of,the,wedding,dress,<END>
hoops,in,paris,were,wider,this,season,and,skirts,were,shorter,<END>
they,were,no,longer,ruffled,but,were,gathered,up,in,scalloped,festoons,showing,braided,petticoats,beneath,<END>
he,said,too,that,he,had,seen,no,pantalets,on,the,streets,so,he,imagined,they,were,out,<END>
afterwards,mrs,merriwether,told,mrs,elsing,she,feared,that,if,she,had,given,him,any,encouragement,at,all,he,would,have,told,her,exactly,what,kind,of,drawers,were,being,worn,by,parisiennes,<END>
had,he,been,less,obviously,masculine,his,ability,to,recall,details,of,dresses,bonnets,and,coiffures,would,have,been,put,down,as,the,rankest,effeminacy,<END>
the,ladies,always,felt,a,little,odd,when,they,besieged,him,with,questions,about,styles,but,they,did,it,nevertheless,<END>
they,were,as,isolated,from,the,world,of,fashion,as,shipwrecked,mariners,for,few,books,of,fashion,came,through,the,blockade,<END>
for,all,they,knew,the,ladies,of,france,might,be,shaving,their,heads,and,wearing,coonskin,caps,so,rhett's,memory,for,furbelows,was,an,excellent,substitute,for,godey's,lady's,book,<END>
he,could,and,did,notice,details,so,dear,to,feminine,hearts,and,after,each,trip,abroad,he,could,be,found,in,the,center,of,a,group,of,ladies,telling,that,bonnets,were,smaller,this,year,and,perched,higher,covering,most,of,the,top,of,the,head,that,plumes,and,not,flowers,were,being,used,to,trim,them,that,the,empress,of,france,had,abandoned,the,chignon,for,evening,wear,and,had,her,hair,piled,almost,on,the,top,of,her,head,showing,all,of,her,ears,and,that,evening,frocks,were,shockingly,low,again,<END>
for,some,months,he,was,the,most,popular,and,romantic,figure,the,town,knew,despite,his,previous,reputation,despite,the,faint,rumors,that,he,was,engaged,not,only,in,blockading,but,in,speculating,on,foodstuffs,too,<END>
people,who,did,not,like,him,said,that,after,every,trip,he,made,to,atlanta,prices,jumped,five,dollars,<END>
but,even,with,this,under-cover,gossip,seeping,about,he,could,have,retained,his,popularity,had,he,considered,it,worth,retaining,<END>
instead,it,seemed,as,though,after,trying,the,company,of,the,staid,and,patriotic,citizens,and,winning,their,respect,and,grudging,liking,something,perverse,in,him,made,him,go,out,of,his,way,to,affront,them,and,show,them,that,his,conduct,had,been,only,a,masquerade,and,one,which,no,longer,amused,him,<END>
it,was,as,though,he,bore,an,impersonal,contempt,for,everyone,and,everything,in,the,south,the,confederacy,in,particular,and,took,no,pains,to,conceal,it,<END>
it,was,his,remarks,about,the,confederacy,that,made,atlanta,look,at,him,first,in,bewilderment,then,coolly,and,then,with,hot,rage,<END>
even,before,1862,passed,into,1863,men,were,bowing,to,him,with,studied,frigidity,and,women,beginning,to,draw,their,daughters,to,their,sides,when,he,appeared,at,a,gathering,<END>
he,seemed,to,take,pleasure,not,only,in,affronting,the,sincere,and,red-hot,loyalties,of,atlanta,but,in,presenting,himself,in,the,worst,possible,light,<END>
when,well-meaning,people,complimented,him,on,his,bravery,in,running,the,blockade,he,blandly,replied,that,he,was,always,frightened,when,in,danger,as,frightened,as,were,the,brave,boys,at,the,front,<END>
everyone,knew,there,had,never,been,a,cowardly,confederate,soldier,and,they,found,this,statement,peculiarly,irritating,<END>
he,always,referred,to,the,soldiers,as,our,brave,boys,and,our,heroes,in,gray,and,did,it,in,such,a,way,as,to,convey,the,utmost,in,insult,<END>
when,daring,young,ladies,hoping,for,a,flirtation,thanked,him,for,being,one,of,the,heroes,who,fought,for,them,he,bowed,and,declared,that,such,was,not,the,case,for,he,would,do,the,same,thing,for,yankee,women,if,the,same,amount,of,money,were,involved,<END>
since,scarlett's,first,meeting,with,him,in,atlanta,on,the,night,of,the,bazaar,he,had,talked,with,her,in,this,manner,but,now,there,was,a,thinly,veiled,note,of,mockery,in,his,conversations,with,everyone,<END>
when,praised,for,his,services,to,the,confederacy,he,unfailingly,replied,that,blockading,was,a,business,with,him,<END>
if,he,could,make,as,much,money,out,of,government,contracts,he,would,say,picking,out,with,his,eyes,those,who,had,government,contracts,then,he,would,certainly,abandon,the,hazards,of,blockading,and,take,to,selling,shoddy,cloth,sanded,sugar,spoiled,flour,and,rotten,leather,to,the,confederacy,<END>
most,of,his,remarks,were,unanswerable,which,made,them,all,the,worse,<END>
there,had,already,been,minor,scandals,about,those,holding,government,contracts,<END>
letters,from,men,at,the,front,complained,constantly,of,shoes,that,wore,out,in,a,week,gunpowder,that,would,not,ignite,harness,that,snapped,at,any,strain,meat,that,was,rotten,and,flour,that,was,full,of,weevils,<END>
atlanta,people,tried,to,think,that,the,men,who,sold,such,stuff,to,the,government,must,be,contract,holders,from,alabama,or,virginia,or,tennessee,and,not,georgians,<END>
for,did,not,the,georgia,contract,holders,include,men,from,the,very,best,families,<END>
were,they,not,the,first,to,contribute,to,the,hospital,funds,and,to,the,aid,of,soldiers',orphans,<END>
were,they,not,the,first,to,cheer,at,dixie,and,the,most,rampant,seekers,in,oratory,at,least,for,yankee,blood,<END>
the,full,tide,of,fury,against,those,profiteering,on,government,contracts,had,not,yet,risen,and,rhett's,words,were,taken,merely,as,evidence,of,his,own,bad,breeding,<END>
he,not,only,affronted,the,town,with,insinuations,of,venality,on,the,part,of,men,in,high,places,and,slurs,on,the,courage,of,the,men,in,the,field,but,he,took,pleasure,in,tricking,the,dignified,citizenry,into,embarrassing,situations,<END>
he,could,no,more,resist,pricking,the,conceits,the,hypocrisies,and,the,flamboyant,patriotism,of,those,about,him,than,a,small,boy,can,resist,putting,a,pin,into,a,balloon,<END>
he,neatly,deflated,the,pompous,and,exposed,the,ignorant,and,the,bigoted,and,he,did,it,in,such,subtle,ways,drawing,his,victims,out,by,his,seemingly,courteous,interest,that,they,never,were,quite,certain,what,had,happened,until,they,stood,exposed,as,windy,high,flown,and,slightly,ridiculous,<END>
during,the,months,when,the,town,accepted,him,scarlett,had,been,under,no,illusions,about,him,<END>
she,knew,that,his,elaborate,gallantries,and,his,florid,speeches,were,all,done,with,his,tongue,in,his,cheek,<END>
she,knew,that,he,was,acting,the,part,of,the,dashing,and,patriotic,blockade,runner,simply,because,it,amused,him,<END>
sometimes,he,seemed,to,her,like,the,county,boys,with,whom,she,had,grown,up,the,wild,tarleton,twins,with,their,obsession,for,practical,jokes,the,devil-inspired,fontaines,teasing,mischievous,the,calverts,who,would,sit,up,all,night,planning,hoaxes,<END>
but,there,was,a,difference,for,beneath,rhett's,seeming,lightness,there,was,something,malicious,almost,sinister,in,its,suave,brutality,<END>
though,she,was,thoroughly,aware,of,his,insincerity,she,much,preferred,him,in,the,role,of,the,romantic,blockader,<END>
for,one,thing,it,made,her,own,situation,in,associating,with,him,so,much,easier,than,it,had,been,at,first,<END>
so,she,was,intensely,annoyed,when,he,dropped,his,masquerade,and,set,out,apparently,upon,a,deliberate,campaign,to,alienate,atlanta's,good,will,<END>
it,annoyed,her,because,it,seemed,foolish,and,also,because,some,of,the,harsh,criticism,directed,at,him,fell,on,her,<END>
it,was,at,mrs,elsing's,silver,musicale,for,the,benefit,of,the,convalescents,that,rhett,signed,his,final,warrant,of,ostracism,<END>
that,afternoon,the,elsing,home,was,crowded,with,soldiers,on,leave,and,men,from,the,hospitals,members,of,the,home,guard,and,the,militia,unit,and,matrons,widows,and,young,girls,<END>
every,chair,in,the,house,was,occupied,and,even,the,long,winding,stair,was,packed,with,guests,<END>
the,large,cut-glass,bowl,held,at,the,door,by,the,elsings',butler,had,been,emptied,twice,of,its,burden,of,silver,coins,<END>
that,in,itself,was,enough,to,make,the,affair,a,success,for,now,a,dollar,in,silver,was,worth,sixty,dollars,in,confederate,paper,money,<END>
every,girl,with,any,pretense,to,accomplishments,had,sung,or,played,the,piano,and,the,tableaux,vivants,had,been,greeted,with,flattering,applause,<END>

with,a,feeling,of,exasperation,she,saw,that,he,was,in,an,argument,and,probably,had,not,even,noticed,her,<END>
scarlett,could,see,by,the,faces,of,the,group,surrounding,him,that,they,were,infuriated,by,what,he,was,saying,<END>
she,made,her,way,toward,them,and,in,one,of,those,odd,silences,which,sometimes,fall,on,a,gathering,she,heard,willie,guinan,of,the,militia,outfit,say,plainly,do,i,understand,sir,that,you,mean,the,cause,for,which,our,heroes,have,died,is,not,sacred,<END>
if,you,were,run,over,by,a,railroad,train,your,death,wouldn't,sanctify,the,railroad,company,would,it,<END>

of,course,he,was,the,only,boy,his,mother,had,and,after,all,somebody,had,to,be,in,the,militia,to,protect,the,state,<END>

he,meant,exactly,what,captain,butler,meant,only,he,didn't,say,it,in,a,rude,way,<END>
you,should,be,ashamed,of,yourself,comparing,a,fine,man,like,ashley,wilkes,to,a,scoundrel,like,captain,butler,<END>

and,i'm,not,ashamed,that,he,thinks,that,way,<END>
he,thinks,the,war,is,all,wrong,but,he's,willing,to,fight,and,die,anyway,and,that,takes,lots,more,courage,than,fighting,for,something,you,think,is,right,<END>

now,melanie,had,given,a,new,meaning,to,passages,in,the,letters,which,scarlett's,eyes,had,barely,seen,<END>
it,shocked,her,to,realize,that,anyone,as,absolutely,perfect,as,ashley,could,have,any,thought,in,common,with,such,a,reprobate,as,rhett,butler,<END>

chapter,xiii,<END>
under,mrs,merriwether's,goading,dr,meade,took,action,in,the,form,of,a,letter,to,the,newspaper,wherein,he,did,not,mention,rhett,by,name,though,his,meaning,was,obvious,<END>
the,editor,sensing,the,social,drama,of,the,letter,put,it,on,the,second,page,of,the,paper,in,itself,a,startling,innovation,as,the,first,two,pages,of,the,paper,were,always,devoted,to,advertisements,of,slaves,mules,plows,coffins,houses,for,sale,or,rent,cures,for,private,diseases,abortifacients,and,restoratives,for,lost,manhood,<END>
the,doctor's,letter,was,the,first,of,a,chorus,of,indignation,that,was,beginning,to,be,heard,all,over,the,south,against,speculators,profiteers,and,holders,of,government,contracts,<END>

with,the,rise,in,prices,confederate,money,sank,and,with,its,rapid,fall,there,rose,a,wild,passion,for,luxuries,<END>
blockaders,were,commissioned,to,bring,in,necessities,but,now,it,was,the,higher-priced,luxuries,that,filled,their,boats,to,the,exclusion,of,the,things,the,confederacy,vitally,needed,<END>
people,frenziedly,bought,these,luxuries,with,the,money,they,had,today,fearing,that,tomorrow's,prices,would,be,higher,and,the,money,worthless,<END>
to,make,matters,worse,there,was,only,one,railroad,line,from,wilmington,to,richmond,and,while,thousands,of,barrels,of,flour,and,boxes,of,bacon,spoiled,and,rotted,in,wayside,stations,for,want,of,transportation,speculators,with,wines,taffetas,and,coffee,to,sell,seemed,always,able,to,get,their,goods,to,richmond,two,days,after,they,were,landed,at,wilmington,<END>
the,rumor,which,had,been,creeping,about,underground,was,now,being,openly,discussed,that,rhett,butler,not,only,ran,his,own,four,boats,and,sold,the,cargoes,at,unheard-of,prices,but,bought,up,the,cargoes,of,other,boats,and,held,them,for,rises,in,prices,<END>
it,was,said,that,he,was,at,the,head,of,a,combine,worth,more,than,a,million,dollars,with,wilmington,as,its,headquarters,for,the,purpose,of,buying,blockade,goods,on,the,docks,<END>
they,had,dozens,of,warehouses,in,that,city,and,in,richmond,so,the,story,ran,and,the,warehouses,were,crammed,with,food,and,clothing,that,were,being,held,for,higher,prices,<END>
already,soldiers,and,civilians,alike,were,feeling,the,pinch,and,the,muttering,against,him,and,his,fellow,speculators,was,bitter,<END>
there,are,many,brave,and,patriotic,men,in,the,blockade,arm,of,the,confederacy's,naval,service,ran,the,last,of,the,doctor's,letter,unselfish,men,who,are,risking,their,lives,and,all,their,wealth,that,the,confederacy,may,survive,<END>

and,she,knew,that,this,was,utterly,wrong,knew,she,should,be,shocked,and,infuriated,<END>
actually,she,was,neither,but,she,could,pretend,to,be,<END>
it,made,her,feel,more,respectable,and,ladylike,<END>
i,think,what,dr,meade,wrote,about,was,right,captain,butler,<END>
the,only,way,to,redeem,yourself,is,to,enlist,after,you,sell,your,boats,<END>
you're,a,west,pointer,and,<END>
you,talk,like,a,baptist,preacher,making,a,recruiting,speech,<END>
suppose,i,don't,want,to,redeem,myself,<END>
why,should,i,fight,to,uphold,the,system,that,cast,me,out,<END>
i,shall,take,pleasure,in,seeing,it,smashed,<END>
i,never,heard,of,any,system,she,said,crossly,<END>
no,<END>
and,yet,you,are,a,part,of,it,like,i,was,and,i'll,wager,you,don't,like,it,any,more,than,i,did,<END>
well,why,am,i,the,black,sheep,of,the,butler,family,<END>
for,this,reason,and,no,other,i,didn't,conform,to,charleston,and,i,couldn't,<END>
and,charleston,is,the,south,only,intensified,<END>
i,wonder,if,you,realize,yet,what,a,bore,it,is,<END>
so,many,things,that,one,must,do,because,they've,always,been,done,<END>
so,many,things,quite,harmless,that,one,must,not,do,for,the,same,reason,<END>
so,many,things,that,annoyed,me,by,their,senselessness,<END>
not,marrying,the,young,lady,of,whom,you,have,probably,heard,was,merely,the,last,straw,<END>
why,should,i,marry,a,boring,fool,simply,because,an,accident,prevented,me,from,getting,her,home,before,dark,<END>
and,why,permit,her,wild-eyed,brother,to,shoot,and,kill,me,when,i,could,shoot,straighter,<END>
if,i,had,been,a,gentleman,of,course,i,would,have,let,him,kill,me,and,that,would,have,wiped,the,blot,from,the,butler,escutcheon,<END>
but,i,like,to,live,<END>
and,so,i've,lived,and,i've,had,a,good,time,<END>
when,i,think,of,my,brother,living,among,the,sacred,cows,of,charleston,and,most,reverent,toward,them,and,remember,his,stodgy,wife,and,his,saint,cecilia,balls,and,his,everlasting,rice,fields,then,i,know,the,compensation,for,breaking,with,the,system,<END>
scarlett,our,southern,way,of,living,is,as,antiquated,as,the,feudal,system,of,the,middle,ages,<END>
the,wonder,is,that,it's,lasted,as,long,as,it,has,<END>
it,had,to,go,and,it's,going,now,<END>
and,yet,you,expect,me,to,listen,to,orators,like,dr,meade,who,tell,me,our,cause,is,just,and,holy,<END>
and,get,so,excited,by,the,roll,of,drums,that,i'll,grab,a,musket,and,rush,off,to,virginia,to,shed,my,blood,for,marse,robert,<END>
what,kind,of,a,fool,do,you,think,i,am,<END>
kissing,the,rod,that,chastised,me,is,not,in,my,line,<END>
the,south,and,i,are,even,now,<END>
the,south,threw,me,out,to,starve,once,<END>
i,haven't,starved,and,i,am,making,enough,money,out,of,the,south's,death,throes,to,compensate,me,for,my,lost,birthright,<END>
i,think,you,are,vile,and,mercenary,said,scarlett,but,her,remark,was,automatic,<END>
most,of,what,he,was,saying,went,over,her,head,as,did,any,conversation,that,was,not,personal,<END>
but,part,of,it,made,sense,<END>
there,were,such,a,lot,of,foolish,things,about,life,among,nice,people,<END>
having,to,pretend,that,her,heart,was,in,the,grave,when,it,wasn't,<END>
and,how,shocked,everybody,had,been,when,she,danced,at,the,bazaar,<END>
and,the,infuriating,way,people,lifted,their,eyebrows,every,time,she,did,or,said,anything,the,least,bit,different,from,what,every,other,young,woman,did,and,said,<END>
but,still,she,was,jarred,at,hearing,him,attack,the,very,traditions,that,irked,her,most,<END>
she,had,lived,too,long,among,people,who,dissembled,politely,not,to,feel,disturbed,at,hearing,her,own,thoughts,put,into,words,<END>
mercenary,<END>
no,i'm,only,farsighted,<END>
though,perhaps,that,is,merely,a,synonym,for,mercenary,<END>
at,least,people,who,were,not,as,farsighted,as,i,will,call,it,that,<END>
any,loyal,confederate,who,had,a,thousand,dollars,in,cash,in,1861,could,have,done,what,i,did,but,how,few,were,mercenary,enough,to,take,advantage,of,their,opportunities,<END>
as,for,instance,right,after,fort,sumter,fell,and,before,the,blockade,was,established,i,bought,up,several,thousand,bales,of,cotton,at,dirt-cheap,prices,and,ran,them,to,england,<END>
they,are,still,there,in,warehouses,in,liverpool,<END>
i've,never,sold,them,<END>
i'm,holding,them,until,the,english,mills,have,to,have,cotton,and,will,give,me,any,price,i,ask,<END>
i,wouldn't,be,surprised,if,i,got,a,dollar,a,pound,<END>
you'll,get,a,dollar,a,pound,when,elephants,roost,in,trees,<END>
i'll,believe,i'll,get,it,<END>
cotton,is,at,seventy-two,cents,a,pound,already,<END>
i'm,going,to,be,a,rich,man,when,this,war,is,over,scarlett,because,i,was,farsighted,pardon,me,mercenary,<END>
i,told,you,once,before,that,there,were,two,times,for,making,big,money,one,in,the,upbuilding,of,a,country,and,the,other,in,its,destruction,<END>
slow,money,on,the,upbuilding,fast,money,in,the,crack-up,<END>
remember,my,words,<END>
perhaps,they,may,be,of,use,to,you,some,day,<END>
i,do,appreciate,good,advice,so,much,said,scarlett,with,all,the,sarcasm,she,could,muster,<END>
but,i,don't,need,your,advice,<END>
do,you,think,pa,is,a,pauper,<END>
he's,got,all,the,money,i'll,ever,need,and,then,i,have,charles',property,besides,<END>
i,imagine,the,french,aristocrats,thought,practically,the,same,thing,until,the,very,moment,when,they,climbed,into,the,tumbrils,<END>
frequently,rhett,pointed,out,to,scarlett,the,inconsistency,of,her,wearing,black,mourning,clothes,when,she,was,participating,in,all,social,activities,<END>
he,liked,bright,colors,and,scarlett's,funeral,dresses,and,the,crepe,veil,that,hung,from,her,bonnet,to,her,heels,both,amused,him,and,offended,him,<END>
but,she,clung,to,her,dull,black,dresses,and,her,veil,knowing,that,if,she,changed,them,for,colors,without,waiting,several,more,years,the,town,would,buzz,even,more,than,it,was,already,buzzing,<END>
and,besides,how,would,she,ever,explain,to,her,mother,<END>
rhett,said,frankly,that,the,crepe,veil,made,her,look,like,a,crow,and,the,black,dresses,added,ten,years,to,her,age,<END>
this,ungallant,statement,sent,her,flying,to,the,mirror,to,see,if,she,really,did,look,twenty-eight,instead,of,eighteen,<END>
i,should,think,you'd,have,more,pride,than,to,try,to,look,like,mrs,merriwether,he,taunted,<END>
and,better,taste,than,to,wear,that,veil,to,advertise,a,grief,i'm,sure,you,never,felt,<END>
i'll,lay,a,wager,with,you,<END>
i'll,have,that,bonnet,and,veil,off,your,head,and,a,paris,creation,on,it,within,two,months,<END>
indeed,no,and,don't,let's,discuss,it,any,further,said,scarlett,annoyed,by,his,reference,to,charles,<END>
rhett,who,was,preparing,to,leave,for,wilmington,for,another,trip,abroad,departed,with,a,grin,on,his,face,<END>
one,bright,summer,morning,some,weeks,later,he,reappeared,with,a,brightly,trimmed,hatbox,in,his,hand,and,after,finding,that,scarlett,was,alone,in,the,house,he,opened,it,<END>
wrapped,in,layers,of,tissue,was,a,bonnet,a,creation,that,made,her,cry,oh,the,darling,thing,<END>
as,she,reached,for,it,<END>
starved,for,the,sight,much,less,the,touch,of,new,clothes,it,seemed,the,loveliest,bonnet,she,had,ever,seen,<END>
it,was,of,dark-green,taffeta,lined,with,water,silk,of,a,pale-jade,color,<END>
the,ribbons,that,tied,under,the,chin,were,as,wide,as,her,hand,and,they,too,were,pale,green,<END>
and,curled,about,the,brim,of,this,confection,was,the,perkiest,of,green,ostrich,plumes,<END>
put,it,on,said,rhett,smiling,<END>
she,flew,across,the,room,to,the,mirror,and,plopped,it,on,her,head,pushing,back,her,hair,to,show,her,earrings,and,tying,the,ribbon,under,her,chin,<END>
how,do,i,look,<END>
she,cried,pirouetting,for,his,benefit,and,tossing,her,head,so,that,the,plume,danced,<END>
but,she,knew,she,looked,pretty,even,before,she,saw,confirmation,in,his,eyes,<END>
she,looked,attractively,saucy,and,the,green,of,the,lining,made,her,eyes,dark,emerald,and,sparkling,<END>
oh,rhett,whose,bonnet,is,it,<END>
i'll,buy,it,<END>
i'll,give,you,every,cent,i've,got,for,it,<END>
it's,your,bonnet,he,said,<END>
who,else,could,wear,that,shade,of,green,<END>
don't,you,think,i,carried,the,color,of,your,eyes,well,in,my,mind,<END>
did,you,really,have,it,trimmed,just,for,me,<END>
yes,and,there's,'rue,de,la,paix',on,the,box,if,that,means,anything,to,you,<END>
it,meant,nothing,to,her,smiling,at,her,reflection,in,the,mirror,<END>
just,at,this,moment,nothing,mattered,to,her,except,that,she,looked,utterly,charming,in,the,first,pretty,hat,she,had,put,on,her,head,in,two,years,<END>
what,she,couldn't,do,with,this,hat,<END>
and,then,her,smile,faded,<END>
don't,you,like,it,<END>
oh,it's,a,dream,but,oh,i,do,hate,to,have,to,cover,this,lovely,green,with,crepe,and,dye,the,feather,black,<END>
he,was,beside,her,quickly,and,his,deft,fingers,untied,the,wide,bow,under,her,chin,<END>
in,a,moment,the,hat,was,back,in,its,box,<END>
what,are,you,doing,<END>
you,said,it,was,mine,<END>
but,not,to,change,to,a,mourning,bonnet,<END>
i,shall,find,some,other,charming,lady,with,green,eyes,who,appreciates,my,taste,<END>
oh,you,shan't,<END>
i'll,die,if,i,don't,have,it,<END>
oh,please,rhett,don't,be,mean,<END>
let,me,have,it,<END>
and,turn,it,into,a,fright,like,your,other,hats,<END>
no,<END>
she,clutched,at,the,box,<END>
that,sweet,thing,that,made,her,look,so,young,and,enchanting,to,be,given,to,some,other,girl,<END>
oh,never,<END>
for,a,moment,she,thought,of,the,horror,of,pitty,and,melanie,<END>
she,thought,of,ellen,and,what,she,would,say,and,she,shivered,<END>
but,vanity,was,stronger,<END>
i,won't,change,it,<END>
i,promise,<END>
now,do,let,me,have,it,<END>
he,gave,her,the,box,with,a,slightly,sardonic,smile,and,watched,her,while,she,put,it,on,again,and,preened,herself,<END>
how,much,is,it,<END>
she,asked,suddenly,her,face,falling,<END>
i,have,only,fifty,dollars,but,next,month,<END>
it,would,cost,about,two,thousand,dollars,confederate,money,he,said,with,a,grin,at,her,woebegone,expression,<END>
oh,dear,well,suppose,i,give,you,the,fifty,now,and,then,when,i,get,<END>
i,don't,want,any,money,for,it,he,said,<END>
it's,a,gift,<END>
scarlett's,mouth,dropped,open,<END>
the,line,was,so,closely,so,carefully,drawn,where,gifts,from,men,were,concerned,<END>
candy,and,flowers,dear,ellen,had,said,time,and,again,and,perhaps,a,book,of,poetry,or,an,album,or,a,small,bottle,of,florida,water,are,the,only,things,a,lady,may,accept,from,a,gentleman,<END>
never,never,any,expensive,gift,even,from,your,fiance,<END>
and,never,any,gift,of,jewelry,or,wearing,apparel,not,even,gloves,or,handkerchiefs,<END>
should,you,accept,such,gifts,men,would,know,you,were,no,lady,and,would,try,to,take,liberties,<END>
oh,dear,thought,scarlett,looking,first,at,herself,in,the,mirror,and,then,at,rhett's,unreadable,face,<END>
i,simply,can't,tell,him,i,won't,accept,it,<END>
it's,too,darling,<END>
i'd,i'd,almost,rather,he,took,a,liberty,if,it,was,a,very,small,one,<END>
then,she,was,horrified,at,herself,for,having,such,a,thought,and,she,turned,pink,<END>
i'll,i'll,give,you,the,fifty,dollars,<END>
if,you,do,i,will,throw,it,in,the,gutter,<END>
or,better,still,buy,masses,for,your,soul,<END>
i'm,sure,your,soul,could,do,with,a,few,masses,<END>
she,laughed,unwillingly,and,the,laughing,reflection,under,the,green,brim,decided,her,instantly,<END>
whatever,are,you,trying,to,do,to,me,<END>
i'm,tempting,you,with,fine,gifts,until,your,girlish,ideals,are,quite,worn,away,and,you,are,at,my,mercy,he,said,<END>
'accept,only,candy,and,flowers,from,gentlemen,dearie,',he,mimicked,and,she,burst,into,a,giggle,<END>
you,are,a,clever,black-hearted,wretch,rhett,butler,and,you,know,very,well,this,bonnet's,too,pretty,to,be,refused,<END>
his,eyes,mocked,her,even,while,they,complimented,her,beauty,<END>
of,course,you,can,tell,miss,pitty,that,you,gave,me,a,sample,of,taffeta,and,green,silk,and,drew,a,picture,of,the,bonnet,and,i,extorted,fifty,dollars,from,you,for,it,<END>
no,<END>
i,shall,say,one,hundred,dollars,and,she'll,tell,everybody,in,town,and,everybody,will,be,green,with,envy,and,talk,about,my,extravagance,<END>
but,rhett,you,mustn't,bring,me,anything,else,so,expensive,<END>
it's,awfully,kind,of,you,but,i,really,couldn't,accept,anything,else,<END>
indeed,<END>
well,i,shall,bring,you,presents,so,long,as,it,pleases,me,and,so,long,as,i,see,things,that,will,enhance,your,charms,<END>
i,shall,bring,you,dark-green,watered,silk,for,a,frock,to,match,the,bonnet,<END>
and,i,warn,you,that,i,am,not,kind,<END>
i,am,tempting,you,with,bonnets,and,bangles,and,leading,you,into,a,pit,<END>
always,remember,i,never,do,anything,without,reason,and,i,never,give,anything,without,expecting,something,in,return,<END>
i,always,get,paid,<END>
his,black,eyes,sought,her,face,and,traveled,to,her,lips,<END>
scarlett,cast,down,her,eyes,excitement,filling,her,<END>
now,he,was,going,to,try,to,take,liberties,just,as,ellen,predicted,<END>
he,was,going,to,kiss,her,or,try,to,kiss,her,and,she,couldn't,quite,make,up,her,flurried,mind,which,it,should,be,<END>
if,she,refused,he,might,jerk,the,bonnet,right,off,her,head,and,give,it,to,some,other,girl,<END>
on,the,other,hand,if,she,permitted,one,chaste,peck,he,might,bring,her,other,lovely,presents,in,the,hope,of,getting,another,kiss,<END>
men,set,such,a,store,by,kisses,though,heaven,alone,knew,why,<END>
and,lots,of,times,after,one,kiss,they,fell,completely,in,love,with,a,girl,and,made,most,entertaining,spectacles,of,themselves,provided,the,girl,was,clever,and,withheld,her,kisses,after,the,first,one,<END>
it,would,be,exciting,to,have,rhett,butler,in,love,with,her,and,admitting,it,and,begging,for,a,kiss,or,a,smile,<END>
yes,she,would,let,him,kiss,her,<END>
but,he,made,no,move,to,kiss,her,<END>
she,gave,him,a,sidelong,glance,from,under,her,lashes,and,murmured,encouragingly,<END>
so,you,always,get,paid,do,you,<END>
and,what,do,you,expect,to,get,from,me,<END>
that,remains,to,be,seen,<END>
well,if,you,think,i'll,marry,you,to,pay,for,the,bonnet,i,won't,she,said,daringly,and,gave,her,head,a,saucy,flirt,that,set,the,plume,to,bobbing,<END>
his,white,teeth,gleamed,under,his,little,mustache,<END>
madam,you,flatter,yourself,i,do,not,want,to,marry,you,or,anyone,else,<END>
i,am,not,a,marrying,man,<END>
indeed,<END>
she,cried,taken,aback,and,now,determined,that,he,should,take,some,liberty,<END>
i,don't,even,intend,to,kiss,you,either,<END>
then,why,is,your,mouth,all,pursed,up,in,that,ridiculous,way,<END>
oh,<END>
she,cried,as,she,caught,a,glimpse,of,herself,and,saw,that,her,red,lips,were,indeed,in,the,proper,pose,for,a,kiss,<END>
oh,<END>
she,cried,again,losing,her,temper,and,stamping,her,foot,<END>
you,are,the,horridest,man,i,have,ever,seen,and,i,don't,care,if,i,never,lay,eyes,on,you,again,<END>
if,you,really,felt,that,way,you'd,stamp,on,the,bonnet,<END>
my,what,a,passion,you,are,in,and,it's,quite,becoming,as,you,probably,know,<END>
come,scarlett,stamp,on,the,bonnet,to,show,me,what,you,think,of,me,and,my,presents,<END>
don't,you,dare,touch,this,bonnet,she,said,clutching,it,by,the,bow,and,retreating,<END>
he,came,after,her,laughing,softly,and,took,her,hands,in,his,<END>
oh,scarlett,you,are,so,young,you,wring,my,heart,he,said,<END>
and,i,shall,kiss,you,as,you,seem,to,expect,it,and,leaning,down,carelessly,his,mustache,just,grazed,her,cheek,<END>
now,do,you,feel,that,you,must,slap,me,to,preserve,the,proprieties,<END>
her,lips,mutinous,she,looked,up,into,his,eyes,and,saw,so,much,amusement,in,their,dark,depths,that,she,burst,into,laughter,<END>
what,a,tease,he,was,and,how,exasperating,<END>
if,he,didn't,want,to,marry,her,and,didn't,even,want,to,kiss,her,what,did,he,want,<END>
if,he,wasn't,in,love,with,her,why,did,he,call,so,often,and,bring,her,presents,<END>
that's,better,he,said,<END>
scarlett,i'm,a,bad,influence,on,you,and,if,you,have,any,sense,you,will,send,me,packing,if,you,can,<END>
i'm,very,hard,to,get,rid,of,<END>
but,i'm,bad,for,you,<END>
are,you,<END>
can't,you,see,it,<END>
ever,since,i,met,you,at,the,bazaar,your,career,has,been,most,shocking,and,i'm,to,blame,for,most,of,it,<END>
who,encouraged,you,to,dance,<END>
who,forced,you,to,admit,that,you,thought,our,glorious,cause,was,neither,glorious,nor,sacred,<END>
who,goaded,you,into,admitting,that,you,thought,men,were,fools,to,die,for,high-sounding,principles,<END>
who,has,aided,you,in,giving,the,old,ladies,plenty,to,gossip,about,<END>
who,is,getting,you,out,of,mourning,several,years,too,soon,<END>
and,who,to,end,all,this,has,lured,you,into,accepting,a,gift,which,no,lady,can,accept,and,still,remain,a,lady,<END>
you,flatter,yourself,captain,butler,<END>
i,haven't,done,anything,so,scandalous,and,i'd,have,done,everything,you,mentioned,without,your,aid,anyway,<END>
i,doubt,that,he,said,and,his,face,went,suddenly,quiet,and,somber,<END>
you'd,still,be,the,broken-hearted,widow,of,charles,hamilton,and,famed,for,your,good,deeds,among,the,wounded,<END>
eventually,however,<END>
but,she,was,not,listening,for,she,was,regarding,herself,pleasedly,in,the,mirror,again,thinking,she,would,wear,the,bonnet,to,the,hospital,this,very,afternoon,and,take,flowers,to,the,convalescent,officers,<END>
that,there,was,truth,in,his,last,words,did,not,occur,to,her,<END>
she,did,not,see,that,rhett,had,pried,open,the,prison,of,her,widowhood,and,set,her,free,to,queen,it,over,unmarried,girls,when,her,days,as,a,belle,should,have,been,long,past,<END>
nor,did,she,see,that,under,his,influence,she,had,come,a,long,way,from,ellen's,teachings,<END>
the,change,had,been,so,gradual,the,flouting,of,one,small,convention,seeming,to,have,no,connection,with,the,flouting,of,another,and,none,of,them,any,connection,with,rhett,<END>
she,did,not,realize,that,with,his,encouragement,she,had,disregarded,many,of,the,sternest,injunctions,of,her,mother,concerning,the,proprieties,forgotten,the,difficult,lessons,in,being,a,lady,<END>
she,only,saw,that,the,bonnet,was,the,most,becoming,one,she,ever,had,that,it,had,not,cost,her,a,penny,and,that,rhett,must,be,in,love,with,her,whether,he,admitted,it,or,not,<END>
and,she,certainly,intended,to,find,a,way,to,make,him,admit,it,<END>
the,next,day,scarlett,was,standing,in,front,of,the,mirror,with,a,comb,in,her,hand,and,her,mouth,full,of,hairpins,attempting,a,new,coiffure,which,maybelle,fresh,from,a,visit,to,her,husband,in,richmond,had,said,was,the,rage,at,the,capital,<END>
it,was,called,cats,rats,and,mice,and,presented,many,difficulties,<END>
the,hair,was,parted,in,the,middle,and,arranged,in,three,rolls,of,graduating,size,on,each,side,of,the,head,the,largest,nearest,the,part,being,the,cat,<END>

however,she,was,determined,to,accomplish,it,for,rhett,was,coming,to,supper,and,he,always,noticed,and,commented,upon,any,innovation,of,dress,or,hair,<END>
as,she,struggled,with,her,bushy,obstinate,locks,perspiration,beading,her,forehead,she,heard,light,running,feet,in,the,downstairs,hall,and,knew,that,melanie,was,home,from,the,hospital,<END>
as,she,heard,her,fly,up,the,stairs,two,at,a,time,she,paused,hairpin,in,mid-air,realizing,that,something,must,be,wrong,for,melanie,always,moved,as,decorously,as,a,dowager,<END>
she,went,to,the,door,and,threw,it,open,and,melanie,ran,in,her,face,flushed,and,frightened,looking,like,a,guilty,child,<END>

that,woman,with,red,hair,named,belle,watling,<END>
why,melly,<END>
cried,scarlett,so,shocked,she,could,only,stare,<END>
belle,watling,was,the,red-haired,woman,she,had,seen,on,the,street,the,first,day,she,came,to,atlanta,and,by,now,she,was,easily,the,most,notorious,woman,in,town,<END>
many,prostitutes,had,flocked,into,atlanta,following,the,soldiers,but,belle,stood,out,above,the,rest,due,to,her,flaming,hair,and,the,gaudy,overly,fashionable,dresses,she,wore,<END>
she,was,seldom,seen,on,peachtree,street,or,in,any,nice,neighborhood,but,when,she,did,appear,respectable,women,made,haste,to,cross,the,street,to,remove,themselves,from,her,vicinity,<END>

and,it,wasn't,my,fault,<END>
i,i,couldn't,run,away,from,her,<END>
it,would,have,been,so,rude,<END>
scarlett,i,i,felt,sorry,for,her,<END>
do,you,think,i'm,bad,for,feeling,that,way,<END>
but,scarlett,was,not,concerned,with,the,ethics,of,the,matter,<END>
like,most,innocent,and,well-bred,young,women,she,had,a,devouring,curiosity,about,prostitutes,<END>
what,did,she,want,<END>
what,does,she,talk,like,<END>
oh,she,used,awful,grammar,but,i,could,see,she,was,trying,so,hard,to,be,elegant,poor,thing,<END>
i,came,out,of,the,hospital,and,uncle,peter,and,the,carriage,weren't,waiting,so,i,thought,i'd,walk,home,<END>
and,when,i,went,by,the,emersons',yard,there,she,was,hiding,behind,the,hedge,<END>
oh,thank,heaven,the,emersons,are,in,macon,<END>
and,she,said,'please,mrs,wilkes,do,speak,a,minute,with,me,',<END>
i,don't,know,how,she,knew,my,name,<END>
i,knew,i,ought,to,run,as,hard,as,i,could,but,well,scarlett,she,looked,so,sad,and,well,sort,of,pleading,<END>
and,she,had,on,a,black,dress,and,black,bonnet,and,no,paint,and,really,looked,decent,but,for,that,red,hair,<END>
and,before,i,could,answer,she,said,<END>
'i,know,i,shouldn't,speak,to,you,but,i,tried,to,talk,to,that,old,peahen,mrs,elsing,and,she,ran,me,away,from,the,hospital,',<END>
did,she,really,call,her,a,peahen,<END>
said,scarlett,pleasedly,and,laughed,<END>
oh,don't,laugh,<END>
it,isn't,funny,<END>
it,seems,that,miss,this,woman,wanted,to,do,something,for,the,hospital,can,you,imagine,it,<END>
she,offered,to,nurse,every,morning,and,of,course,mrs,elsing,must,have,nearly,died,at,the,idea,and,ordered,her,out,of,the,hospital,<END>
and,then,she,said,'i,want,to,do,something,too,<END>
ain't,i,a,confedrut,good,as,you,',<END>
and,scarlett,i,was,right,touched,at,her,wanting,to,help,<END>
you,know,she,can't,be,all,bad,if,she,wants,to,help,the,cause,<END>
do,you,think,i'm,bad,to,feel,that,way,<END>
for,heaven's,sake,melly,who,cares,if,you're,bad,<END>
what,else,did,she,say,<END>
she,said,she'd,been,watching,the,ladies,go,by,to,the,hospital,and,thought,i,had,a,a,kind,face,and,so,she,stopped,me,<END>
she,had,some,money,and,she,wanted,me,to,take,it,and,use,it,for,the,hospital,and,not,tell,a,soul,where,it,came,from,<END>
she,said,mrs,elsing,wouldn't,let,it,be,used,if,she,knew,what,kind,of,money,it,was,<END>
what,kind,of,money,<END>
that's,when,i,thought,i'd,swoon,<END>
and,i,was,so,upset,and,anxious,to,get,away,i,just,said,'oh,yes,indeed,how,sweet,of,you',or,something,idiotic,and,she,smiled,and,said,'that's,right,christian,of,you',and,shoved,this,dirty,handkerchief,into,my,hand,<END>
ugh,can,you,smell,the,perfume,<END>
melanie,held,out,a,man's,handkerchief,soiled,and,highly,perfumed,in,which,some,coins,were,knotted,<END>
she,was,saying,thank,you,and,something,about,bringing,me,some,money,every,week,and,just,then,uncle,peter,drove,up,and,saw,me,<END>
melly,collapsed,into,tears,and,laid,her,head,on,the,pillow,<END>
and,when,he,saw,who,was,with,me,he,scarlett,he,hollered,at,me,<END>
nobody,has,ever,hollered,at,me,before,in,my,whole,life,<END>
and,he,said,'you,git,in,dis,hyah,cah'ige,dis,minute,',<END>
of,course,i,did,and,all,the,way,home,he,blessed,me,out,and,wouldn't,let,me,explain,and,said,he,was,going,to,tell,aunt,pitty,<END>
scarlett,do,go,down,and,beg,him,not,to,tell,her,<END>
perhaps,he,will,listen,to,you,<END>
it,will,kill,auntie,if,she,knows,i,ever,even,looked,that,woman,in,the,face,<END>
will,you,<END>
yes,i,will,<END>
but,let's,see,how,much,money,is,in,here,<END>
it,feels,heavy,<END>
she,untied,the,knot,and,a,handful,of,gold,coins,rolled,out,on,the,bed,<END>
scarlett,there's,fifty,dollars,here,<END>
and,in,gold,<END>
cried,melanie,awed,as,she,counted,the,bright,pieces,<END>
tell,me,do,you,think,it's,all,right,to,use,this,kind,well,money,made,er,this,way,for,the,boys,<END>
don't,you,think,that,maybe,god,will,understand,that,she,wanted,to,help,and,won't,care,if,it,is,tainted,<END>
when,i,think,of,how,many,things,the,hospital,needs,<END>
but,scarlett,was,not,listening,<END>
she,was,looking,at,the,dirty,handkerchief,and,humiliation,and,fury,were,filling,her,<END>
there,was,a,monogram,in,the,corner,in,which,were,the,initials,r,k,<END>

she,had,planned,to,return,it,to,him,when,he,came,to,supper,tonight,<END>
so,rhett,consorted,with,that,vile,watling,creature,and,gave,her,money,<END>
that,was,where,the,contribution,to,the,hospital,came,from,<END>
blockade,gold,<END>
and,to,think,that,rhett,would,have,the,gall,to,look,a,decent,woman,in,the,face,after,being,with,that,creature,<END>
and,to,think,that,she,could,have,believed,he,was,in,love,with,her,<END>
this,proved,he,couldn't,be,<END>
bad,women,and,all,they,involved,were,mysterious,and,revolting,matters,to,her,<END>
she,knew,that,men,patronized,these,women,for,purposes,which,no,lady,should,mention,or,if,she,did,mention,them,in,whispers,and,by,indirection,and,euphemism,<END>
she,had,always,thought,that,only,common,vulgar,men,visited,such,women,<END>
before,this,moment,it,had,never,occurred,to,her,that,nice,men,that,is,men,she,met,at,nice,homes,and,with,whom,she,danced,could,possibly,do,such,things,<END>
it,opened,up,an,entirely,new,field,of,thought,and,one,that,was,horrifying,<END>
perhaps,all,men,did,this,<END>
it,was,bad,enough,that,they,forced,their,wives,to,go,through,such,indecent,performances,but,to,actually,seek,out,low,women,and,pay,them,for,such,accommodation,<END>
oh,men,were,so,vile,and,rhett,butler,was,the,worst,of,them,all,<END>
she,would,take,this,handkerchief,and,fling,it,in,his,face,and,show,him,the,door,and,never,never,speak,to,him,again,<END>
but,no,of,course,she,couldn't,do,that,<END>
she,could,never,never,let,him,know,she,even,realized,that,bad,women,existed,much,less,that,he,visited,them,<END>
a,lady,could,never,do,that,<END>
oh,she,thought,in,fury,<END>
if,i,just,wasn't,a,lady,what,wouldn't,i,tell,that,varmint,<END>
and,crumbling,the,handkerchief,in,her,hand,she,went,down,the,stairs,to,the,kitchen,in,search,of,uncle,peter,<END>

it,would,have,been,so,much,better,for,the,yankees,to,pay,for,the,darkies,or,even,for,us,to,give,them,the,darkies,free,of,charge,than,to,have,this,happen,<END>
it,isn't,the,darkies,scarlett,<END>

how,is,she,<END>

not,a,tear,said,melanie,<END>
it's,terrible,when,women,can't,cry,<END>
i,don't,know,how,men,stand,things,without,crying,<END>
i,guess,it's,because,they're,stronger,and,braver,than,women,<END>

the,doctor,can't,leave,the,hospital,<END>

melanie,looked,sad,but,tranquil,though,tears,dropped,down,on,the,cloth,she,held,in,her,hands,<END>
evidently,she,had,not,thought,that,the,battle,might,still,be,going,on,and,ashley,perhaps,dead,at,this,very,moment,<END>
with,panic,in,her,heart,scarlett,did,not,know,whether,to,tell,melanie,of,rhett's,words,and,have,the,dubious,comfort,of,her,misery,or,keep,it,to,herself,<END>
finally,she,decided,to,remain,quiet,<END>
it,would,never,do,for,melanie,to,think,her,too,worried,about,ashley,<END>

after,an,interval,of,silent,sewing,they,heard,sounds,outside,and,peering,through,the,curtains,they,saw,dr,meade,alighting,from,his,horse,<END>
his,shoulders,were,sagging,and,his,head,bowed,until,his,gray,beard,spread,out,fanlike,on,his,chest,<END>
he,came,slowly,into,the,house,and,laying,down,his,hat,and,bag,kissed,both,the,girls,silently,<END>

in,a,moment,phil,came,down,all,long,legs,and,arms,and,awkwardness,<END>
the,two,girls,looked,an,invitation,to,join,them,but,he,went,onto,the,front,porch,and,seating,himself,on,the,top,step,dropped,his,head,on,his,cupped,palm,<END>
melly,sighed,<END>
he's,mad,because,they,won't,let,him,go,fight,the,yankees,<END>

and,have,him,get,killed,said,scarlett,shortly,thinking,of,darcy,<END>
it,would,be,better,to,have,a,son,even,if,he,did,get,killed,than,to,never,have,one,said,melanie,and,gulped,<END>
you,can't,understand,scarlett,because,you've,got,little,wade,but,i,oh,scarlett,i,want,a,baby,so,bad,<END>

he,was,home,again,separated,from,her,only,by,the,width,of,the,parlor,rug,and,it,took,all,her,strength,not,to,dissolve,in,happy,tears,every,time,she,looked,at,him,sitting,there,on,the,sofa,with,melly,on,one,side,and,india,on,the,other,and,honey,hanging,over,his,shoulder,<END>

ashley,was,home,at,last,<END>
now,and,then,she,put,her,hand,up,to,her,cheek,where,he,had,kissed,her,and,felt,again,the,thrill,of,his,lips,and,smiled,at,him,<END>
he,had,not,kissed,her,first,of,course,<END>

and,then,india,and,honey,had,hugged,him,fairly,tearing,him,from,melanie's,arms,<END>
then,he,had,kissed,his,father,with,a,dignified,affectionate,embrace,that,showed,the,strong,quiet,feeling,that,lay,between,them,<END>
and,then,aunt,pitty,who,was,jumping,up,and,down,on,her,inadequate,little,feet,with,excitement,<END>
finally,he,turned,to,her,surrounded,by,all,the,boys,who,were,claiming,their,kisses,and,said,oh,scarlett,<END>
you,pretty,pretty,thing,<END>
and,kissed,her,on,the,cheek,<END>

not,until,hours,later,did,she,recall,that,he,had,not,kissed,her,on,the,lips,<END>
then,she,wondered,feverishly,if,he,would,have,done,it,had,she,met,him,alone,bending,his,tall,body,over,hers,pulling,her,up,on,tiptoe,holding,her,for,a,long,long,time,<END>
and,because,it,made,her,happy,to,think,so,she,believed,that,he,would,<END>
but,there,would,be,time,for,all,things,a,whole,week,<END>
surely,she,could,maneuver,to,get,him,alone,and,say,do,you,remember,those,rides,we,used,to,take,down,our,secret,bridle,paths,<END>
do,you,remember,how,the,moon,looked,that,night,when,we,sat,on,the,steps,at,tara,and,you,quoted,that,poem,<END>

so,many,dear,memories,that,would,bring,back,to,him,those,lovely,days,when,they,roamed,the,county,like,care-free,children,so,many,things,that,would,call,to,mind,the,days,before,melanie,hamilton,entered,on,the,scene,<END>
and,while,they,talked,she,could,perhaps,read,in,his,eyes,some,quickening,of,emotion,some,hint,that,behind,the,barrier,of,husbandly,affection,for,melanie,he,still,cared,cared,as,passionately,as,on,that,day,of,the,barbecue,when,he,burst,forth,with,the,truth,<END>
it,did,not,occur,to,her,to,plan,just,what,they,would,do,if,ashley,should,declare,his,love,for,her,in,unmistakable,words,<END>

her,time,would,come,<END>
after,all,what,did,a,girl,like,melanie,know,of,love,<END>

about,the,blue,cloth,when,it,comes,to,a,choice,between,having,holes,in,your,britches,or,patching,them,with,pieces,of,a,captured,yankee,uniform,well,there,just,isn't,any,choice,<END>

they're,two,sizes,too,small,and,they're,killing,me,this,minute,<END>
but,i'm,going,home,in,style,just,the,same,<END>

i,claimed,them,first,said,tony,beginning,to,scowl,at,his,brother,and,melanie,fluttering,with,fear,at,the,possibility,of,one,of,the,famous,fontaine,quarrels,interposed,and,made,peace,<END>
i,had,a,full,beard,to,show,you,girls,said,ashley,ruefully,rubbing,his,face,where,half-healed,razor,nicks,still,showed,<END>
it,was,a,beautiful,beard,and,if,i,do,say,it,myself,neither,jeb,stuart,nor,nathan,bedford,forrest,had,a,handsomer,one,<END>

they,got,me,down,and,shaved,me,and,it's,a,wonder,my,head,didn't,come,off,along,with,the,beard,<END>

you,ought,to,thank,me,<END>
you'd,never,have,recognized,him,and,wouldn't,have,let,him,in,the,door,said,alex,<END>

if,you,say,the,word,we'll,take,the,mustache,off,for,you,right,now,<END>
oh,no,thank,you,<END>
said,melanie,hastily,clutching,ashley,in,a,frightened,way,for,the,two,swarthy,little,men,looked,capable,of,any,violence,<END>
i,think,it's,perfectly,lovely,<END>
that's,love,said,the,fontaines,nodding,gravely,at,each,other,<END>
when,ashley,went,into,the,cold,to,see,the,boys,off,to,the,depot,in,aunt,pitty's,carriage,melanie,caught,scarlett's,arm,<END>
isn't,his,uniform,dreadful,<END>
won't,my,coat,be,a,surprise,<END>
oh,if,only,i,had,enough,cloth,for,britches,too,<END>
that,coat,for,ashley,was,a,sore,subject,with,scarlett,for,she,wished,so,ardently,that,she,and,not,melanie,were,bestowing,it,as,a,christmas,gift,<END>
gray,wool,for,uniforms,was,now,almost,literally,more,priceless,than,rubies,and,ashley,was,wearing,the,familiar,homespun,<END>
even,butternut,was,now,none,too,plentiful,and,many,of,the,soldiers,were,dressed,in,captured,yankee,uniforms,which,had,been,turned,a,dark-brown,color,with,walnut-shell,dye,<END>
but,melanie,by,rare,luck,had,come,into,possession,of,enough,gray,broadcloth,to,make,a,coat,a,rather,short,coat,but,a,coat,just,the,same,<END>
she,had,nursed,a,charleston,boy,in,the,hospital,and,when,he,died,had,clipped,a,lock,of,his,hair,and,sent,it,to,his,mother,along,with,the,scant,contents,of,his,pockets,and,a,comforting,account,of,his,last,hours,which,made,no,mention,of,the,torment,in,which,he,died,<END>
a,correspondence,had,sprung,up,between,them,and,learning,that,melanie,had,a,husband,at,the,front,the,mother,had,sent,her,the,length,of,gray,cloth,and,brass,buttons,which,she,had,bought,for,her,dead,son,<END>
it,was,a,beautiful,piece,of,material,thick,and,warm,and,with,a,dull,sheen,to,it,undoubtedly,blockade,goods,and,undoubtedly,very,expensive,<END>
it,was,now,in,the,hands,of,the,tailor,and,melanie,was,hurrying,him,to,have,it,ready,by,christmas,morning,<END>
scarlett,would,have,given,anything,to,be,able,to,provide,the,rest,of,the,uniform,but,the,necessary,materials,were,simply,not,to,be,had,in,atlanta,<END>
she,had,a,christmas,present,for,ashley,but,it,paled,in,insignificance,beside,the,glory,of,melanie's,gray,coat,<END>
it,was,a,small,housewife,made,of,flannel,containing,the,whole,precious,pack,of,needles,rhett,had,brought,her,from,nassau,three,of,her,linen,handkerchiefs,obtained,from,the,same,source,two,spools,of,thread,and,a,small,pair,of,scissors,<END>
but,she,wanted,to,give,him,something,more,personal,something,a,wife,could,give,a,husband,a,shirt,a,pair,of,gauntlets,a,hat,<END>
oh,yes,a,hat,by,all,means,<END>
that,little,flat-topped,forage,cap,ashley,was,wearing,looked,ridiculous,<END>
scarlett,had,always,hated,them,<END>
what,if,stonewall,jackson,had,worn,one,in,preference,to,a,slouch,felt,<END>
that,didn't,make,them,any,more,dignified,looking,<END>
but,the,only,hats,obtainable,in,atlanta,were,crudely,made,wool,hats,and,they,were,tackier,than,the,monkey-hat,forage,caps,<END>
when,she,thought,of,hats,she,thought,of,rhett,butler,<END>
he,had,so,many,hats,wide,panamas,for,summer,tall,beavers,for,formal,occasions,hunting,hats,slouch,hats,of,tan,and,black,and,blue,<END>
what,need,had,he,for,so,many,when,her,darling,ashley,rode,in,the,rain,with,moisture,dripping,down,his,collar,from,the,back,of,his,cap,<END>
i'll,make,rhett,give,me,that,new,black,felt,of,his,she,decided,<END>
and,i'll,put,a,gray,ribbon,around,the,brim,and,sew,ashley's,wreath,on,it,and,it,will,look,lovely,<END>
she,paused,and,thought,it,might,be,difficult,to,get,the,hat,without,some,explanation,<END>
she,simply,could,not,tell,rhett,she,wanted,it,for,ashley,<END>
he,would,raise,his,brows,in,that,nasty,way,he,always,had,when,she,even,mentioned,ashley's,name,and,like,as,not,would,refuse,to,give,her,the,hat,<END>
well,she'd,make,up,some,pitiful,story,about,a,soldier,in,the,hospital,who,needed,it,and,rhett,need,never,know,the,truth,<END>
all,that,afternoon,she,maneuvered,to,be,alone,with,ashley,even,for,a,few,minutes,but,melanie,was,beside,him,constantly,and,india,and,honey,their,pale,lashless,eyes,glowing,followed,him,about,the,house,<END>
even,john,wilkes,visibly,proud,of,his,son,had,no,opportunity,for,quiet,conversation,with,him,<END>
it,was,the,same,at,supper,where,they,all,plied,him,with,questions,about,the,war,<END>
the,war,<END>
who,cared,about,the,war,<END>
scarlett,didn't,think,ashley,cared,very,much,for,that,subject,either,<END>
he,talked,at,length,laughed,frequently,and,dominated,the,conversation,more,completely,than,she,had,ever,seen,him,do,before,but,he,seemed,to,say,very,little,<END>
he,told,them,jokes,and,funny,stories,about,friends,talked,gaily,about,makeshifts,making,light,of,hunger,and,long,marches,in,the,rain,and,described,in,detail,how,general,lee,had,looked,when,he,rode,by,on,the,retreat,from,gettysburg,and,questioned,gentlemen,are,you,georgia,troops,<END>
well,we,can't,get,along,without,you,georgians,<END>
it,seemed,to,scarlett,that,he,was,talking,fervishly,to,keep,them,from,asking,questions,he,did,not,want,to,answer,<END>
when,she,saw,his,eyes,falter,and,drop,before,the,long,troubled,gaze,of,his,father,a,faint,worry,and,bewilderment,rose,in,her,as,to,what,was,hidden,in,ashley's,heart,<END>
but,it,soon,passed,for,there,was,no,room,in,her,mind,for,anything,except,a,radiant,happiness,and,a,driving,desire,to,be,alone,with,him,<END>
that,radiance,lasted,until,everyone,in,the,circle,about,the,open,fire,began,to,yawn,and,mr,wilkes,and,the,girls,took,their,departure,for,the,hotel,<END>
then,as,ashley,and,melanie,and,pittypat,and,scarlett,mounted,the,stairs,lighted,by,uncle,peter,a,chill,fell,on,her,spirit,<END>
until,that,moment,when,they,stood,in,the,upstairs,hall,ashley,had,been,hers,only,hers,even,if,she,had,not,had,a,private,word,with,him,that,whole,afternoon,<END>
but,now,as,she,said,good,night,she,saw,that,melanie's,cheeks,were,suddenly,crimson,and,she,was,trembling,<END>
her,eyes,were,on,the,carpet,and,though,she,seemed,overcome,with,some,frightening,emotion,she,seemed,shyly,happy,<END>
melanie,did,not,even,look,up,when,ashley,opened,the,bedroom,door,but,sped,inside,<END>
ashley,said,good,night,abruptly,and,he,did,not,meet,scarlett's,eyes,either,<END>
the,door,closed,behind,them,leaving,scarlett,open,mouthed,and,suddenly,desolate,<END>
ashley,was,no,longer,hers,<END>
he,was,melanie's,<END>
and,as,long,as,melanie,lived,she,could,go,into,rooms,with,ashley,and,close,the,door,and,close,out,the,rest,of,the,world,<END>
now,ashley,was,going,away,back,to,virginia,back,to,the,long,marches,in,the,sleet,to,hungry,bivouacs,in,the,snow,to,pain,and,hardship,and,to,the,risk,of,all,the,bright,beauty,of,his,golden,head,and,proud,slender,body,being,blotted,out,in,an,instant,like,an,ant,beneath,a,careless,heel,<END>
the,past,week,with,its,shimmering,dreamlike,beauty,its,crowded,hours,of,happiness,was,gone,<END>
the,week,had,passed,swiftly,like,a,dream,a,dream,fragrant,with,the,smell,of,pine,boughs,and,christmas,trees,bright,with,little,candles,and,home-made,tinsel,a,dream,where,minutes,flew,as,rapidly,as,heartbeats,<END>
such,a,breathless,week,when,something,within,her,drove,scarlett,with,mingled,pain,and,pleasure,to,pack,and,cram,every,minute,with,incidents,to,remember,after,he,was,gone,happenings,which,she,could,examine,at,leisure,in,the,long,months,ahead,extracting,every,morsel,of,comfort,from,them,dance,sing,laugh,fetch,and,carry,for,ashley,anticipate,his,wants,smile,when,he,smiles,be,silent,when,he,talks,follow,him,with,your,eyes,so,that,each,line,of,his,erect,body,each,lift,of,his,eyebrows,each,quirk,of,his,mouth,will,be,indelibly,printed,on,your,mind,for,a,week,goes,by,so,fast,and,the,war,goes,on,forever,<END>
she,sat,on,the,divan,in,the,parlor,holding,her,going-away,gift,for,him,in,her,lap,waiting,while,he,said,good-by,to,melanie,praying,that,when,he,did,come,down,the,stairs,he,would,be,alone,and,she,might,be,granted,by,heaven,a,few,moments,alone,with,him,<END>
her,ears,strained,for,sounds,from,upstairs,but,the,house,was,oddly,still,so,still,that,even,the,sound,of,her,breathing,seemed,loud,<END>
aunt,pittypat,was,crying,into,her,pillows,in,her,room,for,ashley,had,told,her,good-by,half,an,hour,before,<END>
no,sounds,of,murmuring,voices,or,of,tears,came,from,behind,the,closed,door,of,melanie's,bedroom,<END>
it,seemed,to,scarlett,that,he,had,been,in,that,room,for,hours,and,she,resented,bitterly,each,moment,that,he,stayed,saying,good-by,to,his,wife,for,the,moments,were,slipping,by,so,fast,and,his,time,was,so,short,<END>
she,thought,of,all,the,things,she,had,intended,to,say,to,him,during,this,week,<END>
but,there,had,been,no,opportunity,to,say,them,and,she,knew,now,that,perhaps,she,would,never,have,the,chance,to,say,them,<END>
such,foolish,little,things,some,of,them,ashley,you,will,be,careful,won't,you,<END>
please,don't,get,your,feet,wet,<END>
you,take,cold,so,easily,<END>
don't,forget,to,put,a,newspaper,across,your,chest,under,your,shirt,<END>
it,keeps,out,the,wind,so,well,<END>
but,there,were,other,things,more,important,things,she,had,wanted,to,say,much,more,important,things,she,had,wanted,to,hear,him,say,things,she,had,wanted,to,read,in,his,eyes,even,if,he,did,not,speak,them,<END>
so,many,things,to,say,and,now,there,was,no,time,<END>
even,the,few,minutes,that,remained,might,be,snatched,away,from,her,if,melanie,followed,him,to,the,door,to,the,carriage,block,<END>
why,hadn't,she,made,the,opportunity,during,this,last,week,<END>
but,always,melanie,was,at,his,side,her,eyes,caressing,him,adoringly,always,friends,and,neighbors,and,relatives,were,in,the,house,and,from,morning,till,night,ashley,was,never,alone,<END>
then,at,night,the,door,of,the,bedroom,closed,and,he,was,alone,with,melanie,<END>
never,once,during,these,last,days,had,he,betrayed,to,scarlett,by,one,look,one,word,anything,but,the,affection,a,brother,might,show,a,sister,or,a,friend,a,lifelong,friend,<END>
she,could,not,let,him,go,away,perhaps,forever,without,knowing,whether,he,still,loved,her,<END>
then,even,if,he,died,she,could,nurse,the,warm,comfort,of,his,secret,love,to,the,end,of,her,days,<END>
after,what,seemed,an,eternity,of,waiting,she,heard,the,sound,of,his,boots,in,the,bedroom,above,and,the,door,opening,and,closing,<END>

alone,<END>
thank,god,for,that,<END>
melanie,must,be,too,overcome,by,the,grief,of,parting,to,leave,her,room,<END>
now,she,would,have,him,for,herself,for,a,few,precious,minutes,<END>
he,came,down,the,steps,slowly,his,spurs,clinking,and,she,could,hear,the,slap-slap,of,his,saber,against,his,high,boots,<END>
when,he,came,into,the,parlor,his,eyes,were,somber,<END>
he,was,trying,to,smile,but,his,face,was,as,white,and,drawn,as,a,man,bleeding,from,an,internal,wound,<END>
she,rose,as,he,entered,thinking,with,proprietary,pride,that,he,was,the,handsomest,soldier,she,had,ever,seen,<END>
his,long,holster,and,belt,glistened,and,his,silver,spurs,and,scabbard,gleamed,from,the,industrious,polishing,uncle,peter,had,given,them,<END>
his,new,coat,did,not,fit,very,well,for,the,tailor,had,been,hurried,and,some,of,the,seams,were,awry,<END>
the,bright,new,sheen,of,the,gray,coat,was,sadly,at,variance,with,the,worn,and,patched,butternut,trousers,and,the,scarred,boots,but,if,he,had,been,clothed,in,silver,armor,he,could,not,have,looked,more,the,shining,knight,to,her,<END>
ashley,she,begged,abruptly,may,i,go,to,the,train,with,you,<END>
please,don't,<END>
father,and,the,girls,will,be,there,<END>
and,anyway,i'd,rather,remember,you,saying,good-by,to,me,here,than,shivering,at,the,depot,<END>
there's,so,much,to,memories,<END>
instantly,she,abandoned,her,plan,<END>
if,india,and,honey,who,disliked,her,so,much,were,to,be,present,at,the,leave,taking,she,would,have,no,chance,for,a,private,word,<END>
then,i,won't,go,she,said,<END>
see,ashley,<END>
i've,another,present,for,you,<END>
a,little,shy,now,that,the,time,had,come,to,give,it,to,him,she,unrolled,the,package,<END>
it,was,a,long,yellow,sash,made,of,thick,china,silk,and,edged,with,heavy,fringe,<END>
rhett,butler,had,brought,her,a,yellow,shawl,from,havana,several,months,before,a,shawl,gaudily,embroidered,with,birds,and,flowers,in,magenta,and,blue,<END>
during,this,last,week,she,had,patiently,picked,out,all,the,embroidery,and,cut,up,the,square,of,silk,and,stitched,it,into,a,sash,length,<END>
scarlett,it's,beautiful,<END>
did,you,make,it,yourself,<END>
then,i'll,value,it,all,the,more,<END>
put,it,on,me,my,dear,<END>
the,boys,will,be,green,with,envy,when,they,see,me,in,the,glory,of,my,new,coat,and,sash,<END>
she,wrapped,the,bright,lengths,about,his,slender,waist,above,his,belt,and,tied,the,ends,in,a,lover's,knot,<END>
melanie,might,have,given,him,his,new,coat,but,this,sash,was,her,gift,her,own,secret,guerdon,for,him,to,wear,into,battle,something,that,would,make,him,remember,her,every,time,he,looked,at,it,<END>
she,stood,back,and,viewed,him,with,pride,thinking,that,even,jeb,stuart,with,his,flaunting,sash,and,plume,could,not,look,so,dashing,as,her,cavalier,<END>
it's,beautiful,he,repeated,fingering,the,fringe,<END>
but,i,know,you've,cut,up,a,dress,or,a,shawl,to,make,it,<END>
you,shouldn't,have,done,it,scarlett,<END>
pretty,things,are,too,hard,to,get,these,days,<END>
oh,ashley,i'd,<END>
she,had,started,to,say,i'd,cut,up,my,heart,for,you,to,wear,if,you,wanted,it,but,she,finished,i'd,do,anything,for,you,<END>
would,you,<END>
he,questioned,and,some,of,the,somberness,lifted,from,his,face,<END>
then,there's,something,you,can,do,for,me,scarlett,something,that,will,make,my,mind,easier,when,i'm,away,<END>
what,is,it,<END>
she,asked,joyfully,ready,to,promise,prodigies,<END>
scarlett,will,you,look,after,melanie,for,me,<END>
look,after,melly,<END>
her,heart,sank,with,bitter,disappointment,<END>
so,this,was,something,beautiful,something,spectacular,<END>
and,then,anger,flared,<END>
this,moment,was,her,moment,with,ashley,hers,alone,<END>
and,yet,though,melanie,was,absent,her,pale,shadow,lay,between,them,<END>
how,could,he,bring,up,her,name,in,their,moment,of,farewell,<END>
how,could,he,ask,such,a,thing,of,her,<END>
he,did,not,notice,the,disappointment,on,her,face,<END>
as,of,old,his,eyes,were,looking,through,her,and,beyond,her,at,something,else,not,seeing,her,at,all,<END>
yes,keep,an,eye,on,her,take,care,of,her,<END>
she's,so,frail,and,she,doesn't,realize,it,<END>
she'll,wear,herself,out,nursing,and,sewing,<END>
and,she's,so,gentle,and,timid,<END>
except,for,aunt,pittypat,and,uncle,henry,and,you,she,hasn't,a,close,relative,in,the,world,except,the,burrs,in,macon,and,they're,third,cousins,<END>
and,aunt,pitty,scarlett,you,know,she's,like,a,child,<END>
and,uncle,henry,is,an,old,man,<END>
melanie,loves,you,so,much,not,just,because,you,were,charlie's,wife,but,because,well,because,you're,you,and,she,loves,you,like,a,sister,<END>
scarlett,i,have,nightmares,when,i,think,what,might,happen,to,her,if,i,were,killed,and,she,had,no,one,to,turn,to,<END>
will,you,promise,<END>
she,did,not,even,hear,his,last,request,so,terrified,was,she,by,those,ill-omened,words,if,i,were,killed,<END>
every,day,she,had,read,the,casualty,lists,read,them,with,her,heart,in,her,throat,knowing,that,the,world,would,end,if,anything,should,happen,to,him,<END>
but,always,always,she,had,an,inner,feeling,that,even,if,the,confederate,army,were,entirely,wiped,out,ashley,would,be,spared,<END>
and,now,he,had,spoken,the,frightful,words,<END>
goose,bumps,came,out,all,over,her,and,fear,swamped,her,a,superstitious,fear,she,could,not,combat,with,reason,<END>
she,was,irish,enough,to,believe,in,second,sight,especially,where,death,premonitions,were,concerned,and,in,his,wide,gray,eyes,she,saw,some,deep,sadness,which,she,could,only,interpret,as,that,of,a,man,who,has,felt,the,cold,finger,on,his,shoulder,has,heard,the,wail,of,the,banshee,<END>
you,mustn't,say,it,<END>
you,mustn't,even,think,it,<END>
it's,bad,luck,to,speak,of,death,<END>
oh,say,a,prayer,quickly,<END>
you,say,it,for,me,and,light,some,candles,too,he,said,smiling,at,the,frightened,urgency,in,her,voice,<END>
but,she,could,not,answer,so,stricken,was,she,by,the,pictures,her,mind,was,drawing,ashley,lying,dead,in,the,snows,of,virginia,so,far,away,from,her,<END>
he,went,on,speaking,and,there,was,a,quality,in,his,voice,a,sadness,a,resignation,that,increased,her,fear,until,every,vestige,of,anger,and,disappointment,was,blotted,out,<END>
i'm,asking,you,for,this,reason,scarlett,<END>
i,cannot,tell,what,will,happen,to,me,or,what,will,happen,to,any,of,us,<END>
but,when,the,end,comes,i,shall,be,far,away,from,here,even,if,i,am,alive,too,far,away,to,look,out,for,melanie,<END>
the,the,end,<END>
the,end,of,the,war,and,the,end,of,the,world,<END>
but,ashley,surely,you,can't,think,the,yankees,will,beat,us,<END>
all,this,week,you've,talked,about,how,strong,general,lee,<END>
all,this,week,i've,talked,lies,like,all,men,talk,when,they're,on,furlough,<END>
why,should,i,frighten,melanie,and,aunt,pitty,before,there's,any,need,for,them,to,be,frightened,<END>
yes,scarlett,i,think,the,yankees,have,us,<END>
gettysburg,was,the,beginning,of,the,end,<END>
the,people,back,home,don't,know,it,yet,<END>
they,can't,realize,how,things,stand,with,us,but,scarlett,some,of,my,men,are,barefooted,now,and,the,snow,is,deep,in,virginia,<END>
and,when,i,see,their,poor,frozen,feet,wrapped,in,rags,and,old,sacks,and,i,see,the,blood,prints,they,leave,in,the,snow,and,know,that,i've,got,a,whole,pair,of,boots,well,i,feel,like,i,should,give,mine,away,and,be,barefooted,too,<END>
oh,ashley,promise,me,you,won't,give,them,away,<END>
when,i,see,things,like,that,and,then,look,at,the,yankees,then,i,see,the,end,of,everything,<END>
why,scarlett,the,yankees,are,buying,soldiers,from,europe,by,the,thousands,<END>
most,of,the,prisoners,we've,taken,recently,can't,even,speak,english,<END>
they're,germans,and,poles,and,wild,irishmen,who,talk,gaelic,<END>
but,when,we,lose,a,man,he,can't,be,replaced,<END>
when,our,shoes,wear,out,there,are,no,more,shoes,<END>
we're,bottled,up,scarlett,<END>
and,we,can't,fight,the,whole,world,<END>
she,thought,wildly,let,the,whole,confederacy,crumble,in,the,dust,<END>
let,the,world,end,but,you,must,not,die,<END>
i,couldn't,live,if,you,were,dead,<END>
i,hope,you,will,not,repeat,what,i,have,said,scarlett,<END>
i,do,not,want,to,alarm,the,others,<END>
and,my,dear,i,would,not,have,alarmed,you,by,saying,these,things,were,it,not,that,i,had,to,explain,why,i,ask,you,to,look,after,melanie,<END>
she's,so,frail,and,weak,and,you're,so,strong,scarlett,<END>
it,will,be,a,comfort,to,me,to,know,that,you,are,together,if,anything,happens,to,me,<END>
you,will,promise,won't,you,<END>
oh,yes,<END>
she,cried,for,at,that,moment,seeing,death,at,his,elbow,she,would,have,promised,anything,<END>
ashley,ashley,<END>
i,can't,let,you,go,away,<END>
i,simply,can't,be,brave,about,it,<END>
you,must,be,brave,he,said,and,his,voice,changed,subtly,<END>
it,was,resonant,deeper,and,his,words,fell,swiftly,as,though,hurried,with,some,inner,urgency,<END>
you,must,be,brave,<END>
for,how,else,can,i,stand,it,<END>
her,eyes,sought,his,face,quickly,and,with,joy,wondering,if,he,meant,that,leaving,her,was,breaking,his,heart,even,as,it,was,breaking,hers,<END>
his,face,was,as,drawn,as,when,he,came,down,from,bidding,melanie,good-by,but,she,could,read,nothing,in,his,eyes,<END>
he,leaned,down,took,her,face,in,his,hands,and,kissed,her,lightly,on,the,forehead,<END>
scarlett,<END>
scarlett,<END>
you,are,so,fine,and,strong,and,good,<END>
so,beautiful,not,just,your,sweet,face,my,dear,but,all,of,you,your,body,and,your,mind,and,your,soul,<END>
oh,ashley,she,whispered,happily,thrilling,at,his,words,and,his,touch,on,her,face,<END>
nobody,else,but,you,ever,<END>
i,like,to,think,that,perhaps,i,know,you,better,than,most,people,and,that,i,can,see,beautiful,things,buried,deep,in,you,that,others,are,too,careless,and,too,hurried,to,notice,<END>
he,stopped,speaking,and,his,hands,dropped,from,her,face,but,his,eyes,still,clung,to,her,eyes,<END>
she,waited,a,moment,breathless,for,him,to,continue,a-tiptoe,to,hear,him,say,the,magic,three,words,<END>
but,they,did,not,come,<END>
she,searched,his,face,frantically,her,lips,quivering,for,she,saw,he,had,finished,speaking,<END>
this,second,blighting,of,her,hopes,was,more,than,heart,could,bear,and,she,cried,oh,<END>
in,a,childish,whisper,and,sat,down,tears,stinging,her,eyes,<END>
then,she,heard,an,ominous,sound,in,the,driveway,outside,the,window,a,sound,that,brought,home,to,her,even,more,sharply,the,imminence,of,ashley's,departure,<END>
a,pagan,hearing,the,lapping,of,the,waters,around,charon's,boat,could,not,have,felt,more,desolate,<END>
uncle,peter,muffled,in,a,quilt,was,bringing,out,the,carriage,to,take,ashley,to,the,train,<END>
ashley,said,good-by,very,softly,caught,up,from,the,table,the,wide,felt,hat,she,had,inveigled,from,rhett,and,walked,into,the,dark,front,hall,<END>
his,hand,on,the,doorknob,he,turned,and,looked,at,her,a,long,desperate,look,as,if,he,wanted,to,carry,away,with,him,every,detail,of,her,face,and,figure,<END>
through,a,blinding,mist,of,tears,she,saw,his,face,and,with,a,strangling,pain,in,her,throat,she,knew,that,he,was,going,away,away,from,her,care,away,from,the,safe,haven,of,this,house,and,out,of,her,life,perhaps,forever,without,having,spoken,the,words,she,so,yearned,to,hear,<END>
time,was,going,by,like,a,mill,race,and,now,it,was,too,late,<END>
she,ran,stumbling,across,the,parlor,and,into,the,hall,and,clutched,the,ends,of,his,sash,<END>
kiss,me,she,whispered,<END>
kiss,me,good-by,<END>
his,arms,went,around,her,gently,and,he,bent,his,head,to,her,face,<END>
at,the,first,touch,of,his,lips,on,hers,her,arms,were,about,his,neck,in,a,strangling,grip,<END>
for,a,fleeting,immeasurable,instant,he,pressed,her,body,close,to,his,<END>
then,she,felt,a,sudden,tensing,of,all,his,muscles,<END>
swiftly,he,dropped,the,hat,to,the,floor,and,reaching,up,detached,her,arms,from,his,neck,<END>
no,scarlett,no,he,said,in,a,low,voice,holding,her,crossed,wrists,in,a,grip,that,hurt,<END>
i,love,you,she,said,choking,<END>
i've,always,loved,you,<END>
i've,never,loved,anybody,else,<END>
i,just,married,charlie,to,to,try,to,hurt,you,<END>
oh,ashley,i,love,you,so,much,i'd,walk,every,step,of,the,way,to,virginia,just,to,be,near,you,<END>
and,i'd,cook,for,you,and,polish,your,boots,and,groom,your,horse,ashley,say,you,love,me,<END>
i'll,live,on,it,for,the,rest,of,my,life,<END>
he,bent,suddenly,to,retrieve,his,hat,and,she,had,one,glimpse,of,his,face,<END>
it,was,the,unhappiest,face,she,was,ever,to,see,a,face,from,which,all,aloofness,had,fled,<END>
written,on,it,were,his,love,for,and,joy,that,she,loved,him,but,battling,them,both,were,shame,and,despair,<END>
good-by,he,said,hoarsely,<END>
the,door,clicked,open,and,a,gust,of,cold,wind,swept,the,house,fluttering,the,curtains,<END>
scarlett,shivered,as,she,watched,him,run,down,the,walk,to,the,carriage,his,saber,glinting,in,the,feeble,winter,sunlight,the,fringe,of,his,sash,dancing,jauntily,<END>
chapter,xvi,<END>
january,and,february,of,1864,passed,full,of,cold,rains,and,wild,winds,clouded,by,pervasive,gloom,and,depression,<END>
in,addition,to,the,defeats,at,gettysburg,and,vicksburg,the,center,of,the,southern,line,had,caved,<END>
after,hard,fighting,nearly,all,of,tennessee,was,now,held,by,the,union,troops,<END>
but,even,with,this,loss,on,the,top,of,the,others,the,south's,spirit,was,not,broken,<END>
true,grim,determination,had,taken,the,place,of,high-hearted,hopes,but,people,could,still,find,a,silver,lining,in,the,cloud,<END>
for,one,thing,the,yankees,had,been,stoutly,repulsed,in,september,when,they,had,tried,to,follow,up,their,victories,in,tennessee,by,an,advance,into,georgia,<END>
here,in,the,northwesternmost,corner,of,the,state,at,chickamauga,serious,fighting,had,occurred,on,georgia,soil,for,the,first,time,since,the,war,began,<END>
the,yankees,had,taken,chattanooga,and,then,had,marched,through,the,mountain,passes,into,georgia,but,they,had,been,driven,back,with,heavy,losses,<END>
atlanta,and,its,railroads,had,played,a,big,part,in,making,chickamauga,a,great,victory,for,the,south,<END>
over,the,railroads,that,led,down,from,virginia,to,atlanta,and,then,northward,to,tennessee,general,longstreet's,corps,had,been,rushed,to,the,scene,of,the,battle,<END>
along,the,entire,route,of,several,hundred,miles,the,tracks,had,been,cleared,and,all,the,available,rolling,stock,in,the,southeast,had,been,assembled,for,the,movement,<END>
atlanta,had,watched,while,train,after,train,rolled,through,the,town,hour,after,hour,passenger,coaches,box,cars,flat,cars,filled,with,shouting,men,<END>
they,had,come,without,food,or,sleep,without,their,horses,ambulances,or,supply,trains,and,without,waiting,for,the,rest,they,had,leaped,from,the,trains,and,into,the,battle,<END>
and,the,yankees,had,been,driven,out,of,georgia,back,into,tennessee,<END>
it,was,the,greatest,feat,of,the,war,and,atlanta,took,pride,and,personal,satisfaction,in,the,thought,that,its,railroads,had,made,the,victory,possible,<END>
but,the,south,had,needed,the,cheering,news,from,chickamauga,to,strengthen,its,morale,through,the,winter,<END>
no,one,denied,now,that,the,yankees,were,good,fighters,and,at,last,they,had,good,generals,<END>
grant,was,a,butcher,who,did,not,care,how,many,men,he,slaughtered,for,a,victory,but,victory,he,would,have,<END>
sheridan,was,a,name,to,bring,dread,to,southern,hearts,<END>
and,then,there,was,a,man,named,sherman,who,was,being,mentioned,more,and,more,often,<END>
he,had,risen,to,prominence,in,the,campaigns,in,tennessee,and,the,west,and,his,reputation,as,a,determined,and,ruthless,fighter,was,growing,<END>
none,of,them,of,course,compared,with,general,lee,<END>
faith,in,the,general,and,the,army,was,still,strong,<END>
confidence,in,ultimate,victory,never,wavered,<END>
but,the,war,was,dragging,out,so,long,<END>
there,were,so,many,dead,so,many,wounded,and,maimed,for,life,so,many,widowed,so,many,orphaned,<END>
and,there,was,still,a,long,struggle,ahead,which,meant,more,dead,more,wounded,more,widows,and,orphans,<END>
to,make,matters,worse,a,vague,distrust,of,those,in,high,places,had,begun,to,creep,over,the,civilian,population,<END>
many,newspapers,were,outspoken,in,their,denunciation,of,president,davis,himself,and,the,manner,in,which,he,prosecuted,the,war,<END>
there,were,dissensions,within,the,confederate,cabinet,disagreements,between,president,davis,and,his,generals,<END>
the,currency,was,falling,rapidly,<END>
shoes,and,clothing,for,the,army,were,scarce,ordnance,supplies,and,drugs,were,scarcer,<END>
the,railroads,needed,new,cars,to,take,the,place,of,old,ones,and,new,iron,rails,to,replace,those,torn,up,by,the,yankees,<END>
the,generals,in,the,field,were,crying,out,for,fresh,troops,and,there,were,fewer,and,fewer,fresh,troops,to,be,had,<END>
worst,of,all,some,of,the,state,governors,governor,brown,of,georgia,among,them,were,refusing,to,send,state,militia,troops,and,arms,out,of,their,borders,<END>
there,were,thousands,of,able-bodied,men,in,the,state,troops,for,whom,the,army,was,frantic,but,the,government,pleaded,for,them,in,vain,<END>
with,the,new,fall,of,currency,prices,soared,again,<END>
beef,pork,and,butter,cost,thirty-five,dollars,a,pound,flour,fourteen,hundred,dollars,a,barrel,soda,one,hundred,dollars,a,pound,tea,five,hundred,dollars,a,pound,<END>
warm,clothing,when,it,was,obtainable,at,all,had,risen,to,such,prohibitive,prices,that,atlanta,ladies,were,lining,their,old,dresses,with,rags,and,reinforcing,them,with,newspapers,to,keep,out,the,wind,<END>
shoes,cost,from,two,hundred,to,eight,hundred,dollars,a,pair,depending,on,whether,they,were,made,of,cardboard,or,real,leather,<END>
ladies,now,wore,gaiters,made,of,their,old,wool,shawls,and,cut-up,carpets,<END>
the,soles,were,made,of,wood,<END>
the,truth,was,that,the,north,was,holding,the,south,in,a,virtual,state,of,siege,though,many,did,not,realize,it,<END>
the,yankee,gunboats,had,tightened,the,mesh,at,the,ports,and,very,few,ships,were,now,able,to,slip,past,the,blockade,<END>
the,south,had,always,lived,by,selling,cotton,and,buying,the,things,it,did,not,produce,but,now,it,could,neither,sell,nor,buy,<END>
gerald,o'hara,had,three,years',crops,of,cotton,stored,under,the,shed,near,the,gin,house,at,tara,but,little,good,it,did,him,<END>

throughout,the,south,most,of,the,cotton,planters,were,in,the,same,fix,<END>
with,the,blockade,closing,tighter,and,tighter,there,was,no,way,to,get,the,south's,money,crop,to,its,market,in,england,no,way,to,bring,in,the,necessaries,which,cotton,money,had,brought,in,years,gone,by,<END>
and,the,agricultural,south,waging,war,with,the,industrial,north,was,needing,so,many,things,now,things,it,had,never,thought,of,buying,in,times,of,peace,<END>
it,was,a,situation,made,to,order,for,speculators,and,profiteers,and,men,were,not,lacking,to,take,advantage,of,it,<END>
as,food,and,clothing,grew,scarcer,and,prices,rose,higher,and,higher,the,public,outcry,against,the,speculators,grew,louder,and,more,venomous,<END>
in,those,early,days,of,1864,no,newspaper,could,be,opened,that,did,not,carry,scathing,editorials,denouncing,the,speculators,as,vultures,and,bloodsucking,leeches,and,calling,upon,the,government,to,put,them,down,with,a,hard,hand,<END>

against,no,one,was,feeling,more,bitter,than,against,rhett,butler,<END>
he,had,sold,his,boats,when,blockading,grew,too,hazardous,and,he,was,now,openly,engaged,in,food,speculation,<END>
the,stories,about,him,that,came,back,to,atlanta,from,richmond,and,wilmington,made,those,who,had,received,him,in,other,days,writhe,with,shame,<END>
in,spite,of,all,these,trials,and,tribulations,atlanta's,ten,thousand,population,had,grown,to,double,that,number,during,the,war,<END>
even,the,blockade,had,added,to,atlanta's,prestige,<END>
from,time,immemorial,the,coast,cities,had,dominated,the,south,commercially,and,otherwise,<END>
but,now,with,the,ports,closed,and,many,of,the,port,cities,captured,or,besieged,the,south's,salvation,depended,upon,itself,<END>
the,interior,section,was,what,counted,if,the,south,was,going,to,win,the,war,and,atlanta,was,now,the,center,of,things,<END>
the,people,of,the,town,were,suffering,hardship,privation,sickness,and,death,as,severely,as,the,rest,of,the,confederacy,but,atlanta,the,city,had,gained,rather,than,lost,as,a,result,of,the,war,<END>
atlanta,the,heart,of,the,confederacy,was,still,beating,full,and,strong,the,railroads,that,were,its,arteries,throbbing,with,the,never-ending,flow,of,men,munitions,and,supplies,<END>
in,other,days,scarlett,would,have,been,bitter,about,her,shabby,dresses,and,patched,shoes,but,now,she,did,not,care,for,the,one,person,who,mattered,was,not,there,to,see,her,<END>
she,was,happy,those,two,months,happier,than,she,had,been,in,years,<END>
had,she,not,felt,the,start,of,ashley's,heart,when,her,arms,went,round,his,neck,<END>
seen,that,despairing,look,on,his,face,which,was,more,open,an,avowal,than,any,words,could,be,<END>
he,loved,her,<END>
she,was,sure,of,that,now,and,this,conviction,was,so,pleasant,she,could,even,be,kinder,to,melanie,<END>
she,could,be,sorry,for,melanie,now,sorry,with,a,faint,contempt,for,her,blindness,her,stupidity,<END>
when,the,war,is,over,<END>
she,thought,<END>
when,it's,over,then,<END>
sometimes,she,thought,with,a,small,dart,of,fear,what,then,<END>
but,she,put,the,thought,from,her,mind,<END>
when,the,war,was,over,everything,would,be,settled,somehow,<END>
if,ashley,loved,her,he,simply,couldn't,go,on,living,with,melanie,<END>
but,then,a,divorce,was,unthinkable,and,ellen,and,gerald,staunch,catholics,that,they,were,would,never,permit,her,to,marry,a,divorced,man,<END>
it,would,mean,leaving,the,church,<END>
scarlett,thought,it,over,and,decided,that,in,a,choice,between,the,church,and,ashley,she,would,choose,ashley,<END>
but,oh,it,would,make,such,a,scandal,<END>
divorced,people,were,under,the,ban,not,only,of,the,church,but,of,society,<END>
no,divorced,person,was,received,<END>
however,she,would,dare,even,that,for,ashley,<END>
she,would,sacrifice,anything,for,ashley,<END>
somehow,it,would,come,out,all,right,when,the,war,was,over,<END>
if,ashley,loved,her,so,much,he'd,find,a,way,<END>
she'd,make,him,find,a,way,<END>
and,with,every,day,that,passed,she,became,more,sure,in,her,own,mind,of,his,devotion,more,certain,he,would,arrange,matters,satisfactorily,when,the,yankees,were,finally,beaten,<END>
of,course,he,had,said,the,yankees,had,them,<END>
scarlett,thought,that,was,just,foolishness,<END>
he,had,been,tired,and,upset,when,he,said,it,<END>
but,she,hardly,cared,whether,the,yankees,won,or,not,<END>
the,thing,that,mattered,was,for,the,war,to,finish,quickly,and,for,ashley,to,come,home,<END>
then,when,the,sleets,of,march,were,keeping,everyone,indoors,the,hideous,blow,fell,<END>
melanie,her,eyes,shining,with,joy,her,head,ducked,with,embarrassed,pride,told,her,she,was,going,to,have,a,baby,<END>
dr,meade,says,it,will,be,here,in,late,august,or,september,she,said,<END>
i've,thought,but,i,wasn't,sure,till,today,<END>
oh,scarlett,isn't,it,wonderful,<END>
i've,so,envied,you,wade,and,so,wanted,a,baby,<END>
and,i,was,so,afraid,that,maybe,i,wasn't,ever,going,to,have,one,and,darling,i,want,a,dozen,<END>
scarlett,had,been,combing,her,hair,preparing,for,bed,when,melanie,spoke,and,she,stopped,the,comb,in,mid-air,<END>
dear,god,<END>
she,said,and,for,a,moment,realization,did,not,come,<END>
then,there,suddenly,leaped,to,her,mind,the,closed,door,of,melanie's,bedroom,and,a,knifelike,pain,went,through,her,a,pain,as,fierce,as,though,ashley,had,been,her,own,husband,and,had,been,unfaithful,to,her,<END>
a,baby,<END>
ashley's,baby,<END>
oh,how,could,he,when,he,loved,her,and,not,melanie,<END>
i,know,you're,surprised,melanie,rattled,on,breathlessly,<END>
and,isn't,it,too,wonderful,<END>
oh,scarlett,i,don't,know,how,i,shall,ever,write,ashley,<END>
it,wouldn't,be,so,embarrassing,if,i,could,tell,him,or,or,well,not,say,anything,and,just,let,him,notice,gradually,you,know,<END>
dear,god,<END>
said,scarlett,almost,sobbing,as,she,dropped,the,comb,and,caught,at,the,marble,top,of,the,dresser,for,support,<END>
darling,don't,look,like,that,<END>
you,know,having,a,baby,isn't,so,bad,<END>
you,said,so,yourself,<END>
and,you,mustn't,worry,about,me,though,you,are,sweet,to,be,so,upset,<END>
of,course,dr,meade,said,i,was,was,melanie,blushed,quite,narrow,but,that,perhaps,i,shouldn't,have,any,trouble,and,scarlett,did,you,write,charlie,and,tell,him,when,you,found,out,about,wade,or,did,your,mother,do,it,or,maybe,mr,o'hara,<END>
oh,dear,if,i,only,had,a,mother,to,do,it,<END>
i,just,don't,see,how,<END>
hush,<END>
said,scarlett,violently,<END>
hush,<END>
oh,scarlett,i'm,so,stupid,<END>
i'm,sorry,<END>
i,guess,all,happy,people,are,selfish,<END>
i,forgot,about,charlie,just,for,the,moment,<END>
hush,<END>
said,scarlett,again,fighting,to,control,her,face,and,make,her,emotions,quiet,<END>
never,never,must,melanie,see,or,suspect,how,she,felt,<END>
melanie,the,most,tactful,of,women,had,tears,in,her,eyes,at,her,own,cruelty,<END>
how,could,she,have,brought,back,to,scarlett,the,terrible,memories,of,wade,being,born,months,after,poor,charlie,was,dead,<END>
how,could,she,have,been,so,thoughtless,<END>
let,me,help,you,undress,dearest,she,said,humbly,<END>
and,i'll,rub,your,head,for,you,<END>
you,leave,me,alone,said,scarlett,her,face,like,stone,<END>
and,melanie,bursting,into,tears,of,self-condemnation,fled,the,room,leaving,scarlett,to,a,tearless,bed,with,wounded,pride,disillusionment,and,jealousy,for,bedfellows,<END>
she,thought,that,she,could,not,live,any,longer,in,the,same,house,with,the,woman,who,was,carrying,ashley's,child,thought,that,she,would,go,home,to,tara,home,where,she,belonged,<END>
she,did,not,see,how,she,could,ever,look,at,melanie,again,and,not,have,her,secret,read,in,her,face,<END>
and,she,arose,the,next,morning,with,the,fixed,intention,of,packing,her,trunk,immediately,after,breakfast,<END>
but,as,they,sat,at,the,table,scarlett,silent,and,gloomy,pitty,bewildered,and,melanie,miserable,a,telegram,came,<END>
it,was,to,melanie,from,ashley's,body,servant,mose,<END>
i,have,looked,everywhere,and,i,can't,find,him,<END>
must,i,come,home,<END>
no,one,knew,what,it,meant,but,the,eyes,of,the,three,women,went,to,one,another,wide,with,terror,and,scarlett,forgot,all,thoughts,of,going,home,<END>
without,finishing,their,breakfasts,they,drove,down,to,telegraph,ashley's,colonel,but,even,as,they,entered,the,office,there,was,a,telegram,from,him,<END>
regret,to,inform,you,major,wilkes,missing,since,scouting,expedition,three,days,ago,<END>
will,keep,you,informed,<END>
it,was,a,ghastly,trip,home,with,aunt,pitty,crying,into,her,handkerchief,melanie,sitting,erect,and,white,and,scarlett,slumped,stunned,in,the,corner,of,the,carriage,<END>
once,in,the,house,scarlett,stumbled,up,the,stairs,to,her,bedroom,and,clutching,her,rosary,from,the,table,dropped,to,her,knees,and,tried,to,pray,<END>
but,the,prayers,would,not,come,<END>
there,only,fell,on,her,an,abysmal,fear,a,certain,knowledge,that,god,had,turned,his,face,from,her,for,her,sin,<END>
she,had,loved,a,married,man,and,tried,to,take,him,from,his,wife,and,god,had,punished,her,by,killing,him,<END>
she,wanted,to,pray,but,she,could,not,raise,her,eyes,to,heaven,<END>
she,wanted,to,cry,but,the,tears,would,not,come,<END>
they,seemed,to,flood,her,chest,and,they,were,hot,tears,that,burned,under,her,bosom,but,they,would,not,flow,<END>
her,door,opened,and,melanie,entered,<END>
her,face,was,like,a,heart,cut,from,white,paper,framed,against,black,hair,and,her,eyes,were,wide,like,those,of,a,frightened,child,lost,in,the,dark,<END>
scarlett,she,said,putting,out,her,hands,<END>
you,must,forgive,me,for,what,i,said,yesterday,for,you're,all,i've,got,now,<END>
oh,scarlett,i,know,my,darling,is,dead,<END>
somehow,she,was,in,scarlett's,arms,her,small,breasts,heaving,with,sobs,and,somehow,they,were,lying,on,the,bed,holding,each,other,close,and,scarlett,was,crying,too,crying,with,her,face,pressed,close,against,melanie's,the,tears,of,one,wetting,the,cheeks,of,the,other,<END>
it,hurt,so,terribly,to,cry,but,not,so,much,as,not,being,able,to,cry,<END>
ashley,is,dead,dead,she,thought,and,i,have,killed,him,by,loving,him,<END>
fresh,sobs,broke,from,her,and,melanie,somehow,feeling,comfort,in,her,tears,tightened,her,arms,about,her,neck,<END>
at,least,she,whispered,at,least,i've,got,his,baby,<END>
and,i,thought,scarlett,too,stricken,now,for,anything,so,petty,as,jealousy,i've,got,nothing,nothing,nothing,except,the,look,on,his,face,when,he,told,me,good-by,<END>
the,first,reports,were,missing,believed,killed,and,so,they,appeared,on,the,casualty,list,<END>
melanie,telegraphed,colonel,sloan,a,dozen,times,and,finally,a,letter,arrived,full,of,sympathy,explaining,that,ashley,and,a,squad,had,ridden,out,on,a,scouting,expedition,and,had,not,returned,<END>
there,had,been,reports,of,a,slight,skirmish,within,the,yankee,lines,and,mose,frantic,with,grief,had,risked,his,own,life,to,search,for,ashley's,body,but,had,found,nothing,<END>
melanie,strangely,calm,now,telegraphed,him,money,and,instructions,to,come,home,<END>
when,missing,believed,captured,appeared,on,the,casualty,lists,joy,and,hope,reanimated,the,sad,household,<END>
melanie,could,hardly,be,dragged,away,from,the,telegraph,office,and,she,met,every,train,hoping,for,letters,<END>
she,was,sick,now,her,pregnancy,making,itself,felt,in,many,unpleasant,ways,but,she,refused,to,obey,dr,meade's,commands,and,stay,in,bed,<END>
a,feverish,energy,possessed,her,and,would,not,let,her,be,still,and,at,night,long,after,scarlett,had,gone,to,bed,she,could,hear,her,walking,the,floor,in,the,next,room,<END>
one,afternoon,she,came,home,from,town,driven,by,the,frightened,uncle,peter,and,supported,by,rhett,butler,<END>
she,had,fainted,at,the,telegraph,office,and,rhett,passing,by,and,observing,the,excitement,had,escorted,her,home,<END>
he,carried,her,up,the,stairs,to,her,bedroom,and,while,the,alarmed,household,fled,hither,and,yon,for,hot,bricks,blankets,and,whisky,he,propped,her,on,the,pillows,of,her,bed,<END>
mrs,wilkes,he,questioned,abruptly,you,are,going,to,have,a,baby,are,you,not,<END>
had,melanie,not,been,so,faint,so,sick,so,heartsore,she,would,have,collapsed,at,his,question,<END>
even,with,women,friends,she,was,embarrassed,by,any,mention,of,her,condition,while,visits,to,dr,meade,were,agonizing,experiences,<END>
and,for,a,man,especially,rhett,butler,to,ask,such,a,question,was,unthinkable,<END>
but,lying,weak,and,forlorn,in,the,bed,she,could,only,nod,<END>
after,she,had,nodded,it,did,not,seem,so,dreadful,for,he,looked,so,kind,and,so,concerned,<END>
then,you,must,take,better,care,of,yourself,<END>
all,this,running,about,and,worry,won't,help,you,and,may,harm,the,baby,<END>
if,you,will,permit,me,mrs,wilkes,i,will,use,what,influence,i,have,in,washington,to,learn,about,mr,wilkes',fate,<END>
if,he,is,a,prisoner,he,will,be,on,the,federal,lists,and,if,he,isn't,well,there's,nothing,worse,than,uncertainty,<END>
but,i,must,have,your,promise,<END>
take,care,of,yourself,or,before,god,i,won't,turn,a,hand,<END>
oh,you,are,so,kind,cried,melanie,<END>
how,can,people,say,such,dreadful,things,about,you,<END>
then,overcome,with,the,knowledge,of,her,tactlessness,and,also,with,horror,at,having,discussed,her,condition,with,a,man,she,began,to,cry,weakly,<END>
and,scarlett,flying,up,the,stairs,with,a,hot,brick,wrapped,in,flannel,found,rhett,patting,her,hand,<END>
he,was,as,good,as,his,word,<END>
they,never,knew,what,wires,he,pulled,<END>
they,feared,to,ask,knowing,it,might,involve,an,admission,of,his,too,close,affiliations,with,the,yankees,<END>
it,was,a,month,before,he,had,news,news,that,raised,them,to,the,heights,when,they,first,heard,it,but,later,created,a,gnawing,anxiety,in,their,hearts,<END>
ashley,was,not,dead,<END>
he,had,been,wounded,and,taken,prisoner,and,the,records,showed,that,he,was,at,rock,island,a,prison,camp,in,illinois,<END>
in,their,first,joy,they,could,think,of,nothing,except,that,he,was,alive,<END>
but,when,calmness,began,to,return,they,looked,at,one,another,and,said,rock,island,<END>
in,the,same,voice,they,would,have,said,in,hell,<END>
for,even,as,andersonville,was,a,name,that,stank,in,the,north,so,was,rock,island,one,to,bring,terror,to,the,heart,of,any,southerner,who,had,relatives,imprisoned,there,<END>
when,lincoln,refused,to,exchange,prisoners,believing,it,would,hasten,the,end,of,the,war,to,burden,the,confederacy,with,the,feeding,and,guarding,of,union,prisoners,there,were,thousands,of,bluecoats,at,andersonville,georgia,<END>
the,confederates,were,on,scant,rations,and,practically,without,drugs,or,bandages,for,their,own,sick,and,wounded,<END>
they,had,little,to,share,with,the,prisoners,<END>
they,fed,their,prisoners,on,what,the,soldiers,in,the,field,were,eating,fat,pork,and,dried,peas,and,on,this,diet,the,yankees,died,like,flies,sometimes,a,hundred,a,day,<END>
inflamed,by,the,reports,the,north,resorted,to,harsher,treatment,of,confederate,prisoners,and,at,no,place,were,conditions,worse,than,at,rock,island,<END>
food,was,scanty,one,blanket,for,three,men,and,the,ravages,of,smallpox,pneumonia,and,typhoid,gave,the,place,the,name,of,a,pest-house,<END>
three-fourths,of,all,the,men,sent,there,never,came,out,alive,<END>
and,ashley,was,in,that,horrible,place,<END>
ashley,was,alive,but,he,was,wounded,and,at,rock,island,and,the,snow,must,have,been,deep,in,illinois,when,he,was,taken,there,<END>
had,he,died,of,his,wound,since,rhett,had,learned,his,news,<END>
had,he,fallen,victim,to,smallpox,<END>

oh,captain,butler,isn't,there,some,way,can't,you,use,your,influence,and,have,him,exchanged,<END>
cried,melanie,<END>
mr,lincoln,the,merciful,and,just,who,cries,large,tears,over,mrs,bixby's,five,boys,hasn't,any,tears,to,shed,about,the,thousands,of,yankees,dying,at,andersonville,said,rhett,his,mouth,twisting,<END>
he,doesn't,care,if,they,all,die,<END>
the,order,is,out,<END>
no,exchanges,<END>
i,i,hadn't,told,you,before,mrs,wilkes,but,your,husband,had,a,chance,to,get,out,and,refused,it,<END>
oh,no,<END>
cried,melanie,in,disbelief,<END>
yes,indeed,<END>
the,yankees,are,recruiting,men,for,frontier,service,to,fight,the,indians,recruiting,them,from,among,confederate,prisoners,<END>
any,prisoner,who,will,take,the,oath,of,allegiance,and,enlist,for,indian,service,for,two,years,will,be,released,and,sent,west,<END>
mr,wilkes,refused,<END>
oh,how,could,he,<END>
cried,scarlett,<END>
why,didn't,he,take,the,oath,and,then,desert,and,come,home,as,soon,as,he,got,out,of,jail,<END>
melanie,turned,on,her,like,a,small,fury,<END>
how,can,you,even,suggest,that,he,would,do,such,a,thing,<END>
betray,his,own,confederacy,by,taking,that,vile,oath,and,then,betray,his,word,to,the,yankees,<END>
i,would,rather,know,he,was,dead,at,rock,island,than,hear,he,had,taken,that,oath,<END>
i'd,be,proud,of,him,if,he,died,in,prison,<END>
but,if,he,did,that,i,would,never,look,on,his,face,again,<END>
never,<END>
of,course,he,refused,<END>
when,scarlett,was,seeing,rhett,to,the,door,she,asked,indignantly,if,it,were,you,wouldn't,you,enlist,with,the,yankees,to,keep,from,dying,in,that,place,and,then,desert,<END>
of,course,said,rhett,his,teeth,showing,beneath,his,mustache,<END>
then,why,didn't,ashley,do,it,<END>
he's,a,gentleman,said,rhett,and,scarlett,wondered,how,it,was,possible,to,convey,such,cynicism,and,contempt,in,that,one,honorable,word,<END>
part,three,<END>
chapter,xvii,<END>
may,of,1864,came,a,hot,dry,may,that,wilted,the,flowers,in,the,buds,and,the,yankees,under,general,sherman,were,in,georgia,again,above,dalton,one,hundred,miles,northwest,of,atlanta,<END>
rumor,had,it,that,there,would,be,heavy,fighting,up,there,near,the,boundary,between,georgia,and,tennessee,<END>
the,yankees,were,massing,for,an,attack,on,the,western,and,atlantic,railroad,the,line,which,connected,atlanta,with,tennessee,and,the,west,the,same,line,over,which,the,southern,troops,had,been,rushed,last,fall,to,win,the,victory,at,chickamauga,<END>
but,for,the,most,part,atlanta,was,not,disturbed,by,the,prospect,of,fighting,near,dalton,<END>
the,place,where,the,yankees,were,concentrating,was,only,a,few,miles,southeast,of,the,battle,field,of,chickamauga,<END>
they,had,been,driven,back,once,when,they,had,tried,to,break,through,the,mountain,passes,of,that,region,and,they,would,be,driven,back,again,<END>
atlanta,and,all,of,georgia,knew,that,the,state,was,far,too,important,to,the,confederacy,for,general,joe,johnston,to,let,the,yankees,remain,inside,the,state's,borders,for,long,<END>
old,joe,and,his,army,would,not,let,even,one,yankee,get,south,of,dalton,for,too,much,depended,on,the,undisturbed,functioning,of,georgia,<END>
the,unravaged,state,was,a,vast,granary,machine,shop,and,storehouse,for,the,confederacy,<END>
it,manufactured,much,of,the,powder,and,arms,used,by,the,army,and,most,of,the,cotton,and,woolen,goods,<END>
lying,between,atlanta,and,dalton,was,the,city,of,rome,with,its,cannon,foundry,and,its,other,industries,and,etowah,and,allatoona,with,the,largest,ironworks,south,of,richmond,<END>
and,in,atlanta,were,not,only,the,factories,for,making,pistols,and,saddles,tents,and,ammunition,but,also,the,most,extensive,rolling,mills,in,the,south,the,shops,of,the,principal,railroads,and,the,enormous,hospitals,<END>
and,in,atlanta,was,the,junction,of,the,four,railroads,on,which,the,very,life,of,the,confederacy,depended,<END>
so,no,one,worried,particularly,<END>
after,all,dalton,was,a,long,way,off,up,near,the,tennessee,line,<END>
there,had,been,fighting,in,tennessee,for,three,years,and,people,were,accustomed,to,the,thought,of,that,state,as,a,far-away,battle,field,almost,as,far,away,as,virginia,or,the,mississippi,river,<END>
moreover,old,joe,and,his,men,were,between,the,yankees,and,atlanta,and,everyone,knew,that,next,to,general,lee,himself,there,was,no,greater,general,than,johnston,now,that,stonewall,jackson,was,dead,<END>
dr,meade,summed,up,the,civilian,point,of,view,on,the,matter,one,warm,may,evening,on,the,veranda,of,aunt,pitty's,house,when,he,said,that,atlanta,had,nothing,to,fear,for,general,johnston,was,standing,in,the,mountains,like,an,iron,rampart,<END>

they,could,not,break,the,gray,lines,by,direct,assault,and,so,under,cover,of,night,they,marched,through,the,mountain,passes,in,a,semicircle,hoping,to,come,upon,johnston's,rear,and,cut,the,railroad,behind,him,at,resaca,fifteen,miles,below,dalton,<END>
with,those,precious,twin,lines,of,iron,in,danger,the,confederates,left,their,desperately,defended,rifle,pits,and,under,the,starlight,made,a,forced,march,to,resaca,by,the,short,direct,road,<END>

you,are,like,everyone,else,screaming,'off,with,his,head',because,he,can't,do,the,impossible,<END>
he,was,jesus,the,savior,at,dalton,and,now,he's,judas,the,betrayer,at,kennesaw,mountain,all,in,six,weeks,<END>

so,hyah,us,is,<END>
what,does,it,all,mean,captain,randall,<END>
oh,it's,quite,simple,<END>
we,have,to,strengthen,the,fortifications,of,atlanta,with,more,miles,of,rifle,pits,and,the,general,can't,spare,any,men,from,the,front,to,do,it,<END>
so,we've,been,impressing,the,strongest,bucks,in,the,countryside,for,the,work,<END>
but,<END>
a,cold,little,fear,was,beginning,to,throb,in,scarlett's,breast,<END>
more,miles,of,rifle,pits,<END>
why,should,they,need,more,<END>
within,the,last,year,a,series,of,huge,earth,redoubts,with,battery,emplacements,had,been,built,all,around,atlanta,one,mile,from,the,center,of,town,<END>
these,great,earth-works,were,connected,with,rifle,pits,and,they,ran,mile,after,mile,completely,encircling,the,city,<END>
more,rifle,pits,<END>
but,why,should,we,be,fortified,any,more,than,we,are,already,fortified,<END>
we,won't,need,what,we've,got,<END>
surely,the,general,won't,let,<END>
our,present,fortifications,are,only,a,mile,from,town,said,captain,randall,shortly,<END>
and,that's,too,close,for,comfort,or,safety,<END>
these,new,ones,are,going,to,be,farther,away,<END>
you,see,another,retreat,may,bring,our,men,into,atlanta,<END>
immediately,he,regretted,his,last,remark,as,her,eyes,widened,with,fear,<END>
but,of,course,there,won't,be,another,retreat,he,added,hastily,<END>
the,lines,around,kennesaw,mountain,are,impregnable,<END>
the,batteries,are,planted,all,up,the,mountain,sides,and,they,command,the,roads,and,the,yankees,can't,possibly,get,by,<END>
but,scarlett,saw,him,drop,his,eyes,before,the,lazy,penetrating,look,rhett,gave,him,and,she,was,frightened,<END>
she,remembered,rhett's,remark,when,the,yankees,push,him,out,of,the,mountains,and,onto,the,flatter,land,he'll,be,butchered,<END>
oh,captain,do,you,think,<END>
why,of,course,not,<END>
don't,fret,your,mind,one,minute,<END>
old,joe,just,believes,in,taking,precautions,<END>
that's,the,only,reason,we're,digging,more,entrenchments,<END>
but,i,must,be,going,now,<END>
it's,been,pleasant,talking,to,you,<END>
say,good-by,to,your,mistress,boys,and,let's,get,going,<END>
good-by,boys,<END>
now,if,you,get,sick,or,hurt,or,in,trouble,let,me,know,<END>
i,live,right,down,peachtree,street,down,there,in,almost,the,last,house,at,the,end,of,town,<END>
wait,a,minute,she,fumbled,in,her,reticule,<END>
oh,dear,i,haven't,a,cent,<END>
rhett,give,me,a,few,shinplasters,<END>
here,big,sam,buy,some,tobacco,for,yourself,and,the,boys,<END>
and,be,good,and,do,what,captain,randall,tells,you,<END>
the,straggling,line,re-formed,the,dust,arose,again,in,a,red,cloud,as,they,moved,off,and,big,sam,started,up,the,singing,again,<END>

rhett,captain,randall,was,lying,to,me,just,like,all,the,men,do,trying,to,keep,the,truth,from,us,women,for,fear,we'll,faint,<END>
or,was,he,lying,<END>
oh,rhett,if,there's,no,danger,why,are,they,digging,these,new,breastworks,<END>
is,the,army,so,short,of,men,they've,got,to,use,darkies,<END>
rhett,clucked,to,the,mare,<END>
the,army,is,damned,short,of,men,<END>
why,else,would,the,home,guard,be,called,out,<END>
and,as,for,the,entrenchments,well,fortifications,are,supposed,to,be,of,some,value,in,case,of,a,siege,<END>
the,general,is,preparing,to,make,his,final,stand,here,<END>
a,siege,<END>
oh,turn,the,horse,around,<END>
i'm,going,home,back,home,to,tara,right,away,<END>
what,ails,you,<END>
a,siege,<END>
name,of,god,a,siege,<END>
i've,heard,about,sieges,<END>
pa,was,in,one,or,maybe,it,was,his,pa,and,pa,told,me,<END>
what,siege,<END>
the,siege,at,drogheda,when,cromwell,had,the,irish,and,they,didn't,have,anything,to,eat,and,pa,said,they,starved,and,died,in,the,streets,and,finally,they,ate,all,the,cats,and,rats,and,even,things,like,cockroaches,<END>
and,he,said,they,ate,each,other,too,before,they,surrendered,though,i,never,did,know,whether,to,believe,that,or,not,<END>
and,when,cromwell,took,the,town,all,the,women,were,a,siege,<END>
mother,of,god,<END>
you,are,the,most,barbarously,ignorant,young,person,i,ever,saw,<END>
drogheda,was,in,sixteen,hundred,and,something,and,mr,o'hara,couldn't,possibly,have,been,alive,then,<END>
besides,sherman,isn't,cromwell,<END>
no,but,he's,worse,<END>
they,say,<END>
and,as,for,the,exotic,viands,the,irish,ate,at,the,siege,personally,i'd,as,soon,eat,a,nice,juicy,rat,as,some,of,the,victuals,they've,been,serving,me,recently,at,the,hotel,<END>
i,think,i,shall,have,to,go,back,to,richmond,<END>
they,have,good,food,there,if,you,have,the,money,to,pay,for,it,<END>
his,eyes,mocked,the,fear,in,her,face,<END>
annoyed,that,she,had,shown,her,trepidation,she,cried,i,don't,see,why,you've,stayed,here,this,long,<END>
all,you,think,about,is,being,comfortable,and,eating,and,and,things,like,that,<END>
i,know,no,more,pleasant,way,to,pass,the,time,than,in,eating,and,er,things,like,that,he,said,<END>
and,as,for,why,i,stay,here,well,i've,read,a,good,deal,about,sieges,beleaguered,cities,and,the,like,but,i've,never,seen,one,<END>
so,i,think,i'll,stay,here,and,watch,<END>
i,won't,get,hurt,because,i'm,a,noncombatant,and,besides,i,want,the,experience,<END>
never,pass,up,new,experiences,scarlett,<END>
they,enrich,the,mind,<END>
my,mind's,rich,enough,<END>
perhaps,you,know,best,about,that,but,i,should,say,but,that,would,be,ungallant,<END>
and,perhaps,i'm,staying,here,to,rescue,you,when,the,siege,does,come,<END>
i've,never,rescued,a,maiden,in,distress,<END>
that,would,be,a,new,experience,too,<END>
she,knew,he,was,teasing,her,but,she,sensed,a,seriousness,behind,his,words,<END>
she,tossed,her,head,<END>
i,won't,need,you,to,rescue,me,<END>
i,can,take,care,of,myself,thank,you,<END>
don't,say,that,scarlett,<END>
think,of,it,if,you,like,but,never,never,say,it,to,a,man,<END>
that's,the,trouble,with,yankee,girls,<END>
they'd,be,most,charming,if,they,weren't,always,telling,you,that,they,can,take,care,of,themselves,thank,you,<END>
generally,they,are,telling,the,truth,god,help,them,<END>
and,so,men,let,them,take,care,of,themselves,<END>
how,you,do,run,on,she,said,coldly,for,there,was,no,insult,worse,than,being,likened,to,a,yankee,girl,<END>
i,believe,you're,lying,about,a,siege,<END>
you,know,the,yankees,will,never,get,to,atlanta,<END>
i'll,bet,you,they,will,be,here,within,the,month,<END>
i'll,bet,you,a,box,of,bonbons,against,his,dark,eyes,wandered,to,her,lips,<END>
against,a,kiss,<END>
for,a,last,brief,moment,fear,of,a,yankee,invasion,clutched,her,heart,but,at,the,word,kiss,she,forgot,about,it,<END>
this,was,familiar,ground,and,far,more,interesting,than,military,operations,<END>
with,difficulty,she,restrained,a,smile,of,glee,<END>
since,the,day,when,he,gave,her,the,green,bonnet,rhett,had,made,no,advances,which,could,in,any,way,be,construed,as,those,of,a,lover,<END>
he,could,never,be,inveigled,into,personal,conversations,try,though,she,might,but,now,with,no,angling,on,her,part,he,was,talking,about,kissing,<END>
i,don't,care,for,such,personal,conversation,she,said,coolly,and,managed,a,frown,<END>
besides,i'd,just,as,soon,kiss,a,pig,<END>
there's,no,accounting,for,tastes,and,i've,always,heard,the,irish,were,partial,to,pigs,kept,them,under,their,beds,in,fact,<END>
but,scarlett,you,need,kissing,badly,<END>
that's,what's,wrong,with,you,<END>
all,your,beaux,have,respected,you,too,much,though,god,knows,why,or,they,have,been,too,afraid,of,you,to,really,do,right,by,you,<END>
the,result,is,that,you,are,unendurably,uppity,<END>
you,should,be,kissed,and,by,someone,who,knows,how,<END>
the,conversation,was,not,going,the,way,she,wanted,it,<END>
it,never,did,when,she,was,with,him,<END>
always,it,was,a,duel,in,which,she,was,worsted,<END>
and,i,suppose,you,think,you,are,the,proper,person,<END>
she,asked,with,sarcasm,holding,her,temper,in,check,with,difficulty,<END>
oh,yes,if,i,cared,to,take,the,trouble,he,said,carelessly,<END>
they,say,i,kiss,very,well,<END>
oh,she,began,indignant,at,the,slight,to,her,charms,<END>
why,you,<END>
but,her,eyes,fell,in,sudden,confusion,<END>
he,was,smiling,but,in,the,dark,depths,of,his,eyes,a,tiny,light,flickered,for,a,brief,moment,like,a,small,raw,flame,<END>
of,course,you've,probably,wondered,why,i,never,tried,to,follow,up,that,chaste,peck,i,gave,you,the,day,i,brought,you,that,bonnet,<END>
i,have,never,<END>
then,you,aren't,a,nice,girl,scarlett,and,i'm,sorry,to,hear,it,<END>
all,really,nice,girls,wonder,when,men,don't,try,to,kiss,them,<END>
they,know,they,shouldn't,want,them,to,and,they,know,they,must,act,insulted,if,they,do,but,just,the,same,they,wish,the,men,would,try,<END>
well,my,dear,take,heart,<END>
some,day,i,will,kiss,you,and,you,will,like,it,<END>
but,not,now,so,i,beg,you,not,to,be,too,impatient,<END>
she,knew,he,was,teasing,but,as,always,his,teasing,maddened,her,<END>
there,was,always,too,much,truth,in,the,things,he,said,<END>
well,this,finished,him,<END>
if,ever,ever,he,should,be,so,ill,bred,as,to,try,to,take,any,liberties,with,her,she,would,show,him,<END>
will,you,kindly,turn,the,horse,around,captain,butler,<END>
i,wish,to,go,back,to,the,hospital,<END>
do,you,indeed,my,ministering,angel,<END>
then,lice,and,slops,are,preferable,to,my,conversation,<END>
well,far,be,it,from,me,to,keep,a,pair,of,willing,hands,from,laboring,for,our,glorious,cause,<END>
he,turned,the,horse's,head,and,they,started,back,toward,five,points,<END>
as,to,why,i,have,made,no,further,advances,he,pursued,blandly,as,though,she,had,not,signified,that,the,conversation,was,at,an,end,i'm,waiting,for,you,to,grow,up,a,little,more,<END>
you,see,it,wouldn't,be,much,fun,for,me,to,kiss,you,now,and,i'm,quite,selfish,about,my,pleasures,<END>
i,never,fancied,kissing,children,<END>
he,smothered,a,grin,as,from,the,corner,of,his,eye,he,saw,her,bosom,heave,with,silent,wrath,<END>
and,then,too,he,continued,softly,i,was,waiting,for,the,memory,of,the,estimable,ashley,wilkes,to,fade,<END>
at,the,mention,of,ashley's,name,sudden,pain,went,through,her,sudden,hot,tears,stung,her,lids,<END>
fade,<END>
the,memory,of,ashley,would,never,fade,not,if,he,were,dead,a,thousand,years,<END>
she,thought,of,ashley,wounded,dying,in,a,far-off,yankee,prison,with,no,blankets,over,him,with,no,one,who,loved,him,to,hold,his,hand,and,she,was,filled,with,hate,for,the,well-fed,man,who,sat,beside,her,jeers,just,beneath,the,surface,of,his,drawling,voice,<END>
she,was,too,angry,to,speak,and,they,rode,along,in,silence,for,some,while,<END>
i,understand,practically,everything,about,you,and,ashley,now,rhett,resumed,<END>
i,began,with,your,inelegant,scene,at,twelve,oaks,and,since,then,i've,picked,up,many,things,by,keeping,my,eyes,open,<END>
what,things,<END>
oh,that,you,still,cherish,a,romantic,schoolgirl,passion,for,him,which,he,reciprocates,as,well,as,his,honorable,nature,will,permit,him,<END>
and,that,mrs,wilkes,knows,nothing,and,that,between,the,two,of,you,you've,done,her,a,pretty,trick,<END>
i,understand,practically,everything,except,one,thing,that,piques,my,curiosity,<END>
did,the,honorable,ashley,ever,jeopardize,his,immortal,soul,by,kissing,you,<END>
a,stony,silence,and,an,averted,head,were,his,answers,<END>
ah,well,so,he,did,kiss,you,<END>
i,suppose,it,was,when,he,was,here,on,furlough,<END>
and,now,that,he's,probably,dead,you,are,cherishing,it,to,your,heart,<END>
but,i'm,sure,you'll,get,over,it,and,when,you've,forgotten,his,kiss,i'll,<END>
she,turned,in,fury,<END>
you,go,to,halifax,she,said,tensely,her,green,eyes,slits,of,rage,<END>
and,let,me,out,of,this,carriage,before,i,jump,over,the,wheels,<END>
and,i,don't,ever,want,to,speak,to,you,again,<END>
he,stopped,the,carriage,but,before,he,could,alight,and,assist,her,she,sprang,down,<END>
her,hoop,caught,on,the,wheel,and,for,a,moment,the,crowd,at,five,points,had,a,flashing,view,of,petticoats,and,pantalets,<END>
then,rhett,leaned,over,and,swiftly,released,it,<END>
she,flounced,off,without,a,word,without,even,a,backward,look,and,he,laughed,softly,and,clicked,to,the,horse,<END>
chapter,xviii,<END>
for,the,first,time,since,the,war,began,atlanta,could,hear,the,sound,of,battle,<END>
in,the,early,morning,hours,before,the,noises,of,the,town,awoke,the,cannon,at,kennesaw,mountain,could,be,heard,faintly,far,away,a,low,dim,booming,that,might,have,passed,for,summer,thunder,<END>
occasionally,it,was,loud,enough,to,be,heard,even,above,the,rattle,of,traffic,at,noon,<END>
people,tried,not,to,listen,to,it,tried,to,talk,to,laugh,to,carry,on,their,business,just,as,though,the,yankees,were,not,there,twenty-two,miles,away,but,always,ears,were,strained,for,the,sound,<END>
the,town,wore,a,preoccupied,look,for,no,matter,what,occupied,their,hands,all,were,listening,listening,their,hearts,leaping,suddenly,a,hundred,times,a,day,<END>

nerves,which,had,been,stretched,tighter,and,tighter,each,day,of,the,retreat,began,to,reach,the,breaking,point,<END>
no,one,spoke,of,fears,<END>

with,the,far-off,rumbling,of,cannon,in,their,ears,the,state,militia,joe,brown's,pets,and,the,home,guard,marched,out,of,atlanta,to,defend,the,bridges,and,ferries,of,the,chattahoochee,river,at,johnston's,back,<END>
it,was,a,gray,overcast,day,and,as,they,marched,through,five,points,and,out,the,marietta,road,a,fine,rain,began,to,fall,<END>

scarlett,and,maybelle,merriwether,picard,had,been,given,permission,to,leave,the,hospital,and,watch,the,men,go,out,because,uncle,henry,hamilton,and,grandpa,merriwether,were,in,the,home,guard,and,they,stood,with,mrs,meade,pressed,in,the,crowd,tiptoeing,to,get,a,better,view,<END>
scarlett,though,filled,with,the,universal,southern,desire,to,believe,only,the,pleasantest,and,most,reassuring,things,about,the,progress,of,the,fighting,felt,cold,as,she,watched,the,motley,ranks,go,by,<END>

then,as,the,last,cannon,and,limber,chest,came,groaning,and,splashing,up,she,saw,him,slender,erect,his,long,silver,hair,wet,upon,his,neck,riding,easily,upon,a,little,strawberry,mare,that,picked,her,way,as,daintily,through,the,mud,holes,as,a,lady,in,a,satin,dress,<END>

when,he,saw,her,standing,in,the,mud,mr,wilkes,drew,rein,with,a,smile,of,pleasure,and,dismounting,came,toward,her,<END>
i,had,hoped,to,see,you,scarlett,<END>

why,must,you,go,<END>
ah,so,you,think,i'm,too,old,<END>
he,smiled,and,it,was,ashley's,smile,in,an,older,face,<END>
perhaps,i,am,too,old,to,march,but,not,to,ride,and,shoot,<END>
and,mrs,tarleton,so,kindly,lent,me,nellie,so,i,am,well,mounted,<END>
i,hope,nothing,happens,to,nellie,for,if,something,should,happen,to,her,i,could,never,go,home,and,face,mrs,tarleton,<END>
nellie,was,the,last,horse,she,had,left,<END>

your,mother,and,father,and,the,girls,are,well,and,they,sent,you,their,love,<END>
your,father,nearly,came,up,with,us,today,<END>

not,pa,<END>
he,isn't,going,to,the,war,is,he,<END>
no,but,he,was,<END>
of,course,he,can't,walk,far,with,his,stiff,knee,but,he,was,all,for,riding,away,with,us,<END>
your,mother,agreed,providing,he,was,able,to,jump,the,pasture,fence,for,she,said,there,would,be,a,lot,of,rough,riding,to,be,done,in,the,army,<END>
your,father,thought,that,easy,but,would,you,believe,it,<END>
when,his,horse,came,to,the,fence,he,stopped,dead,and,over,his,head,went,your,father,<END>
it's,a,wonder,it,didn't,break,his,neck,<END>
you,know,how,obstinate,he,is,<END>
he,got,right,up,and,tried,it,again,<END>
well,scarlett,he,came,off,three,times,before,mrs,o'hara,and,pork,assisted,him,to,bed,<END>
he,was,in,a,taking,about,it,swearing,that,your,mother,had,'spoken,a,wee,word,in,the,beast's,ear,',<END>
he,just,isn't,up,to,active,service,scarlett,<END>
you,need,have,no,shame,about,it,<END>
after,all,someone,must,stay,home,and,raise,crops,for,the,army,<END>
scarlett,had,no,shame,at,all,only,an,active,feeling,of,relief,<END>
i've,sent,india,and,honey,to,macon,to,stay,with,the,burrs,and,mr,o'hara,is,looking,after,twelve,oaks,as,well,as,tara,<END>
i,must,go,my,dear,<END>
let,me,kiss,your,pretty,face,<END>
scarlett,turned,up,her,lips,and,there,was,a,choking,pain,in,her,throat,<END>
she,was,so,fond,of,mr,wilkes,<END>
once,long,ago,she,had,hoped,to,be,his,daughter-in-law,<END>
and,you,must,deliver,this,kiss,to,pittypat,and,this,to,melanie,he,said,kissing,her,lightly,two,more,times,<END>
and,how,is,melanie,<END>
she,is,well,<END>
ah,<END>
his,eyes,looked,at,her,but,through,her,past,her,as,ashley's,had,done,remote,gray,eyes,looking,on,another,world,<END>
i,should,have,liked,to,see,my,first,grandchild,<END>
good-by,my,dear,<END>
he,swung,onto,nellie,and,cantered,off,his,hat,in,his,hand,his,silver,hair,bare,to,the,rain,<END>
scarlett,had,rejoined,maybelle,and,mrs,meade,before,the,import,of,his,last,words,broke,upon,her,<END>
then,in,superstitious,terror,she,crossed,herself,and,tried,to,say,a,prayer,<END>
he,had,spoken,of,death,just,as,ashley,had,done,and,now,ashley,no,one,should,ever,speak,of,death,<END>
it,was,tempting,providence,to,mention,death,<END>
as,the,three,women,started,silently,back,to,the,hospital,in,the,rain,scarlett,was,praying,not,him,too,god,<END>
not,him,and,ashley,too,<END>
the,retreat,from,dalton,to,kennesaw,mountain,had,taken,from,early,may,to,mid-june,and,as,the,hot,rainy,days,of,june,passed,and,sherman,failed,to,dislodge,the,confederates,from,the,steep,slippery,slopes,hope,again,raised,its,head,<END>
everyone,grew,more,cheerful,and,spoke,more,kindly,of,general,johnston,<END>
as,wet,june,days,passed,into,a,wetter,july,and,the,confederates,fighting,desperately,around,the,entrenched,heights,still,held,sherman,at,bay,a,wild,gaiety,took,hold,of,atlanta,<END>
hope,went,to,their,heads,like,champagne,<END>
hurrah,<END>
hurrah,<END>
we're,holding,them,<END>
an,epidemic,of,parties,and,dances,broke,out,<END>
whenever,groups,of,men,from,the,fighting,were,in,town,for,the,night,dinners,were,given,for,them,and,afterwards,there,was,dancing,and,the,girls,outnumbering,the,men,ten,to,one,made,much,of,them,and,fought,to,dance,with,them,<END>
atlanta,was,crowded,with,visitors,refugees,families,of,wounded,men,in,the,hospitals,wives,and,mothers,of,soldiers,fighting,at,the,mountain,who,wished,to,be,near,them,in,case,of,wounds,<END>
in,addition,bevies,of,belles,from,the,country,districts,where,all,remaining,men,were,under,sixteen,or,over,sixty,descended,upon,the,town,<END>
aunt,pitty,disapproved,highly,of,these,last,for,she,felt,they,had,come,to,atlanta,for,no,reason,at,all,except,to,catch,husbands,and,the,shamelessness,of,it,made,her,wonder,what,the,world,was,coming,to,<END>
scarlett,disapproved,too,<END>
she,did,not,care,for,the,eager,competition,furnished,by,the,sixteen-year-olds,whose,fresh,cheeks,and,bright,smiles,made,one,forget,their,twice-turned,frocks,and,patched,shoes,<END>
her,own,clothes,were,prettier,and,newer,than,most,thanks,to,the,material,rhett,butler,had,brought,her,on,the,last,boat,he,ran,in,but,after,all,she,was,nineteen,and,getting,along,and,men,had,a,way,of,chasing,silly,young,things,<END>
a,widow,with,a,child,was,at,a,disadvantage,with,these,pretty,minxes,she,thought,<END>
but,in,these,exciting,days,her,widowhood,and,her,motherhood,weighed,less,heavily,upon,her,than,ever,before,<END>
between,hospital,duties,in,the,day,time,and,parties,at,night,she,hardly,ever,saw,wade,<END>
sometimes,she,actually,forgot,for,long,stretches,that,she,had,a,child,<END>
in,the,warm,wet,summer,nights,atlanta's,homes,stood,open,to,the,soldiers,the,town's,defenders,<END>
the,big,houses,from,washington,street,to,peachtree,street,blazed,with,lights,as,the,muddy,fighters,in,from,the,rifle,pits,were,entertained,and,the,sound,of,banjo,and,fiddle,and,the,scrape,of,dancing,feet,and,light,laughter,carried,far,on,the,night,air,<END>
groups,hung,over,pianos,and,voices,sang,lustily,the,sad,words,of,your,letter,came,but,came,too,late,while,ragged,gallants,looked,meaningly,at,girls,who,laughed,from,behind,turkey-tail,fans,begging,them,not,to,wait,until,it,was,too,late,<END>
none,of,the,girls,waited,if,they,could,help,it,<END>
with,the,tide,of,hysterical,gaiety,and,excitement,flooding,the,city,they,rushed,into,matrimony,<END>
there,were,so,many,marriages,that,month,while,johnston,was,holding,the,enemy,at,kennesaw,mountain,marriages,with,the,bride,turned,out,in,blushing,happiness,and,the,hastily,borrowed,finery,of,a,dozen,friends,and,the,groom,with,saber,banging,at,patched,knees,<END>
so,much,excitement,so,many,parties,so,many,thrills,<END>
hurrah,<END>
johnston,is,holding,the,yanks,twenty-two,miles,away,<END>
yes,the,lines,around,kennesaw,mountain,were,impregnable,<END>
after,twenty-five,days,of,fighting,even,general,sherman,was,convinced,of,this,for,his,losses,were,enormous,<END>
instead,of,continuing,the,direct,assault,he,swung,his,army,in,a,wide,circle,again,and,tried,to,come,between,the,confederates,and,atlanta,<END>
again,the,strategy,worked,<END>
johnston,was,forced,to,abandon,the,heights,he,had,held,so,well,in,order,to,protect,his,rear,<END>
he,had,lost,a,third,of,his,men,in,that,fight,and,the,remainder,slogged,tiredly,through,the,rain,across,the,country,toward,the,chattahoochee,river,<END>
the,confederates,could,expect,no,more,reinforcements,whereas,the,railroad,which,the,yankees,now,held,from,tennessee,south,to,the,battle,line,brought,sherman,fresh,troops,and,supplies,daily,<END>
so,the,gray,lines,went,back,through,the,muddy,fields,back,toward,atlanta,<END>
with,the,loss,of,the,supposedly,unconquerable,position,a,fresh,wave,of,terror,swept,the,town,<END>
for,twenty-five,wild,happy,days,everyone,had,assured,everyone,else,that,this,could,not,possibly,happen,<END>
and,now,it,had,happened,<END>
but,surely,the,general,would,hold,the,yankees,on,the,opposite,bank,of,the,river,<END>
though,god,knows,the,river,was,close,enough,only,seven,miles,away,<END>
but,sherman,flanked,them,again,crossing,the,stream,above,them,and,the,weary,gray,files,were,forced,to,hurry,across,the,yellow,water,and,throw,themselves,again,between,the,invaders,and,atlanta,<END>
they,dug,in,hastily,in,shallow,pits,to,the,north,of,the,town,in,the,valley,of,peachtree,creek,<END>
atlanta,was,in,agony,and,panic,<END>
fight,and,fall,back,<END>
fight,and,fall,back,<END>
and,every,retreat,was,bringing,the,yankees,closer,to,the,town,<END>
peachtree,creek,was,only,five,miles,away,<END>
what,was,the,general,thinking,about,<END>
the,cries,of,give,us,a,man,who,will,stand,and,fight,<END>
penetrated,even,to,richmond,<END>
richmond,knew,that,if,atlanta,was,lost,the,war,was,lost,and,after,the,army,had,crossed,the,chattahoochee,general,johnston,was,removed,from,command,<END>
general,hood,one,of,his,corps,commanders,took,over,the,army,and,the,town,breathed,a,little,easier,<END>
hood,wouldn't,retreat,<END>
not,that,tall,kentuckian,with,his,flowing,beard,and,flashing,eye,<END>
he,had,the,reputation,of,a,bulldog,<END>
he'd,drive,the,yankees,back,from,the,creek,yes,back,across,the,river,and,on,up,the,road,every,step,of,the,way,back,to,dalton,<END>
but,the,army,cried,give,us,back,old,joe,<END>
for,they,had,been,with,old,joe,all,the,weary,miles,from,dalton,and,they,knew,as,the,civilians,could,not,know,the,odds,that,had,opposed,them,<END>
sherman,did,not,wait,for,hood,to,get,himself,in,readiness,to,attack,<END>
on,the,day,after,the,change,in,command,the,yankee,general,struck,swiftly,at,the,little,town,of,decatur,six,miles,beyond,atlanta,captured,it,and,cut,the,railroad,there,<END>
this,was,the,railroad,connecting,atlanta,with,augusta,with,charleston,and,wilmington,and,with,virginia,<END>
sherman,had,dealt,the,confederacy,a,crippling,blow,<END>
the,time,had,come,for,action,<END>
atlanta,screamed,for,action,<END>
then,on,a,july,afternoon,of,steaming,heat,atlanta,had,its,wish,<END>
general,hood,did,more,than,stand,and,fight,<END>
he,assaulted,the,yankees,fiercely,at,peachtree,creek,hurling,his,men,from,their,rifle,pits,against,the,blue,lines,where,sherman's,men,outnumbered,him,more,than,two,to,one,<END>
frightened,praying,that,hood's,attack,would,drive,the,yankees,back,everyone,listened,to,the,sound,of,booming,cannon,and,the,crackling,of,thousands,of,rifles,which,though,five,miles,away,from,the,center,of,town,were,so,loud,as,to,seem,almost,in,the,next,block,<END>
they,could,hear,the,rumblings,of,the,batteries,see,the,smoke,which,rolled,like,low-hanging,clouds,above,the,trees,but,for,hours,no,one,knew,how,the,battle,was,going,<END>
by,late,afternoon,the,first,news,came,but,it,was,uncertain,contradictory,frightening,brought,as,it,was,by,men,wounded,in,the,early,hours,of,the,battle,<END>
these,men,began,straggling,in,singly,and,in,groups,the,less,seriously,wounded,supporting,those,who,limped,and,staggered,<END>
soon,a,steady,stream,of,them,was,established,making,their,painful,way,into,town,toward,the,hospitals,their,faces,black,as,negroes',from,powder,stains,dust,and,sweat,their,wounds,unbandaged,blood,drying,flies,swarming,about,them,<END>
aunt,pitty's,was,one,of,the,first,houses,which,the,wounded,reached,as,they,struggled,in,from,the,north,of,the,town,and,one,after,another,they,tottered,to,the,gate,sank,down,on,the,green,lawn,and,croaked,<END>
water,<END>
all,that,burning,afternoon,aunt,pitty,and,her,family,black,and,white,stood,in,the,sun,with,buckets,of,water,and,bandages,ladling,drinks,binding,wounds,until,the,bandages,gave,out,and,even,the,torn,sheets,and,towels,were,exhausted,<END>
aunt,pitty,completely,forgot,that,the,sight,of,blood,always,made,her,faint,and,she,worked,until,her,little,feet,in,their,too,small,shoes,swelled,and,would,no,longer,support,her,<END>
even,melanie,now,great,with,child,forgot,her,modesty,and,worked,feverishly,side,by,side,with,prissy,cookie,and,scarlett,her,face,as,tense,as,any,of,the,wounded,<END>
when,at,last,she,fainted,there,was,no,place,to,lay,her,except,on,the,kitchen,table,as,every,bed,chair,and,sofa,in,the,house,was,filled,with,wounded,<END>
forgotten,in,the,tumult,little,wade,crouched,behind,the,banisters,on,the,front,porch,peering,out,onto,the,lawn,like,a,caged,frightened,rabbit,his,eyes,wide,with,terror,sucking,his,thumb,and,hiccoughing,<END>
once,scarlett,saw,him,and,cried,sharply,go,play,in,the,back,yard,wade,hampton,<END>
but,he,was,too,terrified,too,fascinated,by,the,mad,scene,before,him,to,obey,<END>
the,lawn,was,covered,with,prostrate,men,too,tired,to,walk,farther,too,weak,from,wounds,to,move,<END>

mrs,meade,and,mrs,merriwether,sent,their,carriages,and,they,too,drove,off,springs,sagging,beneath,the,weight,of,the,wounded,<END>
later,in,the,long,hot,summer,twilight,the,ambulances,came,rumbling,down,the,road,from,the,battle,field,and,commissary,wagons,covered,with,muddy,canvas,<END>
then,farm,wagons,ox,carts,and,even,private,carriages,commandeered,by,the,medical,corps,<END>
they,passed,aunt,pitty's,house,jolting,over,the,bumpy,road,packed,with,wounded,and,dying,men,dripping,blood,into,the,red,dust,<END>
at,the,sight,of,the,women,with,buckets,and,dippers,the,conveyances,halted,and,the,chorus,went,up,in,cries,in,whispers,<END>

scarlett,held,wobbling,heads,that,parched,lips,might,drink,poured,buckets,of,water,over,dusty,feverish,bodies,and,into,open,wounds,that,the,men,might,enjoy,a,brief,moment's,relief,<END>

her,lavender,calico,dress,so,freshly,clean,and,starched,that,morning,was,streaked,with,blood,dirt,and,sweat,<END>
this,then,was,what,ashley,had,meant,when,he,wrote,that,war,was,not,glory,but,dirt,and,misery,<END>
fatigue,gave,an,unreal,nightmarish,cast,to,the,whole,scene,<END>
it,couldn't,be,real,or,it,was,real,then,the,world,had,gone,mad,<END>

oh,ashley,<END>
ashley,<END>
you,must,be,dead,dead,these,many,months,<END>
and,now,your,promise,reaches,out,and,clutches,me,<END>
well,she,said,shortly,i,did,promise,him,that,and,i,don't,go,back,on,my,promises,<END>

your,mother,is,so,sweet,<END>

dr,meade,who,had,arrived,out,of,breath,expecting,to,find,melanie,in,premature,labor,at,least,judging,by,aunt,pitty's,alarmed,summoning,was,indignant,and,said,as,much,<END>
and,upon,learning,the,cause,of,the,upset,he,settled,the,matter,with,words,that,left,no,room,for,argument,<END>
it's,out,of,the,question,for,you,to,go,to,macon,miss,melly,<END>
i,won't,answer,for,you,if,you,move,<END>
the,trains,are,crowded,and,uncertain,and,the,passengers,are,liable,to,be,put,off,in,the,woods,at,any,time,if,the,trains,are,needed,for,the,wounded,or,troops,and,supplies,<END>
in,your,condition,<END>
but,if,i,went,to,tara,with,scarlett,<END>
i,tell,you,i,won't,have,you,moved,<END>
the,train,to,tara,is,the,train,to,macon,and,the,same,conditions,prevail,<END>
moreover,no,one,knows,just,where,the,yankees,are,now,but,they,are,all,over,everywhere,<END>
your,train,might,even,be,captured,<END>
and,even,if,you,reached,jonesboro,safely,there'd,be,a,five-mile,ride,over,a,rough,road,before,you,ever,reached,tara,<END>
it's,no,trip,for,a,woman,in,a,delicate,condition,<END>
besides,there's,not,a,doctor,in,the,county,since,old,dr,fontaine,joined,the,army,<END>
but,there,are,midwives,<END>
i,said,a,doctor,he,answered,brusquely,and,his,eyes,unconsciously,went,over,her,tiny,frame,<END>
i,won't,have,you,moved,<END>
it,might,be,dangerous,<END>
you,don't,want,to,have,the,baby,on,the,train,or,in,a,buggy,do,you,<END>
this,medical,frankness,reduced,the,ladies,to,embarrassed,blushes,and,silence,<END>
you've,got,to,stay,right,here,where,i,can,watch,you,and,you,must,stay,in,bed,<END>
no,running,up,and,down,stairs,to,cellars,<END>
no,not,even,if,shells,come,right,in,the,window,<END>
after,all,there's,not,so,much,danger,here,<END>
we'll,have,the,yankees,beaten,back,in,no,time,<END>
now,miss,pitty,you,go,right,on,to,macon,and,leave,the,young,ladies,here,<END>
unchaperoned,<END>
she,cried,aghast,<END>
they,are,matrons,said,the,doctor,testily,<END>

they,won't,be,receiving,any,male,company,anyway,with,miss,melly,in,her,condition,<END>
good,heavens,miss,pitty,<END>
this,is,war,time,<END>
we,can't,think,of,the,proprieties,now,<END>
we,must,think,of,miss,melly,<END>
he,stamped,out,of,the,room,and,waited,on,the,front,porch,until,scarlett,joined,him,<END>
i,shall,talk,frankly,to,you,miss,scarlett,he,began,jerking,at,his,gray,beard,<END>
you,seem,to,be,a,young,woman,of,common,sense,so,spare,me,your,blushes,<END>
i,do,not,want,to,hear,any,further,talk,about,miss,melly,being,moved,<END>
i,doubt,if,she,could,stand,the,trip,<END>
she,is,going,to,have,a,difficult,time,even,in,the,best,of,circumstances,very,narrow,in,the,hips,as,you,know,and,probably,will,need,forceps,for,her,delivery,so,i,don't,want,any,ignorant,darky,midwife,meddling,with,her,<END>
women,like,her,should,never,have,children,but,anyway,you,pack,miss,pitty's,trunk,and,send,her,to,macon,<END>
she's,so,scared,she'll,upset,miss,melly,and,that,won't,do,any,good,<END>
and,now,miss,he,fixed,her,with,a,piercing,glance,i,don't,want,to,hear,about,you,going,home,either,<END>
you,stay,with,miss,melly,till,the,baby,comes,<END>
not,afraid,are,you,<END>
oh,no,<END>
lied,scarlett,stoutly,<END>
that's,a,brave,girl,<END>
mrs,meade,will,give,you,whatever,chaperonage,you,need,and,i'll,send,over,old,betsy,to,cook,for,you,if,miss,pitty,wants,to,take,her,servants,with,her,<END>
it,won't,be,for,long,<END>
the,baby,ought,to,be,here,in,another,five,weeks,but,you,never,can,tell,with,first,babies,and,all,this,shelling,going,on,<END>
it,may,come,any,day,<END>
so,aunt,pittypat,went,to,macon,in,floods,of,tears,taking,uncle,peter,and,cookie,with,her,<END>
the,carriage,and,horse,she,donated,to,the,hospital,in,a,burst,of,patriotism,which,she,immediately,regretted,and,that,brought,on,more,tears,<END>
and,scarlett,and,melanie,were,left,alone,with,wade,and,prissy,in,a,house,that,was,much,quieter,even,though,the,cannonading,continued,<END>
chapter,xix,<END>
in,those,first,days,of,the,siege,when,the,yankees,crashed,here,and,there,against,the,defenses,of,the,city,scarlett,was,so,frightened,by,the,bursting,shells,she,could,only,cower,helplessly,her,hands,over,her,ears,expecting,every,moment,to,be,blown,into,eternity,<END>
when,she,heard,the,whistling,screams,that,heralded,their,approach,she,rushed,to,melanie's,room,and,flung,herself,on,the,bed,beside,her,and,the,two,clutched,each,other,screaming,oh,<END>
oh,<END>
as,they,buried,their,heads,in,the,pillows,<END>
prissy,and,wade,scurried,for,the,cellar,and,crouched,in,the,cobwebbed,darkness,prissy,squalling,at,the,top,of,her,voice,and,wade,sobbing,and,hiccoughing,<END>
suffocating,under,feather,pillows,while,death,screamed,overhead,scarlett,silently,cursed,melanie,for,keeping,her,from,the,safer,regions,below,stairs,<END>
but,the,doctor,had,forbidden,melanie,to,walk,and,scarlett,had,to,stay,with,her,<END>
added,to,her,terror,of,being,blown,to,pieces,was,her,equally,active,terror,that,melanie's,baby,might,arrive,at,any,moment,<END>
sweat,broke,out,on,scarlett,with,clammy,dampness,whenever,this,thought,entered,her,mind,<END>
what,would,she,do,if,the,baby,started,coming,<END>
she,knew,she'd,rather,let,melanie,die,than,go,out,on,the,streets,to,hunt,for,the,doctor,when,the,shells,were,falling,like,april,rain,<END>
and,she,knew,prissy,could,be,beaten,to,death,before,she,would,venture,forth,<END>
what,would,she,do,if,the,baby,came,<END>
these,matters,she,discussed,with,prissy,in,whispers,one,evening,as,they,prepared,melanie's,supper,tray,and,prissy,surprisingly,enough,calmed,her,fears,<END>
miss,scarlett,effen,we,kain,git,de,doctah,w'en,miss,melly's,time,come,doan,you,bodder,<END>

ain',mah,ma,a,midwife,<END>
ain',she,raise,me,ter,be,a,midwife,too,<END>
jes',you,leave,it,ter,me,<END>
scarlett,breathed,more,easily,knowing,that,experienced,hands,were,near,but,she,nevertheless,yearned,to,have,the,ordeal,over,and,done,with,<END>
mad,to,be,away,from,exploding,shells,desperate,to,get,home,to,the,quiet,of,tara,she,prayed,every,night,that,the,baby,would,arrive,the,next,day,so,she,would,be,released,from,her,promise,and,could,leave,atlanta,<END>
tara,seemed,so,safe,so,far,away,from,all,this,misery,<END>
scarlett,longed,for,home,and,her,mother,as,she,had,never,longed,for,anything,in,all,her,life,<END>
if,she,were,just,near,ellen,she,wouldn't,be,afraid,no,matter,what,happened,<END>
every,night,after,a,day,of,screeching,ear-splitting,shells,she,went,to,bed,determined,to,tell,melanie,the,next,morning,that,she,could,not,stand,atlanta,another,day,that,she,would,have,to,go,home,and,melanie,would,have,to,go,to,mrs,meade's,<END>
but,as,she,lay,on,her,pillow,there,always,rose,the,memory,of,ashley's,face,as,it,had,looked,when,she,last,saw,him,drawn,as,with,an,inner,pain,but,with,a,little,smile,on,his,lips,you'll,take,care,of,melanie,won't,you,<END>
you're,so,strong,<END>
promise,me,<END>
and,she,had,promised,<END>
somewhere,ashley,lay,dead,<END>
wherever,he,was,he,was,watching,her,holding,her,to,that,promise,<END>
living,or,dead,she,could,not,fail,him,no,matter,what,the,cost,<END>
so,she,remained,day,after,day,<END>
in,response,to,ellen's,letters,pleading,with,her,to,come,home,she,wrote,minimizing,the,dangers,of,the,siege,explaining,melanie's,predicament,and,promising,to,come,as,soon,as,the,baby,was,born,<END>
ellen,sensitive,to,the,bonds,of,kin,be,they,blood,or,marriage,wrote,back,reluctantly,agreeing,that,she,must,stay,but,demanding,wade,and,prissy,be,sent,home,immediately,<END>
this,suggestion,met,with,the,complete,approval,of,prissy,who,was,now,reduced,to,teeth-,chattering,idiocy,at,every,unexpected,sound,<END>
she,spent,so,much,time,crouching,in,the,cellar,that,the,girls,would,have,fared,badly,but,for,mrs,meade's,stolid,old,betsy,<END>
scarlett,was,as,anxious,as,her,mother,to,have,wade,out,of,atlanta,not,only,for,the,child's,safety,but,because,his,constant,fear,irritated,her,<END>
wade,was,terrified,to,speechlessness,by,the,shelling,and,even,when,lulls,came,he,clung,to,scarlett's,skirts,too,terrified,to,cry,<END>
he,was,afraid,to,go,to,bed,at,night,afraid,of,the,dark,afraid,to,sleep,lest,the,yankees,should,come,and,get,him,and,the,sound,of,his,soft,nervous,whimpering,in,the,night,grated,unendurably,on,her,nerves,<END>
secretly,she,was,just,as,frightened,as,he,was,but,it,angered,her,to,be,reminded,of,it,every,minute,by,his,tense,drawn,face,<END>
yes,tara,was,the,place,for,wade,<END>
prissy,should,take,him,there,and,return,immediately,to,be,present,when,the,baby,came,<END>
but,before,scarlett,could,start,the,two,on,their,homeward,journey,news,came,that,the,yankees,had,swung,to,the,south,and,were,skirmishing,along,the,railroad,between,atlanta,and,jonesboro,<END>
suppose,the,yankees,should,capture,the,train,on,which,wade,and,prissy,were,riding,scarlett,and,melanie,turned,pale,at,the,thought,for,everyone,knew,that,yankee,atrocities,on,helpless,children,were,even,more,dreadful,than,on,women,<END>
so,she,feared,to,send,him,home,and,he,remained,in,atlanta,a,frightened,silent,little,ghost,pattering,about,desperately,after,his,mother,fearing,to,have,her,skirt,out,of,his,hand,for,even,a,minute,<END>
the,siege,went,on,through,the,hot,days,of,july,thundering,days,following,nights,of,sullen,ominous,stillness,and,the,town,began,to,adjust,itself,<END>
it,was,as,though,the,worst,having,happened,they,had,nothing,more,to,fear,<END>
they,had,feared,a,siege,and,now,they,had,a,siege,and,after,all,it,wasn't,so,bad,<END>
life,could,and,did,go,on,almost,as,usual,<END>
they,knew,they,were,sitting,on,a,volcano,but,until,that,volcano,erupted,there,was,nothing,they,could,do,<END>
so,why,worry,now,<END>
and,probably,it,wouldn't,erupt,anyway,<END>
just,look,how,general,hood,is,holding,the,yankees,out,of,the,city,<END>
and,see,how,the,cavalry,is,holding,the,railroad,to,macon,<END>
sherman,will,never,take,it,<END>
but,for,all,their,apparent,insouciance,in,the,face,of,falling,shells,and,shorter,rations,for,all,their,ignoring,the,yankees,barely,half,a,mile,away,and,for,all,their,boundless,confidence,in,the,ragged,line,of,gray,men,in,the,rifle,pits,there,pulsed,just,below,the,skin,of,atlanta,a,wild,uncertainty,over,what,the,next,day,would,bring,<END>
suspense,worry,sorrow,hunger,and,the,torment,of,rising,falling,rising,hope,was,wearing,that,skin,thin,<END>
gradually,scarlett,drew,courage,from,the,brave,faces,of,her,friends,and,from,the,merciful,adjustment,which,nature,makes,when,what,cannot,be,cured,must,be,endured,<END>
to,be,sure,she,still,jumped,at,the,sound,of,explosions,but,she,did,not,run,screaming,to,burrow,her,head,under,melanie's,pillow,<END>
she,could,now,gulp,and,say,weakly,that,was,close,wasn't,it,<END>
she,was,less,frightened,also,because,life,had,taken,on,the,quality,of,a,dream,a,dream,too,terrible,to,be,real,<END>
it,wasn't,possible,that,she,scarlett,o'hara,should,be,in,such,a,predicament,with,the,danger,of,death,about,her,every,hour,every,minute,<END>

it,was,unreal,grotesquely,unreal,that,morning,skies,which,dawned,so,tenderly,blue,could,be,profaned,with,cannon,smoke,that,hung,over,the,town,like,low,thunder,clouds,that,warm,noontides,filled,with,the,piercing,sweetness,of,massed,honeysuckle,and,climbing,roses,could,be,so,fearful,as,shells,screamed,into,the,streets,bursting,like,the,crack,of,doom,throwing,iron,splinters,hundreds,of,yards,blowing,people,and,animals,to,bits,<END>
quiet,drowsy,afternoon,siestas,had,ceased,to,be,for,though,the,clamor,of,battle,might,lull,from,time,to,time,peachtree,street,was,alive,and,noisy,at,all,hours,cannon,and,ambulances,rumbling,by,wounded,stumbling,in,from,the,rifle,pits,regiments,hurrying,past,at,double-quick,ordered,from,the,ditches,on,one,side,of,town,to,the,defense,of,some,hard-pressed,earthworks,on,the,other,and,couriers,dashing,headlong,down,the,street,toward,headquarters,as,though,the,fate,of,the,confederacy,hung,on,them,<END>
the,hot,nights,brought,a,measure,of,quiet,but,it,was,a,sinister,quiet,<END>
when,the,night,was,still,it,was,too,still,as,though,the,tree,frogs,katydids,and,sleepy,mockingbirds,were,too,frightened,to,raise,their,voices,in,the,usual,summer-night,chorus,<END>
now,and,again,the,quiet,was,broken,sharply,by,the,crack-cracking,of,musket,fire,in,the,last,line,of,defenses,<END>
often,in,the,late,night,hours,when,the,lamps,were,out,and,melanie,asleep,and,deathly,silence,pressed,over,the,town,scarlett,lying,awake,heard,the,latch,of,the,front,gate,click,and,soft,urgent,tappings,on,the,front,door,<END>
always,faceless,soldiers,stood,on,the,dark,porch,and,from,the,darkness,many,different,voices,spoke,to,her,<END>
sometimes,a,cultured,voice,came,from,the,shadows,madam,my,abject,apologies,for,disturbing,you,but,could,i,have,water,for,myself,and,my,horse,<END>
sometimes,it,was,the,hard,burring,of,a,mountain,voice,sometimes,the,odd,nasals,of,the,flat,wiregrass,country,to,the,far,south,occasionally,the,lulling,drawl,of,the,coast,that,caught,at,her,heart,reminding,her,of,ellen's,voice,<END>

i,saw,the,roses,and,smelled,the,honeysuckle,and,it,was,so,much,like,home,that,i,was,emboldened,<END>
no,these,nights,were,not,real,<END>
they,were,a,nightmare,and,the,men,were,part,of,that,nightmare,men,without,bodies,or,faces,only,tired,voices,speaking,to,her,from,the,warm,dark,<END>
draw,water,serve,food,lay,pillows,on,the,front,porch,bind,wounds,hold,the,dirty,heads,of,the,dying,<END>
no,this,could,not,be,happening,to,her,<END>
once,late,in,july,it,was,uncle,henry,hamilton,who,came,tapping,in,the,night,<END>
uncle,henry,was,minus,his,umbrella,and,carpetbag,now,and,his,fat,stomach,as,well,<END>
the,skin,of,his,pink,fat,face,hung,down,in,loose,folds,like,the,dewlaps,of,a,bulldog,and,his,long,white,hair,was,indescribably,dirty,<END>
he,was,almost,barefoot,crawling,with,lice,and,he,was,hungry,but,his,irascible,spirit,was,unimpaired,<END>
despite,his,remark,it's,a,foolish,war,when,old,fools,like,me,are,out,toting,guns,the,girls,received,the,impression,that,uncle,henry,was,enjoying,himself,<END>
he,was,needed,like,the,young,men,and,he,was,doing,a,young,man's,work,<END>
moreover,he,could,keep,up,with,the,young,men,which,was,more,than,grandpa,merriwether,could,do,he,told,them,gleefully,<END>
grandpa's,lumbago,was,troubling,him,greatly,and,the,captain,wanted,to,discharge,him,<END>
but,grandpa,wouldn't,go,home,<END>
he,said,frankly,that,he,preferred,the,captain's,swearing,and,bullying,to,his,daughter-in-law's,coddling,and,her,incessant,demands,that,he,give,up,chewing,tobacco,and,launder,his,beard,every,day,<END>
uncle,henry's,visit,was,brief,for,he,had,only,a,four-hour,furlough,and,he,needed,half,of,it,for,the,long,walk,in,from,the,breastworks,and,back,<END>
girls,i'm,not,going,to,see,you,all,for,a,while,he,announced,as,he,sat,in,melanie's,bedroom,luxuriously,wriggling,his,blistered,feet,in,the,tub,of,cold,water,scarlett,had,set,before,him,<END>
our,company,is,going,out,in,the,morning,<END>
where,<END>
questioned,melanie,frightened,clutching,his,arm,<END>
don't,put,your,hand,on,me,said,uncle,henry,irritably,<END>
i'm,crawling,with,lice,<END>
war,would,be,a,picnic,if,it,wasn't,for,lice,and,dysentery,<END>
where'm,i,going,<END>
well,i,haven't,been,told,but,i've,got,a,good,idea,<END>
we're,marching,south,toward,jonesboro,in,the,morning,unless,i'm,greatly,in,error,<END>
oh,why,toward,jonesboro,<END>
because,there's,going,to,be,big,fighting,there,missy,<END>
the,yankees,are,going,to,take,the,railroad,if,they,possibly,can,<END>
and,if,they,do,take,it,it's,good-by,atlanta,<END>
oh,uncle,henry,do,you,think,they,will,<END>
shucks,girls,<END>
no,<END>
how,can,they,when,i'm,there,<END>
uncle,henry,grinned,at,their,frightened,faces,and,then,becoming,serious,again,it's,going,to,be,a,hard,fight,girls,<END>
we've,got,to,win,it,<END>
you,know,of,course,that,the,yankees,have,got,all,the,railroads,except,the,one,to,macon,but,that,isn't,all,they've,got,<END>
maybe,you,girls,didn't,know,it,but,they've,got,every,road,too,every,wagon,lane,and,bridle,path,except,the,mcdonough,road,<END>
atlanta's,in,a,bag,and,the,strings,of,the,bag,are,at,jonesboro,<END>
and,if,the,yankees,can,take,the,railroad,there,they,can,pull,up,the,strings,and,have,us,just,like,a,possum,in,a,poke,<END>
so,we,don't,aim,to,let,them,get,that,railroad,<END>
i,may,be,gone,a,while,girls,<END>
i,just,came,in,to,tell,you,all,good-by,and,to,make,sure,scarlett,was,still,with,you,melly,<END>
of,course,she's,with,me,said,melanie,fondly,<END>
don't,you,worry,about,us,uncle,henry,and,do,take,care,of,yourself,<END>
uncle,henry,wiped,his,wet,feet,on,the,rag,rug,and,groaned,as,he,drew,on,his,tattered,shoes,<END>
i,got,to,be,going,he,said,<END>
i've,got,five,miles,to,walk,<END>
scarlett,you,fix,me,up,some,kind,of,lunch,to,take,<END>
anything,you've,got,<END>
after,he,had,kissed,melanie,good-by,he,went,down,to,the,kitchen,where,scarlett,was,wrapping,a,corn,pone,and,some,apples,in,a,napkin,<END>
uncle,henry,is,it,is,it,really,so,serious,<END>
serious,<END>
god'lmighty,yes,<END>
don't,be,a,goose,<END>
we're,in,the,last,ditch,<END>
do,you,think,they'll,get,to,tara,<END>
why,began,uncle,henry,irritated,at,the,feminine,mind,which,thought,only,of,personal,things,when,broad,issues,were,involved,<END>
then,seeing,her,frightened,woebegone,face,he,softened,<END>
of,course,they,won't,<END>
tara's,five,miles,from,the,railroad,and,it's,the,railroad,the,yankees,want,<END>
you've,got,no,more,sense,than,a,june,bug,missy,<END>
he,broke,off,abruptly,<END>
i,didn't,walk,all,this,way,here,tonight,just,to,tell,you,all,good-by,<END>
i,came,to,bring,melly,some,bad,news,but,when,i,got,up,to,it,i,just,couldn't,tell,her,<END>
so,i'm,going,to,leave,it,to,you,to,do,<END>
ashley,isn't,you,haven't,heard,anything,that,he's,dead,<END>
now,how,would,i,be,hearing,about,ashley,when,i've,been,standing,in,rifle,pits,up,to,the,seat,of,my,pants,in,mud,<END>
the,old,gentleman,asked,testily,<END>
no,<END>
it's,about,his,father,<END>
john,wilkes,is,dead,<END>
scarlett,sat,down,suddenly,the,half-wrapped,lunch,in,her,hand,<END>
i,came,to,tell,melly,but,i,couldn't,<END>
you,must,do,it,<END>
and,give,her,these,<END>
he,hauled,from,his,pockets,a,heavy,gold,watch,with,dangling,seals,a,small,miniature,of,the,long,dead,mrs,wilkes,and,a,pair,of,massive,cuff,buttons,<END>
at,the,sight,of,the,watch,which,she,had,seen,in,john,wilkes',hands,a,thousand,times,the,full,realization,came,over,scarlett,that,ashley's,father,was,really,dead,<END>
and,she,was,too,stunned,to,cry,or,to,speak,<END>
uncle,henry,fidgeted,coughed,and,did,not,look,at,her,lest,he,catch,sight,of,a,tear,that,would,upset,him,<END>
he,was,a,brave,man,scarlett,<END>
tell,melly,that,<END>
tell,her,to,write,it,to,his,girls,<END>
and,a,good,soldier,for,all,his,years,<END>
a,shell,got,him,<END>
came,right,down,on,him,and,his,horse,<END>
tore,the,horse's,i,shot,the,horse,myself,poor,creature,<END>
a,fine,little,mare,she,was,<END>
you'd,better,write,mrs,tarleton,about,that,too,<END>
she,set,a,store,on,that,mare,<END>
wrap,up,my,lunch,child,<END>
i,must,be,going,<END>
there,dear,don't,take,it,so,hard,<END>
what,better,way,can,an,old,man,die,than,doing,a,young,man's,work,<END>
oh,he,shouldn't,have,died,<END>
he,shouldn't,have,ever,gone,to,the,war,<END>
he,should,have,lived,and,seen,his,grandchild,grow,up,and,died,peacefully,in,bed,<END>
oh,why,did,he,go,<END>
he,didn't,believe,in,secession,and,he,hated,the,war,and,<END>
plenty,of,us,think,that,way,but,what,of,it,<END>
uncle,henry,blew,his,nose,grumpily,<END>
do,you,think,i,enjoy,letting,yankee,riflemen,use,me,for,a,target,at,my,age,<END>
but,there's,no,other,choice,for,a,gentleman,these,days,<END>
kiss,me,good-by,child,and,don't,worry,about,me,<END>
i'll,come,through,this,war,safely,<END>
scarlett,kissed,him,and,heard,him,go,down,the,steps,into,the,dark,heard,the,latch,click,on,the,front,gate,<END>
she,stood,for,a,minute,looking,at,the,keepsakes,in,her,hand,<END>
and,then,she,went,up,the,stairs,to,tell,melanie,<END>
at,the,end,of,july,came,the,unwelcome,news,predicted,by,uncle,henry,that,the,yankees,had,swung,around,again,toward,jonesboro,<END>
they,had,cut,the,railroad,four,miles,below,the,town,but,they,had,been,beaten,off,by,the,confederate,cavalry,and,the,engineering,corps,sweating,in,the,broiling,sun,had,repaired,the,line,<END>
scarlett,was,frantic,with,anxiety,<END>
for,three,days,she,waited,fear,growing,in,her,heart,<END>
then,a,reassuring,letter,came,from,gerald,<END>
the,enemy,had,not,reached,tara,<END>
they,had,heard,the,sound,of,the,fight,but,they,had,seen,no,yankees,<END>
gerald's,letter,was,so,full,of,brag,and,bluster,as,to,how,the,yankees,had,been,driven,from,the,railroad,that,one,would,have,thought,he,personally,had,accomplished,the,feat,single,handed,<END>
he,wrote,for,three,pages,about,the,gallantry,of,the,troops,and,then,at,the,end,of,his,letter,mentioned,briefly,that,carreen,was,ill,the,typhoid,mrs,o'hara,said,it,was,<END>
she,was,not,very,ill,and,scarlett,was,not,to,worry,about,her,but,on,no,condition,must,she,come,home,now,even,if,the,railroad,should,become,safe,<END>
mrs,o'hara,was,very,glad,now,that,scarlett,and,wade,had,not,come,home,when,the,siege,began,<END>
mrs,o'hara,said,scarlett,must,go,to,church,and,say,some,rosaries,for,carreen's,recovery,<END>
scarlett's,conscience,smote,her,at,this,last,for,it,had,been,months,since,she,had,been,to,church,<END>
once,she,would,have,thought,this,omission,a,mortal,sin,but,somehow,staying,away,from,church,did,not,seem,so,sinful,now,as,it,formerly,had,<END>
but,she,obeyed,her,mother,and,going,to,her,room,gabbled,a,hasty,rosary,<END>
when,she,rose,from,her,knees,she,did,not,feel,as,comforted,as,she,had,formerly,felt,after,prayer,<END>
for,some,time,she,had,felt,that,god,was,not,watching,out,for,her,the,confederates,or,the,south,in,spite,of,the,millions,of,prayers,ascending,to,him,daily,<END>
that,night,she,sat,on,the,front,porch,with,gerald's,letter,in,her,bosom,where,she,could,touch,it,occasionally,and,bring,tara,and,ellen,closer,to,her,<END>
the,lamp,in,the,parlor,window,threw,odd,golden,shadows,onto,the,dark,vine-shrouded,porch,and,the,matted,tangle,of,yellow,climbing,roses,and,honeysuckle,made,a,wall,of,mingled,fragrance,about,her,<END>
the,night,was,utterly,still,<END>
not,even,the,crack,of,a,rifle,had,sounded,since,sunset,and,the,world,seemed,far,away,<END>
scarlett,rocked,back,and,forth,lonely,miserable,since,reading,the,news,from,tara,wishing,that,someone,anyone,even,mrs,merriwether,were,with,her,<END>
but,mrs,merriwether,was,on,night,duty,at,the,hospital,mrs,meade,was,at,home,making,a,feast,for,phil,who,was,in,from,the,front,lines,and,melanie,was,asleep,<END>
there,was,not,even,the,hope,of,a,chance,caller,<END>
visitors,had,fallen,off,to,nothing,this,last,week,for,every,man,who,could,walk,was,in,the,rifle,pits,or,chasing,the,yankees,about,the,countryside,near,jonesboro,<END>
it,was,not,often,that,she,was,alone,like,this,and,she,did,not,like,it,<END>
when,she,was,alone,she,had,to,think,and,these,days,thoughts,were,not,so,pleasant,<END>
like,everyone,else,she,had,fallen,into,the,habit,of,thinking,of,the,past,the,dead,<END>
tonight,when,atlanta,was,so,quiet,she,could,close,her,eyes,and,imagine,she,was,back,in,the,rural,stillness,of,tara,and,that,life,was,unchanged,unchanging,<END>
but,she,knew,that,life,in,the,county,would,never,be,the,same,again,<END>
she,thought,of,the,four,tarletons,the,red-haired,twins,and,tom,and,boyd,and,a,passionate,sadness,caught,at,her,throat,<END>
why,either,stu,or,brent,might,have,been,her,husband,<END>
but,now,when,the,war,was,over,and,she,went,back,to,tara,to,live,she,would,never,again,hear,their,wild,halloos,as,they,dashed,up,the,avenue,of,cedars,<END>
and,raiford,calvert,who,danced,so,divinely,would,never,again,choose,her,to,be,his,partner,<END>
and,the,munroe,boys,and,little,joe,fontaine,and,<END>
oh,ashley,<END>
she,sobbed,dropping,her,head,into,her,hands,<END>
i'll,never,get,used,to,you,being,gone,<END>
she,heard,the,front,gate,click,and,she,hastily,raised,her,head,and,dashed,her,hand,across,her,wet,eyes,<END>
she,rose,and,saw,it,was,rhett,butler,coming,up,the,walk,carrying,his,wide,panama,hat,in,his,hand,<END>
she,had,not,seen,him,since,the,day,when,she,had,alighted,from,his,carriage,so,precipitously,at,five,points,<END>
on,that,occasion,she,had,expressed,the,desire,never,to,lay,eyes,on,him,again,<END>
but,she,was,so,glad,now,to,have,someone,to,talk,to,someone,to,divert,her,thoughts,from,ashley,that,she,hastily,put,the,memory,from,her,mind,<END>
evidently,he,had,forgotten,the,contretemps,or,pretended,to,have,forgotten,it,for,he,settled,himself,on,the,top,step,at,her,feet,without,mention,of,their,late,difference,<END>
so,you,didn't,refugee,to,macon,<END>
i,heard,that,miss,pitty,had,retreated,and,of,course,i,thought,you,had,gone,too,<END>
so,when,i,saw,your,light,i,came,here,to,investigate,<END>
why,did,you,stay,<END>
to,keep,melanie,company,<END>
you,see,she,well,she,can't,refugee,just,now,<END>
thunderation,he,said,and,in,the,lamplight,she,saw,that,he,was,frowning,<END>
you,don't,mean,to,tell,me,mrs,wilkes,is,still,here,<END>
i,never,heard,of,such,idiocy,<END>
it's,quite,dangerous,for,her,in,her,condition,<END>
scarlett,was,silent,embarrassed,for,melanie's,condition,was,not,a,subject,she,could,discuss,with,a,man,<END>
she,was,embarrassed,too,that,rhett,should,know,it,was,dangerous,for,melanie,<END>
such,knowledge,sat,ill,upon,a,bachelor,<END>
it's,quite,ungallant,of,you,not,to,think,that,i,might,get,hurt,too,she,said,tartly,<END>
his,eyes,flickered,with,amusement,<END>
i'd,back,you,against,the,yankees,any,day,<END>
i'm,not,sure,that,that's,a,compliment,she,said,uncertainly,<END>
it,isn't,he,answered,<END>
when,will,you,stop,looking,for,compliments,in,men's,lightest,utterances,<END>
when,i'm,on,my,deathbed,she,replied,and,smiled,thinking,that,there,would,always,be,men,to,compliment,her,even,if,rhett,never,did,<END>
vanity,vanity,he,said,<END>
at,least,you,are,frank,about,it,<END>
he,opened,his,cigar,case,extracted,a,black,cigar,and,held,it,to,his,nose,for,a,moment,<END>
a,match,flared,he,leaned,back,against,a,post,and,clasping,his,hands,about,his,knees,smoked,a,while,in,silence,<END>
scarlett,resumed,her,rocking,and,the,still,darkness,of,the,warm,night,closed,about,them,<END>
the,mockingbird,which,nested,in,the,tangle,of,roses,and,honeysuckle,roused,from,slumber,and,gave,one,timid,liquid,note,<END>
then,as,if,thinking,better,of,the,matter,it,was,silent,again,<END>
from,the,shadow,of,the,porch,rhett,suddenly,laughed,a,low,soft,laugh,<END>
so,you,stayed,with,mrs,wilkes,<END>
this,is,the,strangest,situation,i,ever,encountered,<END>
i,see,nothing,strange,about,it,she,answered,uncomfortably,immediately,on,the,alert,<END>
no,<END>
but,then,you,lack,the,impersonal,viewpoint,<END>
my,impression,has,been,for,some,time,past,that,you,could,hardly,endure,mrs,wilkes,<END>
you,think,her,silly,and,stupid,and,her,patriotic,notions,bore,you,<END>
you,seldom,pass,by,the,opportunity,to,slip,in,some,belittling,remark,about,her,so,naturally,it,seems,strange,to,me,that,you,should,elect,to,do,the,unselfish,thing,and,stay,here,with,her,during,this,shelling,<END>
now,just,why,did,you,do,it,<END>
because,she's,charlie's,sister,and,like,a,sister,to,me,answered,scarlett,with,as,much,dignity,as,possible,though,her,cheeks,were,growing,hot,<END>
you,mean,because,she's,ashley's,wilkes',widow,<END>
scarlett,rose,quickly,struggling,with,her,anger,<END>
i,was,almost,on,the,point,of,forgiving,you,for,your,former,boorish,conduct,but,now,i,shan't,do,it,<END>
i,wouldn't,have,ever,let,you,come,upon,this,porch,at,all,if,i,hadn't,been,feeling,so,blue,and,<END>
sit,down,and,smooth,your,ruffled,fur,he,said,and,his,voice,changed,<END>
he,reached,up,and,taking,her,hand,pulled,her,back,into,her,chair,<END>
why,are,you,blue,<END>
oh,i,had,a,letter,from,tara,today,<END>
the,yankees,are,close,to,home,and,my,little,sister,is,ill,with,typhoid,and,and,so,now,even,if,i,could,go,home,like,i,want,to,mother,wouldn't,let,me,for,fear,i'd,catch,it,too,<END>
oh,dear,and,i,do,so,want,to,go,home,<END>
well,don't,cry,about,it,he,said,but,his,voice,was,kinder,<END>
you,are,much,safer,here,in,atlanta,even,if,the,yankees,do,come,than,you'd,be,at,tara,<END>
the,yankees,won't,hurt,you,and,typhoid,would,<END>
the,yankees,wouldn't,hurt,me,<END>
how,can,you,say,such,a,lie,<END>
my,dear,girl,the,yankees,aren't,fiends,<END>
they,haven't,horns,and,hoofs,as,you,seem,to,think,<END>
they,are,pretty,much,like,southerners,except,with,worse,manners,of,course,and,terrible,accents,<END>
why,the,yankees,would,<END>
rape,you,<END>
i,think,not,<END>
though,of,course,they'd,want,to,<END>
if,you,are,going,to,talk,vilely,i,shall,go,into,the,house,she,cried,grateful,that,the,shadows,hid,her,crimson,face,<END>
be,frank,<END>
wasn't,that,what,you,were,thinking,<END>
oh,certainly,not,<END>
oh,but,it,was,<END>
no,use,getting,mad,at,me,for,reading,your,thoughts,<END>
that's,what,all,our,delicately,nurtured,and,pure-minded,southern,ladies,think,<END>
they,have,it,on,their,minds,constantly,<END>

scarlett,gulped,in,silence,remembering,that,wherever,two,or,more,matrons,were,gathered,together,in,these,trying,days,they,whispered,of,such,happenings,always,in,virginia,or,tennessee,or,lousiana,never,close,to,home,<END>
the,yankees,raped,women,and,ran,bayonets,through,children's,stomachs,and,burned,houses,over,the,heads,of,old,people,<END>
everyone,knew,these,things,were,true,even,if,they,didn't,shout,them,on,the,street,corners,<END>

and,not,talk,about,them,<END>
and,it,wasn't,any,laughing,matter,either,<END>
she,could,hear,him,chuckling,softly,<END>
sometimes,he,was,odious,<END>
in,fact,most,of,the,time,he,was,odious,<END>
it,was,awful,for,a,man,to,know,what,women,really,thought,about,and,talked,about,<END>
it,made,a,girl,feel,positively,undressed,<END>
and,no,man,ever,learned,such,things,from,good,women,either,<END>
she,was,indignant,that,he,had,read,her,mind,<END>

something,in,his,voice,made,her,heart,beat,pleasantly,faster,and,she,felt,her,face,flush,<END>

something,vital,electric,leaped,from,him,to,her,at,the,touch,of,his,warm,mouth,something,that,caressed,her,whole,body,thrillingly,<END>
his,lips,traveled,to,her,wrist,and,she,knew,he,must,feel,the,leap,of,her,pulse,as,her,heart,quickened,and,she,tried,to,draw,back,her,hand,<END>

she,wasn't,in,love,with,him,she,told,herself,confusedly,<END>

he,laughed,softly,<END>
don't,pull,away,<END>
i,won't,hurt,you,<END>

i'm,not,afraid,of,you,rhett,butler,or,of,any,man,in,shoe,leather,<END>

scarlett,you,do,like,me,don't,you,<END>
that,was,more,like,what,she,was,expecting,<END>
well,sometimes,she,answered,cautiously,<END>
when,you,aren't,acting,like,a,varmint,<END>
he,laughed,again,and,held,the,palm,of,her,hand,against,his,hard,cheek,<END>
i,think,you,like,me,because,i,am,a,varmint,<END>
you've,known,so,few,dyed-in-the-wool,varmints,in,your,sheltered,life,that,my,very,difference,holds,a,quaint,charm,for,you,<END>
this,was,not,the,turn,she,had,anticipated,and,she,tried,again,without,success,to,pull,her,hand,free,<END>
that's,not,true,<END>
i,like,nice,men,men,you,can,depend,on,to,always,be,gentlemanly,<END>

it's,merely,a,matter,of,definition,<END>

he,kissed,her,palm,again,and,again,the,skin,on,the,back,of,her,neck,crawled,excitingly,<END>

could,you,ever,love,me,scarlett,<END>
ah,<END>
she,thought,triumphantly,<END>
now,i've,got,him,<END>
and,she,answered,with,studied,coolness,indeed,no,<END>
that,is,not,unless,you,mended,your,manners,considerably,<END>
and,i,have,no,intention,of,mending,them,<END>
so,you,could,not,love,me,<END>

no,i,don't,love,you,<END>

why,he,was,insulting,her,<END>
she,began,to,splutter,wordlessly,<END>

she,was,breathless,with,surprise,at,his,last,words,<END>
in,spite,of,all,his,insults,he,did,love,her,and,he,was,just,so,contrary,he,didn't,want,to,come,out,frankly,and,put,it,into,words,for,fear,she'd,laugh,<END>
well,she'd,show,him,and,right,quickly,<END>
are,you,asking,me,to,marry,you,<END>

good,lord,no,<END>
didn't,i,tell,you,i,wasn't,a,marrying,man,<END>
but,but,what,<END>
he,rose,to,his,feet,and,hand,on,heart,made,her,a,burlesque,bow,<END>
dear,he,said,quietly,i,am,complimenting,your,intelligence,by,asking,you,to,be,my,mistress,without,having,first,seduced,you,<END>
mistress,<END>
her,mind,shouted,the,word,shouted,that,she,had,been,vilely,insulted,<END>

she,only,felt,a,furious,surge,of,indignation,that,he,should,think,her,such,a,fool,<END>
he,must,think,her,a,fool,if,he,offered,her,a,proposition,like,that,instead,of,the,proposal,of,matrimony,she,had,been,expecting,<END>
rage,punctured,vanity,and,disappointment,threw,her,mind,into,a,turmoil,and,before,she,even,thought,of,the,high,moral,grounds,on,which,she,should,upbraid,him,she,blurted,out,the,first,words,which,came,to,her,lips,<END>
mistress,<END>
what,would,i,get,out,of,that,except,a,passel,of,brats,<END>
and,then,her,jaw,dropped,in,horror,as,she,realized,what,she,had,said,<END>
he,laughed,until,he,choked,peering,at,her,in,the,shadows,as,she,sat,stricken,dumb,pressing,her,handkerchief,to,her,mouth,<END>
that's,why,i,like,you,<END>
you,are,the,only,frank,woman,i,know,the,only,woman,who,looks,on,the,practical,side,of,matters,without,beclouding,the,issue,with,mouthings,about,sin,and,morality,<END>
any,other,woman,would,have,swooned,first,and,then,shown,me,the,door,<END>
scarlett,leaped,to,her,feet,her,face,red,with,shame,<END>
how,could,she,have,said,such,a,thing,<END>
how,could,she,ellen's,daughter,with,her,upbringing,have,sat,there,and,listened,to,such,debasing,words,and,then,made,such,a,shameless,reply,<END>
she,should,have,screamed,<END>
she,should,have,fainted,<END>
she,should,have,turned,coldly,away,in,silence,and,swept,from,the,porch,<END>
too,late,now,<END>
i,will,show,you,the,door,she,shouted,not,caring,if,melanie,or,the,meades,down,the,street,did,hear,her,<END>
get,out,<END>

what,have,i,ever,done,to,encourage,you,to,make,you,suppose,<END>

i'll,i'll,tell,my,father,and,he'll,kill,you,<END>
he,picked,up,his,hat,and,bowed,and,she,saw,in,the,light,of,the,lamp,that,his,teeth,were,showing,in,a,smile,beneath,his,mustache,<END>
he,was,not,ashamed,he,was,amused,at,what,she,had,said,and,he,was,watching,her,with,alert,interest,<END>
oh,he,was,detestable,<END>
she,swung,round,on,her,heel,and,marched,into,the,house,<END>
she,grabbed,hold,of,the,door,to,shut,it,with,a,bang,but,the,hook,which,held,it,open,was,too,heavy,for,her,<END>
she,struggled,with,it,panting,<END>

feeling,that,she,would,burst,a,blood,vessel,if,she,stayed,another,minute,she,stormed,up,the,stairs,<END>

the,quiet,that,fell,on,the,town,was,startling,<END>
neighbors,met,on,the,streets,and,stared,at,one,another,uncertain,uneasy,as,to,what,might,be,impending,<END>
the,stillness,after,the,screaming,days,brought,no,surcease,to,strained,nerves,but,if,possible,made,the,strain,even,worse,<END>
no,one,knew,why,the,yankee,batteries,were,silent,there,was,no,news,of,the,troops,except,that,they,had,been,withdrawn,in,large,numbers,from,the,breastworks,about,the,town,and,had,marched,off,toward,the,south,to,defend,the,railroad,<END>

short,of,paper,short,of,ink,short,of,men,the,newspapers,had,suspended,publication,after,the,siege,began,and,the,wildest,rumors,appeared,from,nowhere,and,swept,through,the,town,<END>

but,no,news,came,<END>
the,telegraph,wires,were,still,no,trains,came,in,on,the,one,remaining,railroad,from,the,south,and,the,mail,service,was,broken,<END>
autumn,with,its,dusty,breathless,heat,was,slipping,in,to,choke,the,suddenly,quiet,town,adding,its,dry,panting,weight,to,tired,anxious,hearts,<END>
to,scarlett,mad,to,hear,from,tara,yet,trying,to,keep,up,a,brave,face,it,seemed,an,eternity,since,the,siege,began,seemed,as,though,she,had,always,lived,with,the,sound,of,cannon,in,her,ears,until,this,sinister,quiet,had,fallen,<END>

thirty,days,of,siege,<END>
the,city,ringed,with,red-clay,rifle,pits,the,monotonous,booming,of,cannon,that,never,rested,the,long,lines,of,ambulances,and,ox,carts,dripping,blood,down,the,dusty,streets,toward,the,hospitals,the,overworked,burial,squads,dragging,out,men,when,they,were,hardly,cold,and,dumping,them,like,so,many,logs,in,endless,rows,of,shallow,ditches,<END>
only,thirty,days,<END>
and,it,was,only,four,months,since,the,yankees,moved,south,from,dalton,<END>
only,four,months,<END>
scarlett,thought,looking,back,on,that,far,day,that,it,had,occurred,in,another,life,<END>
oh,no,<END>
surely,not,just,four,months,<END>
it,had,been,a,lifetime,<END>
four,months,ago,<END>
why,four,months,ago,dalton,resaca,kennesaw,mountain,had,been,to,her,only,names,of,places,on,the,railroad,<END>
now,they,were,battles,battles,desperately,vainly,fought,as,johnston,fell,back,toward,atlanta,<END>
and,now,peachtree,creek,decatur,ezra,church,and,utoy,creek,were,no,longer,pleasant,names,of,pleasant,places,<END>
never,again,could,she,think,of,them,as,quiet,villages,full,of,welcoming,friends,as,green,places,where,she,picnicked,with,handsome,officers,on,the,soft,banks,of,slow-moving,streams,<END>
these,names,meant,battles,too,and,the,soft,green,grasses,where,she,had,sat,were,cut,to,bits,by,heavy,cannon,wheels,trampled,by,desperate,feet,when,bayonet,met,bayonet,and,flattened,where,bodies,threshed,in,agonies,<END>

at,last,news,came,from,the,south,to,the,strained,town,and,it,was,alarming,news,especially,to,scarlett,<END>
general,sherman,was,trying,the,fourth,side,of,the,town,again,striking,again,at,the,railroad,at,jonesboro,<END>
yankees,in,large,numbers,were,on,that,fourth,side,of,the,town,now,no,skirmishing,units,or,cavalry,detachments,but,the,massed,yankee,forces,<END>
and,thousands,of,confederate,troops,had,been,withdrawn,from,the,lines,close,about,the,city,to,hurl,themselves,against,them,<END>
and,that,explained,the,sudden,silence,<END>
why,jonesboro,<END>
thought,scarlett,terror,striking,at,her,heart,at,the,thought,of,tara's,nearness,<END>
why,must,they,always,hit,jonesboro,<END>
why,can't,they,find,some,other,place,to,attack,the,railroad,<END>
for,a,week,she,had,not,heard,from,tara,and,the,last,brief,note,from,gerald,had,added,to,her,fears,<END>

there,was,fighting,at,jonesboro,that,much,atlanta,knew,but,how,the,battle,went,no,one,could,tell,and,the,most,insane,rumors,tortured,the,town,<END>
finally,a,courier,came,up,from,jonesboro,with,the,reassuring,news,that,the,yankees,had,been,beaten,back,<END>
but,they,had,made,a,sortie,into,jonesboro,burned,the,depot,cut,the,telegraph,wires,and,torn,up,three,miles,of,track,before,they,retreated,<END>
the,engineering,corps,was,working,like,mad,repairing,the,line,but,it,would,take,some,time,because,the,yankees,had,torn,up,the,crossties,made,bonfires,of,them,laid,the,wrenched-up,rails,across,them,until,they,were,red,hot,and,then,twisted,them,around,telegraph,poles,until,they,looked,like,giant,corkscrews,<END>
these,days,it,was,so,hard,to,replace,iron,rails,to,replace,anything,made,of,iron,<END>
no,the,yankees,hadn't,gotten,to,tara,<END>
the,same,courier,who,brought,the,dispatches,to,general,hood,assured,scarlett,of,that,<END>
he,had,met,gerald,in,jonesboro,after,the,battle,just,as,he,was,starting,to,atlanta,and,gerald,had,begged,him,to,bring,a,letter,to,her,<END>

the,young,courier,looked,ill,at,ease,as,he,made,answer,<END>
gerald,was,hunting,for,an,army,doctor,to,go,to,tara,with,him,<END>
as,she,stood,in,the,sunshine,on,the,front,porch,thanking,the,young,man,for,his,trouble,scarlett,felt,her,knees,go,weak,<END>

as,the,courier,went,off,in,a,small,whirlwind,of,red,dust,scarlett,tore,open,gerald's,letter,with,fingers,that,trembled,<END>
so,great,was,the,shortage,of,paper,in,the,confederacy,now,that,gerald's,note,was,written,between,the,lines,of,her,last,letter,to,him,and,reading,it,was,difficult,<END>
dear,daughter,your,mother,and,both,girls,have,the,typhoid,<END>

for,the,next,week,scarlett,crept,about,the,house,like,a,stricken,animal,waiting,for,news,starting,at,every,sound,of,horses',hooves,rushing,down,the,dark,stair,at,night,when,soldiers,came,tapping,at,the,door,but,no,news,came,from,tara,<END>
the,width,of,the,continent,might,have,spread,between,her,and,home,instead,of,twenty-,five,miles,of,dusty,road,<END>
the,mails,were,still,disrupted,no,one,knew,where,the,confederates,were,or,what,the,yankees,were,up,to,<END>

home,<END>
the,sprawling,white,house,with,fluttering,white,curtains,at,the,windows,the,thick,clover,on,the,lawn,with,the,bees,busy,in,it,the,little,black,boy,on,the,front,steps,shooing,the,ducks,and,turkeys,from,the,flower,beds,the,serene,red,fields,and,the,miles,and,miles,of,cotton,turning,white,in,the,sun,<END>

there,had,been,stimulation,in,the,noise,and,the,danger,of,the,shelling,<END>

the,last,day,of,august,came,and,with,it,convincing,rumors,that,the,fiercest,fighting,since,the,battle,of,atlanta,was,taking,place,<END>
somewhere,to,the,south,<END>
atlanta,waiting,for,news,of,the,turn,of,battle,stopped,even,trying,to,laugh,and,joke,<END>

the,air,was,oppressive,even,in,the,early,morning,hour,hot,with,the,scorching,promise,of,a,noon,of,glaring,blue,sky,and,pitiless,bronze,sun,<END>

farther,down,the,street,the,business,section,was,quiet,and,many,of,the,stores,and,offices,were,locked,and,boarded,up,while,their,occupants,were,somewhere,about,the,countryside,with,rifles,in,their,hands,<END>
the,stillness,that,greeted,her,seemed,even,more,sinister,this,morning,than,on,any,of,the,mornings,of,the,queer,quiet,week,preceding,it,<END>
she,rose,hastily,without,her,usual,preliminary,burrowings,and,stretchings,and,went,to,the,window,hoping,to,see,some,neighbor's,face,some,heartening,sight,<END>

she,noted,how,the,leaves,on,the,trees,were,still,dark,green,but,dry,and,heavily,coated,with,red,dust,and,how,withered,and,sad,the,untended,flowers,in,the,front,yard,looked,<END>

it,was,the,thought,of,sherman's,thousands,so,close,to,tara,that,brought,it,all,home,to,her,brought,the,full,horror,of,the,war,to,her,as,no,sound,of,siege,guns,shattering,windowpanes,no,privations,of,food,and,clothing,and,no,endless,rows,of,dying,men,had,done,<END>

after,sending,up,melanie's,breakfast,tray,scarlett,dispatched,prissy,for,mrs,meade,and,sat,down,with,wade,to,eat,her,own,breakfast,<END>
but,for,once,she,had,no,appetite,<END>
between,her,nervous,apprehension,over,the,thought,that,melanie's,time,was,approaching,and,her,unconscious,straining,to,hear,the,sound,of,the,cannon,she,could,hardly,eat,<END>
her,heart,acted,very,queerly,beating,regularly,for,several,minutes,and,then,thumping,so,loudly,and,swiftly,it,almost,made,her,sick,at,her,stomach,<END>

without,sugar,or,cream,it,was,bitter,as,gall,for,the,sorghum,used,for,long,sweetening,did,little,to,improve,the,taste,<END>

wade,was,quieter,than,usual,and,did,not,set,up,his,every,morning,complaint,against,the,hominy,that,he,so,disliked,<END>
he,ate,silently,the,spoonfuls,she,pushed,into,his,mouth,and,washed,them,down,with,noisily,gulped,water,<END>
his,soft,brown,eyes,followed,her,every,movement,large,round,as,dollars,a,childish,bewilderment,in,them,as,though,her,own,scarce-hidden,fears,had,been,communicated,to,him,<END>
when,he,had,finished,she,sent,him,off,to,the,back,yard,to,play,and,watched,him,toddle,across,the,straggling,grass,to,his,playhouse,with,great,relief,<END>
she,arose,and,stood,irresolutely,at,the,foot,of,the,stairs,<END>

how,strange,to,have,a,big,battle,going,on,just,a,few,miles,away,and,to,know,nothing,of,it,<END>

if,only,everyone,except,the,meades,and,the,merriwethers,had,not,refugeed,from,this,north,end,of,peachtree,<END>
it,made,her,feel,forsaken,and,alone,<END>
she,wished,fervently,that,uncle,peter,were,with,her,so,he,could,go,down,to,headquarters,and,learn,the,news,<END>
if,it,wasn't,for,melanie,she'd,go,to,town,this,very,minute,and,learn,for,herself,but,she,couldn't,leave,until,mrs,meade,arrived,<END>

miss,melanie,will,hear,you,<END>
now,go,change,your,apron,quick,<END>
spurred,to,speed,prissy,hurried,toward,the,back,of,the,house,while,scarlett,scratched,a,hasty,note,on,the,margin,of,gerald's,last,letter,to,her,the,only,bit,of,paper,in,the,house,<END>
as,she,folded,it,so,that,her,note,was,uppermost,she,caught,gerald's,words,your,mother,typhoid,under,no,condition,to,come,home,she,almost,sobbed,<END>
if,it,wasn't,for,melanie,she'd,start,home,right,this,minute,if,she,had,to,walk,every,step,of,the,way,<END>
prissy,went,off,at,a,trot,the,letter,gripped,in,her,hand,and,scarlett,went,back,upstairs,trying,to,think,of,some,plausible,lie,to,explain,mrs,elsing's,failure,to,appear,<END>
but,melanie,asked,no,questions,<END>
she,lay,upon,her,back,her,face,tranquil,and,sweet,and,the,sight,of,her,quieted,scarlett,for,a,while,<END>
she,sat,down,and,tried,to,talk,of,inconsequential,things,but,the,thoughts,of,tara,and,a,possible,defeat,by,the,yankees,prodded,cruelly,<END>
she,thought,of,ellen,dying,and,of,the,yankees,coming,into,atlanta,burning,everything,killing,everybody,<END>
through,it,all,the,dull,far-off,thundering,persisted,rolling,into,her,ears,in,waves,of,fear,<END>
finally,she,could,not,talk,at,all,and,only,stared,out,of,the,window,at,the,hot,still,street,and,the,dusty,leaves,hanging,motionless,on,the,trees,<END>
melanie,was,silent,too,but,at,intervals,her,quiet,face,was,wrenched,with,pain,<END>
she,said,after,each,pain,it,wasn't,very,bad,really,and,scarlett,knew,she,was,lying,<END>
she,would,have,preferred,a,loud,scream,to,silent,endurance,<END>
she,knew,she,should,feel,sorry,for,melanie,but,somehow,she,could,not,muster,a,spark,of,sympathy,<END>
her,mind,was,too,torn,with,her,own,anguish,<END>
once,she,looked,sharply,at,the,pain-twisted,face,and,wondered,why,it,should,be,that,she,of,all,people,in,the,world,should,be,here,with,melanie,at,this,particular,time,she,who,had,nothing,in,common,with,her,who,hated,her,who,would,gladly,have,seen,her,dead,<END>
well,maybe,she'd,have,her,wish,and,before,the,day,was,over,too,<END>
a,cold,superstitious,fear,swept,her,at,this,thought,<END>
it,was,bad,luck,to,wish,that,someone,were,dead,almost,as,bad,luck,as,to,curse,someone,<END>
curses,came,home,to,roost,mammy,said,<END>
she,hastily,prayed,that,melanie,wouldn't,die,and,broke,into,feverish,small,talk,hardly,aware,of,what,she,said,<END>
at,last,melanie,put,a,hot,hand,on,her,wrist,<END>
don't,bother,about,talking,dear,<END>
i,know,how,worried,you,are,<END>
i'm,so,sorry,i'm,so,much,trouble,<END>
scarlett,relapsed,into,silence,but,she,could,not,sit,still,<END>
what,would,she,do,if,neither,the,doctor,nor,prissy,got,there,in,time,<END>
she,walked,to,the,window,and,looked,down,the,street,and,came,back,and,sat,down,again,<END>
then,she,rose,and,looked,out,of,the,window,on,the,other,side,of,the,room,<END>
an,hour,went,by,and,then,another,<END>
noon,came,and,the,sun,was,high,and,hot,and,not,a,breath,of,air,stirred,the,dusty,leaves,<END>
melanie's,pains,were,harder,now,<END>
her,long,hair,was,drenched,in,sweat,and,her,gown,stuck,in,wet,spots,to,her,body,<END>
scarlett,sponged,her,face,in,silence,but,fear,was,gnawing,at,her,<END>
god,in,heaven,suppose,the,baby,came,before,the,doctor,arrived,<END>
what,would,she,do,<END>
she,knew,less,than,nothing,of,midwifery,<END>
this,was,exactly,the,emergency,she,had,been,dreading,for,weeks,<END>
she,had,been,counting,on,prissy,to,handle,the,situation,if,no,doctor,should,be,available,<END>
prissy,knew,all,about,midwifery,<END>
she'd,said,so,time,and,again,<END>
but,where,was,prissy,<END>
why,didn't,she,come,<END>
why,didn't,the,doctor,come,<END>
she,went,to,the,window,and,looked,again,<END>
she,listened,hard,and,suddenly,she,wondered,if,it,were,only,her,imagination,or,if,the,sound,of,cannon,in,the,distance,had,died,away,<END>
if,it,were,farther,away,it,would,mean,that,the,fighting,was,nearer,jonesboro,and,that,would,mean,<END>
at,last,she,saw,prissy,coming,down,the,street,at,a,quick,trot,and,she,leaned,out,of,the,window,<END>
prissy,looking,up,saw,her,and,her,mouth,opened,to,yell,<END>
seeing,the,panic,written,on,the,little,black,face,and,fearing,she,might,alarm,melanie,by,crying,out,evil,tidings,scarlett,hastily,put,her,finger,to,her,lips,and,left,the,window,<END>
i'll,get,some,cooler,water,she,said,looking,down,into,melanie's,dark,deep-circled,eyes,and,trying,to,smile,<END>
then,she,hastily,left,the,room,closing,the,door,carefully,behind,her,<END>
prissy,was,sitting,on,the,bottom,step,in,the,hall,panting,<END>

cold,little,ripples,of,fear,that,started,in,the,pit,of,her,stomach,were,radiating,outward,until,the,fingers,that,touched,her,cheeks,were,cold,though,the,rest,of,her,body,streamed,perspiration,<END>
she,hurried,out,of,the,house,and,into,the,heat,of,the,sun,<END>

the,yankees,are,coming,<END>
five,points,was,crowded,with,people,who,rushed,here,and,there,with,unseeing,eyes,jammed,with,wagons,ambulances,ox,carts,carriages,loaded,with,wounded,<END>
a,roaring,sound,like,the,breaking,of,surf,rose,from,the,crowd,<END>
then,a,strangely,incongruous,sight,struck,her,eyes,<END>
throngs,of,women,were,coming,up,from,the,direction,of,the,railroad,tracks,carrying,hams,across,their,shoulders,<END>
little,children,hurried,by,their,sides,staggering,under,buckets,of,steaming,molasses,<END>

the,crowd,suddenly,gave,a,lane,for,a,careening,carriage,and,through,the,lane,came,the,frail,and,elegant,mrs,elsing,standing,up,in,the,front,of,her,victoria,reins,in,one,hand,whip,in,the,other,<END>
she,was,hatless,and,white,faced,and,her,long,gray,hair,streamed,down,her,back,as,she,lashed,the,horse,like,a,fury,<END>
jouncing,on,the,back,seat,of,the,carriage,was,her,black,mammy,melissy,clutching,a,greasy,side,of,bacon,to,her,with,one,hand,while,with,the,other,and,both,feet,she,attempted,to,hold,the,boxes,and,bags,piled,all,about,her,<END>
one,bag,of,dried,peas,had,burst,and,the,peas,strewed,themselves,into,the,street,<END>
scarlett,screamed,to,her,but,the,tumult,of,the,crowd,drowned,her,voice,and,the,carriage,rocked,madly,by,<END>
for,a,moment,she,could,not,understand,what,it,all,meant,and,then,remembering,that,the,commissary,warehouses,were,down,by,the,railroad,tracks,she,realized,that,the,army,had,thrown,them,open,to,the,people,to,salvage,what,they,could,before,the,yankees,came,<END>
she,pushed,her,way,swiftly,through,the,crowds,past,the,packed,hysterical,mob,surging,in,the,open,space,of,five,points,and,hurried,as,fast,as,she,could,down,the,short,block,toward,the,depot,<END>
through,the,tangle,of,ambulances,and,the,clouds,of,dust,she,could,see,doctors,and,stretcher,bearers,bending,lifting,hurrying,<END>

lying,in,the,pitiless,sun,shoulder,to,shoulder,head,to,feet,were,hundreds,of,wounded,men,lining,the,tracks,the,sidewalks,stretched,out,in,endless,rows,under,the,car,shed,<END>
some,lay,stiff,and,still,but,many,writhed,under,the,hot,sun,moaning,<END>
everywhere,swarms,of,flies,hovered,over,the,men,crawling,and,buzzing,in,their,faces,everywhere,was,blood,dirty,bandages,groans,screamed,curses,of,pain,as,stretcher,bearers,lifted,men,<END>
the,smell,of,sweat,of,blood,of,unwashed,bodies,of,excrement,rose,up,in,waves,of,blistering,heat,until,the,fetid,stench,almost,nauseated,her,<END>
the,ambulance,men,hurrying,here,and,there,among,the,prostrate,forms,frequently,stepped,on,wounded,men,so,thickly,packed,were,the,rows,and,those,trodden,upon,stared,stolidly,up,waiting,their,turn,<END>

his,shirt,and,trousers,were,as,red,as,a,butcher's,and,even,the,end,of,his,iron-gray,beard,was,matted,with,blood,<END>

what,did,the,doctor,mean,<END>
the,dust,from,the,ambulances,came,into,her,face,with,choking,dryness,and,the,rotten,smells,were,like,a,foul,liquid,in,her,nostrils,<END>

she,wondered,if,he,would,still,be,here,if,he,did,know,and,something,told,her,that,even,if,phil,were,dying,he,would,still,be,standing,on,this,spot,giving,aid,to,the,many,instead,of,the,one,<END>

the,man,at,her,feet,looked,up,at,scarlett,compassionately,<END>

began,to,beat,its,refrain,in,her,mind,again,<END>
her,heart,began,to,pound,and,new,life,came,into,her,limbs,<END>
she,hurried,into,the,crowd,at,five,points,now,so,thick,there,was,no,room,on,the,narrow,sidewalks,and,she,was,forced,to,walk,in,the,street,<END>
long,lines,of,soldiers,were,passing,dust,covered,sodden,with,weariness,<END>

the,hurrying,lines,pushed,her,back,onto,the,packed,sidewalk,and,she,smelled,the,reek,of,cheap,corn,whisky,<END>
there,were,women,in,the,mob,near,decatur,street,garishly,dressed,women,whose,bright,finery,and,painted,faces,gave,a,discordant,note,of,holiday,<END>
most,of,them,were,drunk,and,the,soldiers,on,whose,arms,they,hung,were,drunker,<END>
she,caught,a,fleeting,glimpse,of,a,head,of,red,curls,and,saw,that,creature,belle,watling,heard,her,shrill,drunken,laughter,as,she,clung,for,support,to,a,one-armed,soldier,who,reeled,and,staggered,<END>
when,she,had,shoved,and,pushed,her,way,through,the,mob,for,a,block,beyond,five,points,the,crowd,thinned,a,little,and,gathering,up,her,skirts,she,began,to,run,again,<END>
when,she,reached,wesley,chapel,she,was,breathless,and,dizzy,and,sick,at,her,stomach,<END>
her,stays,were,cutting,her,ribs,in,two,<END>
she,sank,down,on,the,steps,of,the,church,and,buried,her,head,in,her,hands,until,she,could,breathe,more,easily,<END>
if,she,could,only,get,one,deep,breath,way,down,in,her,abdomen,<END>
if,her,heart,would,only,stop,bumping,and,drumming,and,cavorting,<END>

there,had,always,been,someone,to,do,things,for,her,to,look,after,her,shelter,and,protect,her,and,spoil,her,<END>
it,was,incredible,that,she,could,be,in,such,a,fix,<END>
not,a,friend,not,a,neighbor,to,help,her,<END>
there,had,always,been,friends,neighbors,the,competent,hands,of,willing,slaves,<END>

it,was,incredible,that,she,could,be,so,completely,alone,and,frightened,and,far,from,home,<END>
home,<END>
if,she,were,only,home,yankees,or,no,yankees,<END>
home,even,if,ellen,was,sick,<END>

she,rose,dizzily,to,her,feet,and,started,walking,again,<END>
when,she,came,in,sight,of,the,house,she,saw,wade,swinging,on,the,front,gate,<END>
when,he,saw,her,his,face,puckered,and,he,began,to,cry,holding,up,a,grubby,bruised,finger,<END>

she,looked,up,and,saw,prissy,leaning,out,of,the,upstairs,window,fright,and,worry,written,on,her,face,but,in,an,instant,they,were,wiped,away,in,relief,as,she,saw,her,mistress,<END>
scarlett,beckoned,to,her,to,come,down,and,went,into,the,house,<END>
how,cool,it,was,in,the,hall,<END>
she,untied,her,bonnet,and,flung,it,on,the,table,drawing,her,forearms,across,her,wet,forehead,<END>
she,heard,the,upstairs,door,open,and,a,low,wailing,moan,wrenched,from,the,depths,of,agony,came,to,her,ears,<END>

prissy's,mouth,fell,open,and,her,tongue,wagged,wordlessly,<END>
she,looked,at,scarlett,sideways,and,scuffed,her,feet,and,twisted,her,thin,body,<END>
don't,look,so,simple,minded,<END>
cried,scarlett,infuriated,at,her,silly,expression,<END>

all,the,breath,went,out,of,scarlett's,lungs,in,one,gasp,of,horror,before,rage,swept,her,<END>
prissy,made,a,lunge,past,her,bent,on,flight,but,scarlett,grabbed,her,<END>
you,black,liar,what,do,you,mean,<END>
you've,been,saying,you,knew,everything,about,birthing,babies,<END>

scarlett,glared,at,her,and,prissy,shrank,back,trying,to,pull,loose,<END>
for,a,moment,her,mind,refused,to,accept,the,truth,but,when,realization,finally,came,to,her,that,prissy,knew,no,more,about,midwifery,than,she,did,anger,went,over,her,like,a,flame,<END>
she,had,never,struck,a,slave,in,all,her,life,but,now,she,slapped,the,black,cheek,with,all,the,force,in,her,tired,arm,<END>
prissy,screamed,at,the,top,of,her,voice,more,from,fright,than,pain,and,began,to,dance,up,and,down,writhing,to,break,scarlett's,grip,<END>
as,she,screamed,the,moaning,from,the,second,floor,ceased,and,a,moment,later,melanie's,voice,weak,and,trembling,called,scarlett,<END>
is,it,you,<END>
please,come,<END>
please,<END>
scarlett,dropped,prissy's,arm,and,the,wench,sank,whimpering,to,the,steps,<END>
for,a,moment,scarlett,stood,still,looking,up,listening,to,the,low,moaning,which,had,begun,again,<END>
as,she,stood,there,it,seemed,as,though,a,yoke,descended,heavily,upon,her,neck,felt,as,though,a,heavy,load,were,harnessed,to,it,a,load,she,would,feel,as,soon,as,she,took,a,step,<END>
she,tried,to,think,of,all,the,things,mammy,and,ellen,had,done,for,her,when,wade,was,born,but,the,merciful,blurring,of,the,childbirth,pains,obscured,almost,everything,in,mist,<END>
she,did,recall,a,few,things,and,she,spoke,to,prissy,rapidly,authority,in,her,voice,<END>
build,a,fire,in,the,stove,and,keep,hot,water,boiling,in,the,kettle,<END>
and,bring,up,all,the,towels,you,can,find,and,that,ball,of,twine,<END>
and,get,me,the,scissors,<END>
don't,come,telling,me,you,can't,find,them,<END>
get,them,and,get,them,quick,<END>
now,hurry,<END>
she,jerked,prissy,to,her,feet,and,sent,her,kitchenwards,with,a,shove,<END>
then,she,squared,her,shoulders,and,started,up,the,stairs,<END>
it,was,going,to,be,difficult,telling,melanie,that,she,and,prissy,were,to,deliver,her,baby,<END>
chapter,xxii,<END>
there,would,never,again,be,an,afternoon,as,long,as,this,one,<END>
or,as,hot,<END>
or,as,full,of,lazy,insolent,flies,<END>
they,swarmed,on,melanie,despite,the,fan,scarlett,kept,in,constant,motion,<END>
her,arms,ached,from,swinging,the,wide,palmetto,leaf,<END>
all,her,efforts,seemed,futile,for,while,she,brushed,them,from,melanie's,moist,face,they,crawled,on,her,clammy,feet,and,legs,and,made,her,jerk,them,weakly,and,cry,please,<END>
on,my,feet,<END>
the,room,was,in,semigloom,for,scarlett,had,pulled,down,the,shades,to,shut,out,the,heat,and,brightness,<END>
pin,points,of,sunlight,came,in,through,minute,holes,in,the,shades,and,about,the,edges,<END>
the,room,was,an,oven,and,scarlett's,sweat-drenched,clothes,never,dried,but,became,wetter,and,stickier,as,the,hours,went,by,<END>
prissy,was,crouched,in,a,corner,sweating,too,and,smelled,so,abominably,scarlett,would,have,sent,her,from,the,room,had,she,not,feared,the,girl,would,take,to,her,heels,if,once,out,of,sight,<END>
melanie,lay,on,the,bed,on,a,sheet,dark,with,perspiration,and,splotched,with,dampness,where,scarlett,had,spilled,water,<END>
she,twisted,endlessly,to,one,side,to,the,other,to,left,to,right,and,back,again,<END>
sometimes,she,tried,to,sit,up,and,fell,back,and,began,twisting,again,<END>
at,first,she,had,tried,to,keep,from,crying,out,biting,her,lips,until,they,were,raw,and,scarlett,whose,nerves,were,as,raw,as,the,lips,said,huskily,melly,for,god's,sake,don't,try,to,be,brave,<END>
yell,if,you,want,to,<END>
there's,nobody,to,hear,you,but,us,<END>
as,the,afternoon,wore,on,melanie,moaned,whether,she,wanted,to,be,brave,or,not,and,sometimes,she,screamed,<END>
when,she,did,scarlett,dropped,her,head,into,her,hands,and,covered,her,ears,and,twisted,her,body,and,wished,that,she,herself,were,dead,<END>
anything,was,preferable,to,being,a,helpless,witness,to,such,pain,<END>
anything,was,better,than,being,tied,here,waiting,for,a,baby,that,took,such,a,long,time,coming,<END>
waiting,when,for,all,she,knew,the,yankees,were,actually,at,five,points,<END>
she,fervently,wished,she,had,paid,more,attention,to,the,whispered,conversations,of,matrons,on,the,subject,of,childbirth,<END>
if,only,she,had,<END>
if,only,she,had,been,more,interested,in,such,matters,she'd,know,whether,melanie,was,taking,a,long,time,or,not,<END>
she,had,a,vague,memory,of,one,of,aunt,pitty's,stories,of,a,friend,who,was,in,labor,for,two,days,and,died,without,ever,having,the,baby,<END>
suppose,melanie,should,go,on,like,this,for,two,days,<END>
but,melanie,was,so,delicate,<END>
she,couldn't,stand,two,days,of,this,pain,<END>
she'd,die,soon,if,the,baby,didn't,hurry,<END>
and,how,could,she,ever,face,ashley,if,he,were,still,alive,and,tell,him,that,melanie,had,died,after,she,had,promised,to,take,care,of,her,<END>
at,first,melanie,wanted,to,hold,scarlett's,hand,when,the,pain,was,bad,but,she,clamped,down,on,it,so,hard,she,nearly,broke,the,bones,<END>
after,an,hour,of,this,scarlett's,hands,were,so,swollen,and,bruised,she,could,hardly,flex,them,<END>
she,knotted,two,long,towels,together,and,tied,them,to,the,foot,of,the,bed,and,put,the,knotted,end,in,melanie's,hands,<END>
melanie,hung,onto,it,as,though,it,were,a,life,line,straining,pulling,it,taut,slackening,it,tearing,it,<END>
throughout,the,afternoon,her,voice,went,on,like,an,animal,dying,in,a,trap,<END>
occasionally,she,dropped,the,towel,and,rubbed,her,hands,feebly,and,looked,up,at,scarlett,with,eyes,enormous,with,pain,<END>
talk,to,me,<END>
please,talk,to,me,she,whispered,and,scarlett,would,gabble,something,until,melanie,again,gripped,the,knot,and,again,began,writhing,<END>
the,dim,room,swam,with,heat,and,pain,and,droning,flies,and,time,went,by,on,such,dragging,feet,scarlett,could,scarcely,remember,the,morning,<END>
she,felt,as,if,she,had,been,in,this,steaming,dark,sweating,place,all,her,life,<END>
she,wanted,very,much,to,scream,every,time,melanie,did,and,only,by,biting,her,lips,so,hard,it,infuriated,her,could,she,restrain,herself,and,drive,off,hysteria,<END>
once,wade,came,tiptoeing,up,the,stairs,and,stood,outside,the,door,wailing,<END>
wade,hungwy,<END>
scarlett,started,to,go,to,him,but,melanie,whispered,don't,leave,me,<END>
please,<END>
i,can,stand,it,when,you're,here,<END>
so,scarlett,sent,prissy,down,to,warm,up,the,breakfast,hominy,and,feed,him,<END>
for,herself,she,felt,that,she,could,never,eat,again,after,this,afternoon,<END>
the,clock,on,the,mantel,had,stopped,and,she,had,no,way,of,telling,the,time,but,as,the,heat,in,the,room,lessened,and,the,bright,pin,points,of,light,grew,duller,she,pulled,the,shade,aside,<END>
she,saw,to,her,surprise,that,it,was,late,afternoon,and,the,sun,a,ball,of,crimson,was,far,down,the,sky,<END>
somehow,she,had,imagined,it,would,remain,broiling,hot,noon,forever,<END>
she,wondered,passionately,what,was,going,on,downtown,<END>
had,all,the,troops,moved,out,yet,<END>
had,the,yankees,come,<END>
would,the,confederates,march,away,without,even,a,fight,<END>
then,she,remembered,with,a,sick,dropping,in,her,stomach,how,few,confederates,there,were,and,how,many,men,sherman,had,and,how,well,fed,they,were,<END>
sherman,<END>
the,name,of,satan,himself,did,not,frighten,her,half,so,much,<END>
but,there,was,no,time,for,thinking,now,as,melanie,called,for,water,for,a,cold,towel,on,her,head,to,be,fanned,to,have,the,flies,brushed,away,from,her,face,<END>
when,twilight,came,on,and,prissy,scurrying,like,a,black,wraith,lit,a,lamp,melanie,became,weaker,<END>
she,began,calling,for,ashley,over,and,over,as,if,in,a,delirium,until,the,hideous,monotony,gave,scarlett,a,fierce,desire,to,smother,her,voice,with,a,pillow,<END>
perhaps,the,doctor,would,come,after,all,<END>
if,he,would,only,come,quickly,<END>
hope,raising,its,head,she,turned,to,prissy,and,ordered,her,to,run,quickly,to,the,meades',house,and,see,if,he,were,there,or,mrs,meade,<END>
and,if,he's,not,there,ask,mrs,meade,or,cookie,what,to,do,<END>
beg,them,to,come,<END>
prissy,was,off,with,a,clatter,and,scarlett,watched,her,hurrying,down,the,street,going,faster,than,she,had,ever,dreamed,the,worthless,child,could,move,<END>
after,a,prolonged,time,she,was,back,alone,<END>

scarlett,wanted,to,slap,her,again,for,this,helpful,information,but,melanie,opened,wide,dilated,eyes,and,whispered,dear,are,the,yankees,coming,<END>
no,said,scarlett,stoutly,<END>
prissy's,a,liar,<END>
yas'm,ah,sho,is,prissy,agreed,fervently,<END>
they're,coming,whispered,melanie,undeceived,and,buried,her,face,in,the,pillow,<END>
her,voice,came,out,muffled,<END>
my,poor,baby,<END>
my,poor,baby,<END>
and,after,a,long,interval,oh,scarlett,you,mustn't,stay,here,<END>
you,must,go,and,take,wade,<END>
what,melanie,said,was,no,more,than,scarlett,had,been,thinking,but,hearing,it,put,into,words,infuriated,her,shamed,her,as,if,her,secret,cowardice,was,written,plainly,in,her,face,<END>
don't,be,a,goose,<END>
i'm,not,afraid,<END>
you,know,i,won't,leave,you,<END>
you,might,as,well,<END>
i'm,going,to,die,<END>
and,she,began,moaning,again,<END>
scarlett,came,down,the,dark,stairs,slowly,like,an,old,woman,feeling,her,way,clinging,to,the,banisters,lest,she,fall,<END>
her,legs,were,leaden,trembling,with,fatigue,and,strain,and,she,shivered,with,cold,from,the,clammy,sweat,that,soaked,her,body,<END>
feebly,she,made,her,way,onto,the,front,porch,and,sank,down,on,the,top,step,<END>
she,sprawled,back,against,a,pillar,of,the,porch,and,with,a,shaking,hand,unbuttoned,her,basque,halfway,down,her,bosom,<END>
the,night,was,drenched,in,warm,soft,darkness,and,she,lay,staring,into,it,dull,as,an,ox,<END>
it,was,all,over,<END>
melanie,was,not,dead,and,the,small,baby,boy,who,made,noises,like,a,young,kitten,was,receiving,his,first,bath,at,prissy's,hands,<END>
melanie,was,asleep,<END>
how,could,she,sleep,after,that,nightmare,of,screaming,pain,and,ignorant,midwifery,that,hurt,more,than,it,helped,<END>
why,wasn't,she,dead,<END>
scarlett,knew,that,she,herself,would,have,died,under,such,handling,<END>
but,when,it,was,over,melanie,had,even,whispered,so,weakly,she,had,to,bend,over,her,to,hear,thank,you,<END>
and,then,she,had,gone,to,sleep,<END>
how,could,she,go,to,sleep,<END>
scarlett,forgot,that,she,too,had,gone,to,sleep,after,wade,was,born,<END>
she,forgot,everything,<END>

she,heard,her,own,breath,pass,from,loud,evenness,to,spasmodic,sobbing,but,her,eyes,were,dry,and,burning,as,though,there,would,never,be,tears,in,them,again,<END>
slowly,laboriously,she,heaved,herself,over,and,pulled,her,heavy,skirts,up,to,her,thighs,<END>

she,lay,back,against,the,pillar,in,silence,and,prissy,aware,of,her,mood,tiptoed,away,into,the,darkness,of,the,porch,<END>
after,a,long,interval,in,which,her,breathing,finally,quieted,and,her,mind,steadied,scarlett,heard,the,sound,of,faint,voices,from,up,the,road,the,tramping,of,many,feet,coming,from,the,north,<END>

she,sat,up,slowly,pulling,down,her,skirts,although,she,knew,no,one,could,see,her,in,the,darkness,<END>

she,heard,the,patter,of,prissy's,feet,as,she,broke,into,a,trot,and,then,the,sound,died,away,on,the,soft,earth,<END>
chapter,xxiii,<END>
after,prissy,had,gone,scarlett,went,wearily,into,the,downstairs,hall,and,lit,a,lamp,<END>
the,house,felt,steamingly,hot,as,though,it,held,in,its,walls,all,the,heat,of,the,noontide,<END>
some,of,her,dullness,was,passing,now,and,her,stomach,was,clamoring,for,food,<END>
she,remembered,she,had,had,nothing,to,eat,since,the,night,before,except,a,spoonful,of,hominy,and,picking,up,the,lamp,she,went,into,the,kitchen,<END>
the,fire,in,the,oven,had,died,but,the,room,was,stifling,hot,<END>
she,found,half,a,pone,of,hard,corn,bread,in,the,skillet,and,gnawed,hungrily,on,it,while,she,looked,about,for,other,food,<END>
there,was,some,hominy,left,in,the,pot,and,she,ate,it,with,a,big,cooking,spoon,not,waiting,to,put,it,on,a,plate,<END>
it,needed,salt,badly,but,she,was,too,hungry,to,hunt,for,it,<END>
after,four,spoonfuls,of,it,the,heat,of,the,room,was,too,much,and,taking,the,lamp,in,one,hand,and,a,fragment,of,pone,in,the,other,she,went,out,into,the,hall,<END>
she,knew,she,should,go,upstairs,and,sit,beside,melanie,<END>
if,anything,went,wrong,melanie,would,be,too,weak,to,call,<END>
but,the,idea,of,returning,to,that,room,where,she,had,spent,so,many,nightmare,hours,was,repulsive,to,her,<END>
even,if,melanie,were,dying,she,couldn't,go,back,up,there,<END>
she,never,wanted,to,see,that,room,again,<END>
she,set,the,lamp,on,the,candle,stand,by,the,window,and,returned,to,the,front,porch,<END>
it,was,so,much,cooler,here,and,even,the,night,was,drowned,in,soft,warmth,<END>
she,sat,down,on,the,steps,in,the,circle,of,faint,light,thrown,by,the,lamp,and,continued,gnawing,on,the,corn,bread,<END>
when,she,had,finished,it,a,measure,of,strength,came,back,to,her,and,with,the,strength,came,again,the,pricking,of,fear,<END>
she,could,hear,a,humming,of,noise,far,down,the,street,but,what,it,portended,she,did,not,know,<END>
she,could,distinguish,nothing,but,a,volume,of,sound,that,rose,and,fell,<END>
she,strained,forward,trying,to,hear,and,soon,she,found,her,muscles,aching,from,the,tension,<END>
more,than,anything,in,the,world,she,yearned,to,hear,the,sound,of,hooves,and,to,see,rhett's,careless,self-confident,eyes,laughing,at,her,fears,<END>
rhett,would,take,them,away,somewhere,<END>
she,didn't,know,where,<END>
she,didn't,care,<END>
as,she,sat,straining,her,ears,toward,town,a,faint,glow,appeared,above,the,trees,<END>
it,puzzled,her,<END>
she,watched,it,and,saw,it,grow,brighter,<END>
the,dark,sky,became,pink,and,then,dull,red,and,suddenly,above,the,trees,she,saw,a,huge,tongue,of,flame,leap,high,to,the,heavens,<END>
she,jumped,to,her,feet,her,heart,beginning,again,its,sickening,thudding,and,bumping,<END>
the,yankees,had,come,<END>
she,knew,they,had,come,and,they,were,burning,the,town,<END>
the,flames,seemed,to,be,off,to,the,east,of,the,center,of,town,<END>
they,shot,higher,and,higher,and,widened,rapidly,into,a,broad,expanse,of,red,before,her,terrified,eyes,<END>
a,whole,block,must,be,burning,<END>
a,faint,hot,breeze,that,had,sprung,up,bore,the,smell,of,smoke,to,her,<END>
she,fled,up,the,stairs,to,her,own,room,and,hung,out,the,window,for,a,better,view,<END>
the,sky,was,a,hideous,lurid,color,and,great,swirls,of,black,smoke,went,twisting,up,to,hand,in,billowy,clouds,above,the,flames,<END>
the,smell,of,smoke,was,stronger,now,<END>
her,mind,rushed,incoherently,here,and,there,thinking,how,soon,the,flames,would,spread,up,peachtree,street,and,burn,this,house,how,soon,the,yankees,would,be,rushing,in,upon,her,where,she,would,run,what,she,would,do,<END>
all,the,fiends,of,hell,seemed,screaming,in,her,ears,and,her,brain,swirled,with,confusion,and,panic,so,overpowering,she,clung,to,the,window,sill,for,support,<END>
i,must,think,she,told,herself,over,and,over,<END>
i,must,think,<END>
but,thoughts,eluded,her,darting,in,and,out,of,her,mind,like,frightened,humming,birds,<END>
as,she,stood,hanging,to,the,sill,a,deafening,explosion,burst,on,her,ears,louder,than,any,cannon,she,had,ever,heard,<END>
the,sky,was,rent,with,gigantic,flame,<END>
then,other,explosions,<END>
the,earth,shook,and,the,glass,in,the,panes,above,her,head,shivered,and,came,down,around,her,<END>
the,world,became,an,inferno,of,noise,and,flame,and,trembling,earth,as,one,explosion,followed,another,in,earsplitting,succession,<END>
torrents,of,sparks,shot,to,the,sky,and,descended,slowly,lazily,through,blood-colored,clouds,of,smoke,<END>
she,thought,she,heard,a,feeble,call,from,the,next,room,but,she,paid,it,no,heed,<END>
she,had,no,time,for,melanie,now,<END>
no,time,for,anything,except,a,fear,that,licked,through,her,veins,as,swiftly,as,the,flames,she,saw,<END>
she,was,a,child,and,mad,with,fright,and,she,wanted,to,bury,her,head,in,her,mother's,lap,and,shut,out,this,sight,<END>
if,she,were,only,home,<END>
home,with,mother,<END>
through,the,nerve-shivering,sounds,she,heard,another,sound,that,of,fear-sped,feet,coming,up,the,stairs,three,at,a,time,heard,a,voice,yelping,like,a,lost,hound,<END>
prissy,broke,into,the,room,and,flying,to,scarlett,clutched,her,arm,in,a,grip,that,seemed,to,pinch,out,pieces,of,flesh,<END>

scarlett,knew,she,should,go,in,and,quiet,melanie's,fear,knew,melanie,must,be,frightened,out,of,her,senses,by,the,thunderous,noises,that,continued,unabated,and,the,glare,that,lighted,the,sky,<END>
it,looked,and,sounded,like,the,end,of,the,world,<END>
but,she,could,not,bring,herself,to,go,back,into,that,room,just,yet,<END>
she,ran,down,the,stairs,with,some,idea,of,packing,up,miss,pittypat's,china,and,the,little,silver,she,had,left,when,she,refugeed,to,macon,<END>
but,when,she,reached,the,dining,room,her,hands,were,shaking,so,badly,she,dropped,three,plates,and,shattered,them,<END>
she,ran,out,onto,the,porch,to,listen,and,back,again,to,the,dining,room,and,dropped,the,silver,clattering,to,the,floor,<END>
everything,she,touched,she,dropped,<END>
in,her,hurry,she,slipped,on,the,rag,rug,and,fell,to,the,floor,with,a,jolt,but,leaped,up,so,quickly,she,was,not,even,aware,of,the,pain,<END>
upstairs,she,could,hear,prissy,galloping,about,like,a,wild,animal,and,the,sound,maddened,her,for,she,was,galloping,just,as,aimlessly,<END>
for,the,dozenth,time,she,ran,out,onto,the,porch,but,this,time,she,did,not,go,back,to,her,futile,packing,<END>
she,sat,down,<END>
it,was,just,impossible,to,pack,anything,<END>
impossible,to,do,anything,but,sit,with,hammering,heart,and,wait,for,rhett,<END>
it,seemed,hours,before,he,came,<END>
at,last,far,up,the,road,she,heard,the,protesting,screech,of,unoiled,axles,and,the,slow,uncertain,plodding,of,hooves,<END>
why,didn't,he,hurry,<END>
why,didn't,he,make,the,horse,trot,<END>
the,sounds,came,nearer,and,she,leaped,to,her,feet,and,called,rhett's,name,<END>
then,she,saw,him,dimly,as,he,climbed,down,from,the,seat,of,a,small,wagon,heard,the,clicking,of,the,gate,as,he,came,toward,her,<END>
he,came,into,view,and,the,light,of,the,lamp,showed,him,plainly,<END>
his,dress,was,as,debonaire,as,if,he,were,going,to,a,ball,well-tailored,white,linen,coat,and,trousers,embroidered,gray,watered-silk,waistcoat,and,a,hint,of,ruffle,on,his,shirt,bosom,<END>
his,wide,panama,hat,was,set,dashingly,on,one,side,of,his,head,and,in,the,belt,of,his,trousers,were,thrust,two,ivory-handled,long-,barreled,dueling,pistols,<END>
the,pockets,of,his,coat,sagged,heavily,with,ammunition,<END>
he,came,up,the,walk,with,the,springy,stride,of,a,savage,and,his,fine,head,was,carried,like,a,pagan,prince,<END>
the,dangers,of,the,night,which,had,driven,scarlett,into,panic,had,affected,him,like,an,intoxicant,<END>
there,was,a,carefully,restrained,ferocity,in,his,dark,face,a,ruthlessness,which,would,have,frightened,her,had,she,the,wits,to,see,it,<END>
his,black,eyes,danced,as,though,amused,by,the,whole,affair,as,though,the,earth-splitting,sounds,and,the,horrid,glare,were,merely,things,to,frighten,children,<END>
she,swayed,toward,him,as,he,came,up,the,steps,her,face,white,her,green,eyes,burning,<END>

yes,i,am,<END>
i'm,frightened,to,death,and,if,you,had,the,sense,god,gave,a,goat,you'd,be,frightened,too,<END>

we,must,get,out,of,here,<END>
at,your,service,madam,<END>

i,made,the,trip,out,here,for,curiosity,just,to,see,where,you,were,intending,to,go,<END>
you,can't,go,north,or,east,or,south,or,west,<END>
the,yankees,are,all,around,<END>
there's,just,one,road,out,of,town,which,the,yankees,haven't,got,yet,and,the,army,is,retreating,by,that,road,<END>
and,that,road,won't,be,open,long,<END>
general,steve,lee's,cavalry,is,fighting,a,rear-guard,action,at,rough,and,ready,to,hold,it,open,long,enough,for,the,army,to,get,away,<END>
if,you,follow,the,army,down,the,mcdonough,road,they'll,take,the,horse,away,from,you,and,while,it's,not,much,of,a,horse,i,did,go,to,a,lot,of,trouble,stealing,it,<END>
just,where,are,you,going,<END>
she,stood,shaking,listening,to,his,words,hardly,hearing,them,<END>
but,at,his,question,she,suddenly,knew,where,she,was,going,knew,that,all,this,miserable,day,she,had,known,where,she,was,going,<END>
the,only,place,<END>
i'm,going,home,she,said,<END>

the,yankees,may,be,all,over,tara,by,now,all,over,the,county,<END>
nobody,knows,where,they,are,but,they're,in,that,neighborhood,<END>
you,can't,go,home,<END>
you,can't,go,right,through,the,yankee,army,<END>
i,will,go,home,<END>
she,cried,<END>
i,will,<END>
i,will,<END>
you,little,fool,and,his,voice,was,swift,and,rough,<END>
you,can't,go,that,way,<END>
even,if,you,didn't,run,into,the,yankees,the,woods,are,full,of,stragglers,and,deserters,from,both,armies,<END>
and,lots,of,our,troops,are,still,retreating,from,jonesboro,<END>
they'd,take,the,horse,away,from,you,as,quickly,as,the,yankees,would,<END>
your,only,chance,is,to,follow,the,troops,down,the,mcdonough,road,and,pray,that,they,won't,see,you,in,the,dark,<END>
you,can't,go,to,tara,<END>
even,if,you,got,there,you'd,probably,find,it,burned,down,<END>
i,won't,let,you,go,home,<END>
it's,insanity,<END>
i,will,go,home,<END>
she,cried,and,her,voice,broke,and,rose,to,a,scream,<END>
i,will,go,home,<END>
you,can't,stop,me,<END>
i,will,go,home,<END>
i,want,my,mother,<END>
i'll,kill,you,if,you,try,to,stop,me,<END>
i,will,go,home,<END>
tears,of,fright,and,hysteria,streamed,down,her,face,as,she,finally,gave,way,under,the,long,strain,<END>
she,beat,on,his,chest,with,her,fists,and,screamed,again,i,will,<END>
i,will,<END>
if,i,have,to,walk,every,step,of,the,way,<END>
suddenly,she,was,in,his,arms,her,wet,cheek,against,the,starched,ruffle,of,his,shirt,her,beating,hands,stilled,against,him,<END>
his,hands,caressed,her,tumbled,hair,gently,soothingly,and,his,voice,was,gentle,too,<END>
so,gentle,so,quiet,so,devoid,of,mockery,it,did,not,seem,rhett,butler's,voice,at,all,but,the,voice,of,some,kind,strong,stranger,who,smelled,of,brandy,and,tobacco,and,horses,comforting,smells,because,they,reminded,her,of,gerald,<END>
there,there,darling,he,said,softly,<END>
don't,cry,<END>
you,shall,go,home,my,brave,little,girl,<END>
you,shall,go,home,<END>
don't,cry,<END>
she,felt,something,brush,her,hair,and,wondered,vaguely,through,her,tumult,if,it,were,his,lips,<END>
he,was,so,tender,so,infinitely,soothing,she,longed,to,stay,in,his,arms,forever,<END>
with,such,strong,arms,about,her,surely,nothing,could,harm,her,<END>
he,fumbled,in,his,pocket,and,produced,a,handkerchief,and,wiped,her,eyes,<END>
now,blow,your,nose,like,a,good,child,he,ordered,a,glint,of,a,smile,in,his,eyes,and,tell,me,what,to,do,<END>
we,must,work,fast,<END>
she,blew,her,nose,obediently,still,trembling,but,she,could,not,think,what,to,tell,him,to,do,<END>
seeing,how,her,lip,quivered,and,her,eyes,looked,up,at,him,helplessly,he,took,command,<END>
mrs,wilkes,has,had,her,child,<END>
it,will,be,dangerous,to,move,her,dangerous,to,drive,her,twenty-five,miles,in,that,rickety,wagon,<END>
we'd,better,leave,her,with,mrs,<END>
meade,<END>
the,meades,aren't,home,<END>
i,can't,leave,her,<END>
very,well,<END>
into,the,wagon,she,goes,<END>
where,is,that,simple-minded,little,wench,<END>
upstairs,packing,the,trunk,<END>
trunk,<END>
you,can't,take,any,trunk,in,that,wagon,<END>
it's,almost,too,small,to,hold,all,of,you,and,the,wheels,are,ready,to,come,off,with,no,encouragement,<END>
call,her,and,tell,her,to,get,the,smallest,feather,bed,in,the,house,and,put,it,in,the,wagon,<END>
still,scarlett,could,not,move,<END>
he,took,her,arm,in,a,strong,grasp,and,some,of,the,vitality,which,animated,him,seemed,to,flow,into,her,body,<END>
if,only,she,could,be,as,cool,and,casual,as,he,was,<END>
he,propelled,her,into,the,hall,but,she,still,stood,helplessly,looking,at,him,<END>
his,lip,went,down,mockingly,can,this,be,the,heroic,young,woman,who,assured,me,she,feared,neither,god,nor,man,<END>
he,suddenly,burst,into,laughter,and,dropped,her,arm,<END>
stung,she,glared,at,him,hating,him,<END>
i'm,not,afraid,she,said,<END>
yes,you,are,<END>
in,another,moment,you'll,be,in,a,swoon,and,i,have,no,smelling,salts,about,me,<END>
she,stamped,her,foot,impotently,because,she,could,not,think,of,anything,else,to,do,and,without,a,word,picked,up,the,lamp,and,started,up,the,stairs,<END>
he,was,close,behind,her,and,she,could,hear,him,laughing,softly,to,himself,<END>
that,sound,stiffened,her,spine,<END>
she,went,into,wade's,nursery,and,found,him,sitting,clutched,in,prissy's,arms,half,dressed,hiccoughing,quietly,<END>
prissy,was,whimpering,<END>
the,feather,tick,on,wade's,bed,was,small,and,she,ordered,prissy,to,drag,it,down,the,stairs,and,into,the,wagon,<END>
prissy,put,down,the,child,and,obeyed,<END>
wade,followed,her,down,the,stairs,his,hiccoughs,stilled,by,his,interest,in,the,proceedings,<END>
come,said,scarlett,turning,to,melanie's,door,and,rhett,followed,her,hat,in,hand,<END>
melanie,lay,quietly,with,the,sheet,up,to,her,chin,<END>
her,face,was,deathly,white,but,her,eyes,sunken,and,black,circled,were,serene,<END>
she,showed,no,surprise,at,the,sight,of,rhett,in,her,bedroom,but,seemed,to,take,it,as,a,matter,of,course,<END>
she,tried,to,smile,weakly,but,the,smile,died,before,it,reached,the,corners,of,her,mouth,<END>
we,are,going,home,to,tara,scarlett,explained,rapidly,<END>
the,yankees,are,coming,<END>
rhett,is,going,to,take,us,<END>
it's,the,only,way,melly,<END>
melanie,tried,to,nod,her,head,feebly,and,gestured,toward,the,baby,<END>
scarlett,picked,up,the,small,baby,and,wrapped,him,hastily,in,a,thick,towel,<END>
rhett,stepped,to,the,bed,<END>
i'll,try,not,to,hurt,you,he,said,quietly,tucking,the,sheet,about,her,<END>
see,if,you,can,put,your,arms,around,my,neck,<END>
melanie,tried,but,they,fell,back,weakly,<END>
he,bent,slipped,an,arm,under,her,shoulders,and,another,across,her,knees,and,lifted,her,gently,<END>
she,did,not,cry,out,but,scarlett,saw,her,bite,her,lip,and,go,even,whiter,<END>
scarlett,held,the,lamp,high,for,rhett,to,see,and,started,toward,the,door,when,melanie,made,a,feeble,gesture,toward,the,wall,<END>
what,is,it,<END>
rhett,asked,softly,<END>
please,melanie,whispered,trying,to,point,<END>
charles,<END>
rhett,looked,down,at,her,as,if,he,thought,her,delirious,but,scarlett,understood,and,was,irritated,<END>
she,knew,melanie,wanted,the,daguerreotype,of,charles,which,hung,on,the,wall,below,his,sword,and,pistol,<END>
please,melanie,whispered,again,the,sword,<END>
oh,all,right,said,scarlett,and,after,she,had,lighted,rhett's,careful,way,down,the,steps,she,went,back,and,unhooked,the,sword,and,pistol,belts,<END>
it,would,be,awkward,carrying,them,as,well,as,the,baby,and,the,lamp,<END>
that,was,just,like,melanie,not,to,be,at,all,bothered,over,nearly,dying,and,having,the,yankees,at,her,heels,but,to,worry,about,charles',things,<END>
as,she,took,down,the,daguerreotype,she,caught,a,glimpse,of,charles',face,<END>
his,large,brown,eyes,met,hers,and,she,stopped,for,a,moment,to,look,at,the,picture,curiously,<END>
this,man,had,been,her,husband,had,lain,beside,her,for,a,few,nights,had,given,her,a,child,with,eyes,as,soft,and,brown,as,his,<END>
and,she,could,hardly,remember,him,<END>
the,child,in,her,arms,waved,small,fists,and,mewed,softly,and,she,looked,down,at,him,<END>
for,the,first,time,she,realized,that,this,was,ashley's,baby,and,suddenly,wished,with,all,the,strength,left,in,her,that,he,were,her,baby,hers,and,ashley's,<END>
prissy,came,bounding,up,the,stairs,and,scarlett,handed,the,child,to,her,<END>
they,went,hastily,down,the,lamp,throwing,uncertain,shadows,on,the,wall,<END>
in,the,hall,scarlett,saw,a,bonnet,and,put,it,on,hurriedly,tying,the,ribbons,under,her,chin,<END>
it,was,melanie's,black,mourning,bonnet,and,it,did,not,fit,scarlett's,head,but,she,could,not,recall,where,she,had,put,her,own,bonnet,<END>
she,went,out,of,the,house,and,down,the,front,steps,carrying,the,lamp,and,trying,to,keep,the,saber,from,banging,against,her,legs,<END>
melanie,lay,full,length,in,the,back,of,the,wagon,and,beside,her,were,wade,and,the,towel-swathed,baby,<END>
prissy,climbed,in,and,took,the,baby,in,her,arms,<END>
the,wagon,was,very,small,and,the,boards,about,the,sides,very,low,<END>
the,wheels,leaned,inward,as,if,their,first,revolution,would,make,them,come,off,<END>
she,took,one,look,at,the,horse,and,her,heart,sank,<END>
he,was,a,small,emaciated,animal,and,he,stood,with,his,head,dispiritedly,low,almost,between,his,forelegs,<END>
his,back,was,raw,with,sores,and,harness,galls,and,he,breathed,as,no,sound,horse,should,<END>
not,much,of,an,animal,is,it,<END>
grinned,rhett,<END>
looks,like,he'll,die,in,the,shafts,<END>
but,he's,the,best,i,could,do,<END>
some,day,i'll,tell,you,with,embellishments,just,where,and,how,i,stole,him,and,how,narrowly,i,missed,getting,shot,<END>
nothing,but,my,devotion,to,you,would,make,me,at,this,stage,of,my,career,turn,horse,thief,and,thief,of,such,a,horse,<END>
let,me,help,you,in,<END>
he,took,the,lamp,from,her,and,set,it,on,the,ground,<END>
the,front,seat,was,only,a,narrow,plank,across,the,sides,of,the,wagon,<END>
rhett,picked,scarlett,up,bodily,and,swung,her,to,it,<END>
how,wonderful,to,be,a,man,and,as,strong,as,rhett,she,thought,tucking,her,wide,skirts,about,her,<END>
with,rhett,beside,her,she,did,not,fear,anything,neither,the,fire,nor,the,noise,nor,the,yankees,<END>
he,climbed,onto,the,seat,beside,her,and,picked,up,the,reins,<END>
oh,wait,<END>
she,cried,<END>
i,forgot,to,lock,the,front,door,<END>
he,burst,into,a,roar,of,laughter,and,slapped,the,reins,upon,the,horse's,back,<END>
what,are,you,laughing,at,<END>
at,you,locking,the,yankees,out,he,said,and,the,horse,started,off,slowly,reluctantly,<END>
the,lamp,on,the,sidewalk,burned,on,making,a,tiny,yellow,circle,of,light,which,grew,smaller,and,smaller,as,they,moved,away,<END>
rhett,turned,the,horse's,slow,feet,westward,from,peachtree,and,the,wobbling,wagon,jounced,into,the,rutty,lane,with,a,violence,that,wrenched,an,abruptly,stifled,moan,from,melanie,<END>
dark,trees,interlaced,above,their,heads,dark,silent,houses,loomed,up,on,either,side,and,the,white,palings,of,fences,gleamed,faintly,like,a,row,of,tombstones,<END>
the,narrow,street,was,a,dim,tunnel,but,faintly,through,the,thick,leafy,ceiling,the,hideous,red,glow,of,the,sky,penetrated,and,shadows,chased,one,another,down,the,dark,way,like,mad,ghosts,<END>
the,smell,of,smoke,came,stronger,and,stronger,and,on,the,wings,of,the,hot,breeze,came,a,pandemonium,of,sound,from,the,center,of,town,yells,the,dull,rumbling,of,heavy,army,wagons,and,the,steady,tramp,of,marching,feet,<END>
as,rhett,jerked,the,horse's,head,and,turned,him,into,another,street,another,deafening,explosion,tore,the,air,and,a,monstrous,skyrocket,of,flame,and,smoke,shot,up,in,the,west,<END>
that,must,be,the,last,of,the,ammunition,trains,rhett,said,calmly,<END>
why,didn't,they,get,them,out,this,morning,the,fools,<END>
there,was,plenty,of,time,<END>
well,too,bad,for,us,<END>
i,thought,by,circling,around,the,center,of,town,we,might,avoid,the,fire,and,that,drunken,mob,on,decatur,street,and,get,through,to,the,southwest,part,of,town,without,any,danger,<END>
but,we've,got,to,cross,marietta,street,somewhere,and,that,explosion,was,near,marietta,street,or,i,miss,my,guess,<END>
must,must,we,go,through,the,fire,<END>
scarlett,quavered,<END>
not,if,we,hurry,said,rhett,and,springing,from,the,wagon,he,disappeared,into,the,darkness,of,a,yard,<END>
when,he,returned,he,had,a,small,limb,of,a,tree,in,his,hand,and,he,laid,it,mercilessly,across,the,horse's,galled,back,<END>
the,animal,broke,into,a,shambling,trot,his,breath,panting,and,labored,and,the,wagon,swayed,forward,with,a,jolt,that,threw,them,about,like,popcorn,in,a,popper,<END>
the,baby,wailed,and,prissy,and,wade,cried,out,as,they,bruised,themselves,against,the,sides,of,the,wagon,<END>
but,from,melanie,there,was,no,sound,<END>
as,they,neared,marietta,street,the,trees,thinned,out,and,the,tall,flames,roaring,up,above,the,buildings,threw,street,and,houses,into,a,glare,of,light,brighter,than,day,casting,monstrous,shadows,that,twisted,as,wildly,as,torn,sails,flapping,in,a,gale,on,a,sinking,ship,<END>
scarlett's,teeth,chattered,but,so,great,was,her,terror,she,was,not,even,aware,of,it,<END>
she,was,cold,and,she,shivered,even,though,the,heat,of,the,flames,was,already,hot,against,their,faces,<END>
this,was,hell,and,she,was,in,it,and,if,she,could,only,have,conquered,her,shaking,knees,she,would,have,leaped,from,the,wagon,and,run,screaming,back,the,dark,road,they,had,come,back,to,the,refuge,of,miss,pittypat's,house,<END>
she,shrank,closer,to,rhett,took,his,arm,in,fingers,that,trembled,and,looked,up,at,him,for,words,for,comfort,for,something,reassuring,<END>
in,the,unholy,crimson,glow,that,bathed,them,his,dark,profile,stood,out,as,clearly,as,the,head,on,an,ancient,coin,beautiful,cruel,and,decadent,<END>
at,her,touch,he,turned,to,her,his,eyes,gleaming,with,a,light,as,frightening,as,the,fire,<END>
to,scarlett,he,seemed,as,exhilarated,and,contemptuous,as,if,he,got,strong,pleasure,from,the,situation,as,if,he,welcomed,the,inferno,they,were,approaching,<END>
here,he,said,laying,a,hand,on,one,of,the,long-barreled,pistols,in,his,belt,<END>
if,anyone,black,or,white,comes,up,on,your,side,of,the,wagon,and,tries,to,lay,hand,on,the,horse,shoot,him,and,we'll,ask,questions,later,<END>
but,for,god's,sake,don't,shoot,the,nag,in,your,excitement,<END>
i,i,have,a,pistol,she,whispered,clutching,the,weapon,in,her,lap,perfectly,certain,that,if,death,stared,her,in,the,face,she,would,be,too,frightened,to,pull,the,trigger,<END>
you,have,<END>
where,did,you,get,it,<END>
it's,charles',<END>
charles,<END>
yes,charles,my,husband,<END>
did,you,ever,really,have,a,husband,my,dear,<END>
he,whispered,and,laughed,softly,<END>
if,he,would,only,be,serious,<END>
if,he,would,only,hurry,<END>
how,do,you,suppose,i,got,my,boy,<END>
she,cried,fiercely,<END>
oh,there,are,other,ways,than,husbands,<END>
will,you,hush,and,hurry,<END>
but,he,drew,rein,abruptly,almost,at,marietta,street,in,the,shadow,of,a,warehouse,not,yet,touched,by,the,flames,<END>
hurry,<END>
it,was,the,only,word,in,her,mind,<END>
hurry,<END>

soldiers,he,said,<END>
the,detachment,came,down,marietta,street,between,the,burning,buildings,walking,at,route,step,tiredly,rifles,held,any,way,heads,down,too,weary,to,hurry,too,weary,to,care,if,timbers,were,crashing,to,right,and,left,and,smoke,billowing,about,them,<END>
they,were,all,ragged,so,ragged,that,between,officers,and,men,there,were,no,distinguishing,insignia,except,here,and,there,a,torn,hat,brim,pinned,up,with,a,wreathed,c,s,a,<END>
many,were,barefooted,and,here,and,there,a,dirty,bandage,wrapped,a,head,or,arm,<END>
they,went,past,looking,neither,to,left,nor,right,so,silent,that,had,it,not,been,for,the,steady,tramp,of,feet,they,might,all,have,been,ghosts,<END>
take,a,good,look,at,them,came,rhett's,gibing,voice,so,you,can,tell,your,grandchildren,you,saw,the,rear,guard,of,the,glorious,cause,in,retreat,<END>
suddenly,she,hated,him,hated,him,with,a,strength,that,momentarily,overpowered,her,fear,made,it,seem,petty,and,small,<END>
she,knew,her,safety,and,that,of,the,others,in,the,back,of,the,wagon,depended,on,him,and,him,alone,but,she,hated,him,for,his,sneering,at,those,ragged,ranks,<END>
she,thought,of,charles,who,was,dead,and,ashley,who,might,be,dead,and,all,the,gay,and,gallant,young,men,who,were,rotting,in,shallow,graves,and,she,forgot,that,she,too,had,once,thought,them,fools,<END>
she,could,not,speak,but,hatred,and,disgust,burned,in,her,eyes,as,she,stared,at,him,fiercely,<END>
as,the,last,of,the,soldiers,were,passing,a,small,figure,in,the,rear,rank,his,rifle,butt,dragging,the,ground,wavered,stopped,and,stared,after,the,others,with,a,dirty,face,so,dulled,by,fatigue,he,looked,like,a,sleepwalker,<END>
he,was,as,small,as,scarlett,so,small,his,rifle,was,almost,as,tall,as,he,was,and,his,grime-smeared,face,was,unbearded,<END>
sixteen,at,the,most,thought,scarlett,irrelevantly,must,be,one,of,the,home,guard,or,a,runaway,schoolboy,<END>
as,she,watched,the,boy's,knees,buckled,slowly,and,he,went,down,in,the,dust,<END>
without,a,word,two,men,fell,out,of,the,last,rank,and,walked,back,to,him,<END>
one,a,tall,spare,man,with,a,black,beard,that,hung,to,his,belt,silently,handed,his,own,rifle,and,that,of,the,boy,to,the,other,<END>
then,stooping,he,jerked,the,boy,to,his,shoulders,with,an,ease,that,looked,like,sleight,of,hand,<END>
he,started,off,slowly,after,the,retreating,column,his,shoulders,bowed,under,the,weight,while,the,boy,weak,infuriated,like,a,child,teased,by,its,elders,screamed,out,put,me,down,damn,you,<END>

the,bearded,man,said,nothing,and,plodded,on,out,of,sight,around,the,bend,of,the,road,<END>
rhett,sat,still,the,reins,lax,in,his,hands,looking,after,them,a,curious,moody,look,on,his,swarthy,face,<END>
then,there,was,a,crash,of,falling,timbers,near,by,and,scarlett,saw,a,thin,tongue,of,flame,lick,up,over,the,roof,of,the,warehouse,in,whose,sheltering,shadow,they,sat,<END>
then,pennons,and,battle,flags,of,flame,flared,triumphantly,to,the,sky,above,them,<END>

rhett,made,no,reply,but,brought,the,tree,limb,down,on,the,horse's,back,with,a,cruel,force,that,made,the,animal,leap,forward,<END>
with,all,the,speed,the,horse,could,summon,they,jolted,and,bounced,across,marietta,street,<END>
ahead,of,them,was,a,tunnel,of,fire,where,buildings,were,blazing,on,either,side,of,the,short,narrow,street,that,led,down,to,the,railroad,tracks,<END>
they,plunged,into,it,<END>
a,glare,brighter,than,a,dozen,suns,dazzled,their,eyes,scorching,heat,seared,their,skins,and,the,roaring,cracking,and,crashing,beat,upon,their,ears,in,painful,waves,<END>
for,an,eternity,it,seemed,they,were,in,the,midst,of,flaming,torment,and,then,abruptly,they,were,in,semidarkness,again,<END>
as,they,dashed,down,the,street,and,bumped,over,the,railroad,tracks,rhett,applied,the,whip,automatically,<END>
his,face,looked,set,and,absent,as,though,he,had,forgotten,where,he,was,<END>
his,broad,shoulders,were,hunched,forward,and,his,chin,jutted,out,as,though,the,thoughts,in,his,mind,were,not,pleasant,<END>
the,heat,of,the,fire,made,sweat,stream,down,his,forehead,and,cheeks,but,he,did,not,wipe,it,off,<END>
they,pulled,into,a,side,street,then,another,then,turned,and,twisted,from,one,narrow,street,to,another,until,scarlett,completely,lost,her,bearings,and,the,roaring,of,the,flames,died,behind,them,<END>
still,rhett,did,not,speak,<END>
he,only,laid,on,the,whip,with,regularity,<END>
the,red,glow,in,the,sky,was,fading,now,and,the,road,became,so,dark,so,frightening,scarlett,would,have,welcomed,words,any,words,from,him,even,jeering,insulting,words,words,that,cut,<END>
but,he,did,not,speak,<END>
silent,or,not,she,thanked,heaven,for,the,comfort,of,his,presence,<END>
it,was,so,good,to,have,a,man,beside,her,to,lean,close,to,him,and,feel,the,hard,swell,of,his,arm,and,know,that,he,stood,between,her,and,unnamable,terrors,even,though,he,merely,sat,there,and,stared,<END>
oh,rhett,she,whispered,clasping,his,arm,what,would,we,ever,have,done,without,you,<END>
i'm,so,glad,you,aren't,in,the,army,<END>
he,turned,his,head,and,gave,her,one,look,a,look,that,made,her,drop,his,arm,and,shrink,back,<END>
there,was,no,mockery,in,his,eyes,now,<END>
they,were,naked,and,there,was,anger,and,something,like,bewilderment,in,them,<END>
his,lip,curled,down,and,he,turned,his,head,away,<END>
for,a,long,time,they,jounced,along,in,a,silence,unbroken,except,for,the,faint,wails,of,the,baby,and,sniffles,from,prissy,<END>
when,she,was,able,to,bear,the,sniffling,noise,no,longer,scarlett,turned,and,pinched,her,viciously,causing,prissy,to,scream,in,good,earnest,before,she,relapsed,into,frightened,silence,<END>
finally,rhett,turned,the,horse,at,right,angles,and,after,a,while,they,were,on,a,wider,smoother,road,<END>
the,dim,shapes,of,houses,grew,farther,and,farther,apart,and,unbroken,woods,loomed,wall-like,on,either,side,<END>

hurry,<END>
don't,stop,<END>
let,the,animal,breathe,a,bit,<END>
then,turning,to,her,he,asked,slowly,scarlett,are,you,still,determined,to,do,this,crazy,thing,<END>

do,you,still,want,to,try,to,get,through,to,tara,<END>
it's,suicidal,<END>

the,horse,isn't,tired,<END>
just,a,minute,<END>
you,can't,go,down,to,jonesboro,on,this,road,<END>
you,can't,follow,the,train,tracks,<END>
they've,been,fighting,up,and,down,there,all,day,from,rough,and,ready,on,south,<END>
do,you,know,any,other,roads,small,wagon,roads,or,lanes,that,don't,go,through,rough,and,ready,or,jonesboro,<END>
oh,yes,cried,scarlett,in,relief,<END>
if,we,can,just,get,near,to,rough,and,ready,i,know,a,wagon,trace,that,winds,off,from,the,main,jonesboro,road,and,wanders,around,for,miles,<END>

it,comes,out,right,near,the,macintosh,place,and,that's,only,a,mile,from,tara,<END>

maybe,you,can,get,past,rough,and,ready,all,right,<END>
general,steve,lee,was,there,during,the,afternoon,covering,the,retreat,<END>

_i_,can,get,through,<END>
yes,you,<END>
his,voice,was,rough,<END>
but,rhett,you,aren't,going,to,take,us,<END>
no,<END>
i'm,leaving,you,here,<END>
she,looked,around,wildly,at,the,livid,sky,behind,them,at,the,dark,trees,on,either,hand,hemming,them,in,like,a,prison,wall,at,the,frightened,figures,in,the,back,of,the,wagon,and,finally,at,him,<END>
had,she,gone,crazy,<END>
was,she,not,hearing,right,<END>
he,was,grinning,now,<END>
she,could,just,see,his,white,teeth,in,the,faint,light,and,the,old,mockery,was,back,in,his,eyes,<END>
leaving,us,<END>
where,where,are,you,going,<END>
i,am,going,dear,girl,with,the,army,<END>
she,sighed,with,relief,and,irritation,<END>
why,did,he,joke,at,this,time,of,all,times,<END>
rhett,in,the,army,<END>
after,all,he'd,said,about,stupid,fools,who,were,enticed,into,losing,their,lives,by,a,roll,of,drums,and,brave,words,from,orators,fools,who,killed,themselves,that,wise,men,might,make,money,<END>
oh,i,could,choke,you,for,scaring,me,so,<END>
let's,get,on,<END>
i'm,not,joking,my,dear,<END>
and,i,am,hurt,scarlett,that,you,do,not,take,my,gallant,sacrifice,with,better,spirit,<END>
where,is,your,patriotism,your,love,for,our,glorious,cause,<END>
now,is,your,chance,to,tell,me,to,return,with,my,shield,or,on,it,<END>
but,talk,fast,for,i,want,time,to,make,a,brave,speech,before,departing,for,the,wars,<END>
his,drawling,voice,gibed,in,her,ears,<END>
he,was,jeering,at,her,and,somehow,she,knew,he,was,jeering,at,himself,too,<END>
what,was,he,talking,about,<END>
patriotism,shields,brave,speeches,<END>
it,wasn't,possible,that,he,meant,what,he,was,saying,<END>
it,just,wasn't,believable,that,he,could,talk,so,blithely,of,leaving,her,here,on,this,dark,road,with,a,woman,who,might,be,dying,a,new-born,infant,a,foolish,black,wench,and,a,frightened,child,leaving,her,to,pilot,them,through,miles,of,battle,fields,and,stragglers,and,yankees,and,fire,and,god,knows,what,<END>
once,when,she,was,six,years,old,she,had,fallen,from,a,tree,flat,on,her,stomach,<END>
she,could,still,recall,that,sickening,interval,before,breath,came,back,into,her,body,<END>
now,as,she,looked,at,rhett,she,felt,the,same,way,she,had,felt,then,breathless,stunned,nauseated,<END>
rhett,you,are,joking,<END>
she,grabbed,his,arm,and,felt,her,tears,of,fright,splash,down,her,wrist,<END>
he,raised,her,hand,and,kissed,it,arily,<END>
selfish,to,the,end,aren't,you,my,dear,<END>
thinking,only,of,your,own,precious,hide,and,not,of,the,gallant,confederacy,<END>
think,how,our,troops,will,be,heartened,by,my,eleventh-hour,appearance,<END>
there,was,a,malicious,tenderness,in,his,voice,<END>
oh,rhett,she,wailed,how,can,you,do,this,to,me,<END>
why,are,you,leaving,me,<END>
why,<END>
he,laughed,jauntily,<END>
because,perhaps,of,the,betraying,sentimentality,that,lurks,in,all,of,us,southerners,<END>
perhaps,perhaps,because,i,am,ashamed,<END>
who,knows,<END>
ashamed,<END>
you,should,die,of,shame,<END>
to,desert,us,here,alone,helpless,<END>
dear,scarlett,<END>
you,aren't,helpless,<END>
anyone,as,selfish,and,determined,as,you,are,is,never,helpless,<END>
god,help,the,yankees,if,they,should,get,you,<END>
he,stepped,abruptly,down,from,the,wagon,and,as,she,watched,him,stunned,with,bewilderment,he,came,around,to,her,side,of,the,wagon,<END>
get,out,he,ordered,<END>
she,stared,at,him,<END>
he,reached,up,roughly,caught,her,under,the,arms,and,swung,her,to,the,ground,beside,him,<END>
with,a,tight,grip,on,her,he,dragged,her,several,paces,away,from,the,wagon,<END>
she,felt,the,dust,and,gravel,in,her,slippers,hurting,her,feet,<END>
the,still,hot,darkness,wrapped,her,like,a,dream,<END>
i'm,not,asking,you,to,understand,or,forgive,<END>
i,don't,give,a,damn,whether,you,do,either,for,i,shall,never,understand,or,forgive,myself,for,this,idiocy,<END>
i,am,annoyed,at,myself,to,find,that,so,much,quixoticism,still,lingers,in,me,<END>
but,our,fair,southland,needs,every,man,<END>
didn't,our,brave,governor,brown,say,just,that,<END>
not,matter,<END>
i'm,off,to,the,wars,<END>
he,laughed,suddenly,a,ringing,free,laugh,that,startled,the,echoes,in,the,dark,woods,<END>
'i,could,not,love,thee,dear,so,much,loved,i,not,honour,more,',<END>
that's,a,pat,speech,isn't,it,<END>
certainly,better,than,anything,i,can,think,up,myself,at,the,present,moment,<END>
for,i,do,love,you,scarlett,in,spite,of,what,i,said,that,night,on,the,porch,last,month,<END>
his,drawl,was,caressing,and,his,hands,slid,up,her,bare,arms,warm,strong,hands,<END>
i,love,you,scarlett,because,we,are,so,much,alike,renegades,both,of,us,dear,and,selfish,rascals,<END>
neither,of,us,cares,a,rap,if,the,whole,world,goes,to,pot,so,long,as,we,are,safe,and,comfortable,<END>
his,voice,went,on,in,the,darkness,and,she,heard,words,but,they,made,no,sense,to,her,<END>
her,mind,was,tiredly,trying,to,take,in,the,harsh,truth,that,he,was,leaving,her,here,to,face,the,yankees,alone,<END>
her,mind,said,he's,leaving,me,<END>
he's,leaving,me,<END>
but,no,emotion,stirred,<END>
then,his,arms,went,around,her,waist,and,shoulders,and,she,felt,the,hard,muscles,of,his,thighs,against,her,body,and,the,buttons,of,his,coat,pressing,into,her,breast,<END>
a,warm,tide,of,feeling,bewildering,frightening,swept,over,her,carrying,out,of,her,mind,the,time,and,place,and,circumstances,<END>
she,felt,as,limp,as,a,rag,doll,warm,weak,and,helpless,and,his,supporting,arms,were,so,pleasant,<END>
you,don't,want,to,change,your,mind,about,what,i,said,last,month,<END>
there's,nothing,like,danger,and,death,to,give,an,added,fillip,<END>
be,patriotic,scarlett,<END>
think,how,you,would,be,sending,a,soldier,to,his,death,with,beautiful,memories,<END>
he,was,kissing,her,now,and,his,mustache,tickled,her,mouth,kissing,her,with,slow,hot,lips,that,were,so,leisurely,as,though,he,had,the,whole,night,before,him,<END>
charles,had,never,kissed,her,like,this,<END>
never,had,the,kisses,of,the,tarleton,and,calvert,boys,made,her,go,hot,and,cold,and,shaky,like,this,<END>
he,bent,her,body,backward,and,his,lips,traveled,down,her,throat,to,where,the,cameo,fastened,her,basque,<END>
sweet,he,whispered,<END>
sweet,<END>
she,saw,the,wagon,dimly,in,the,dark,and,heard,the,treble,piping,of,wade's,voice,<END>
muvver,<END>
wade,fwightened,<END>
into,her,swaying,darkened,mind,cold,sanity,came,back,with,a,rush,and,she,remembered,what,she,had,forgotten,for,the,moment,that,she,was,frightened,too,and,rhett,was,leaving,her,leaving,her,the,damned,cad,<END>
and,on,top,of,it,all,he,had,the,consummate,gall,to,stand,here,in,the,road,and,insult,her,with,his,infamous,proposals,<END>
rage,and,hate,flowed,into,her,and,stiffened,her,spine,and,with,one,wrench,she,tore,herself,loose,from,his,arms,<END>
oh,you,cad,<END>
she,cried,and,her,mind,leaped,about,trying,to,think,of,worse,things,to,call,him,things,she,had,heard,gerald,call,mr,lincoln,the,macintoshes,and,balky,mules,but,the,words,would,not,come,<END>
you,low-down,cowardly,nasty,stinking,thing,<END>
and,because,she,could,not,think,of,anything,crushing,enough,she,drew,back,her,arm,and,slapped,him,across,the,mouth,with,all,the,force,she,had,left,<END>
he,took,a,step,backward,his,hand,going,to,his,face,<END>
ah,he,said,quietly,and,for,a,moment,they,stood,facing,each,other,in,the,darkness,<END>
scarlett,could,hear,his,heavy,breathing,and,her,own,breath,came,in,gasps,as,if,she,had,been,running,hard,<END>
they,were,right,<END>
everybody,was,right,<END>
you,aren't,a,gentleman,<END>

she,heard,him,laugh,as,he,turned,away,and,walked,back,toward,the,wagon,<END>
she,saw,him,stand,beside,it,heard,him,speak,and,his,voice,was,changed,courteous,and,respectful,as,it,always,was,when,he,spoke,to,melanie,<END>

his,feet,ground,on,the,pebbles,of,the,road,and,for,a,moment,she,saw,his,big,shoulders,looming,up,in,the,dark,<END>
then,he,was,gone,<END>
she,could,hear,the,sound,of,his,feet,for,a,while,and,then,they,died,away,<END>
she,came,slowly,back,to,the,wagon,her,knees,shaking,<END>

why,had,he,gone,rhett,who,loved,the,pleasures,of,women,and,liquor,the,comfort,of,good,food,and,soft,beds,the,feel,of,fine,linen,and,good,leather,who,hated,the,south,and,jeered,at,the,fools,who,fought,for,it,<END>
now,he,had,set,his,varnished,boots,upon,a,bitter,road,where,hunger,tramped,with,tireless,stride,and,wounds,and,weariness,and,heartbreak,ran,like,yelping,wolves,<END>
and,the,end,of,the,road,was,death,<END>
he,need,not,have,gone,<END>
he,was,safe,rich,comfortable,<END>
but,he,had,gone,leaving,her,alone,in,a,night,as,black,as,blindness,with,the,yankee,army,between,her,and,home,<END>
now,she,remembered,all,the,bad,names,she,had,wanted,to,call,him,but,it,was,too,late,<END>
she,leaned,her,head,against,the,bowed,neck,of,the,horse,and,cried,<END>
chapter,xxiv,<END>
the,bright,glare,of,morning,sunlight,streaming,through,the,trees,overhead,awakened,scarlett,<END>
for,a,moment,stiffened,by,the,cramped,position,in,which,she,had,slept,she,could,not,remember,where,she,was,<END>
the,sun,blinded,her,the,hard,boards,of,the,wagon,under,her,were,harsh,against,her,body,and,a,heavy,weight,lay,across,her,legs,<END>
she,tried,to,sit,up,and,discovered,that,the,weight,was,wade,who,lay,sleeping,with,his,head,pillowed,on,her,knees,<END>
melanie's,bare,feet,were,almost,in,her,face,and,under,the,wagon,seat,prissy,was,curled,up,like,a,black,cat,with,the,small,baby,wedged,in,between,her,and,wade,<END>
then,she,remembered,everything,<END>
she,popped,up,to,a,sitting,position,and,looked,hastily,all,around,<END>
thank,god,no,yankees,in,sight,<END>
their,hiding,place,had,not,been,discovered,in,the,night,<END>
it,all,came,back,to,her,now,the,nightmare,journey,after,rhett's,footsteps,died,away,the,endless,night,the,black,road,full,of,ruts,and,boulders,along,which,they,jolted,the,deep,gullies,on,either,side,into,which,the,wagon,slipped,the,fear-crazed,strength,with,which,she,and,prissy,had,pushed,the,wheels,out,of,the,gullies,<END>
she,recalled,with,a,shudder,how,often,she,had,driven,the,unwilling,horse,into,fields,and,woods,when,she,heard,soldiers,approaching,not,knowing,if,they,were,friends,or,foes,recalled,too,her,anguish,lest,a,cough,a,sneeze,or,wade's,hiccoughing,might,betray,them,to,the,marching,men,<END>
oh,that,dark,road,where,men,went,by,like,ghosts,voices,stilled,only,the,muffled,tramping,of,feet,on,soft,dirt,the,faint,clicking,of,bridles,and,the,straining,creak,of,leather,<END>
and,oh,that,dreadful,moment,when,the,sick,horse,balked,and,cavalry,and,light,cannon,rumbled,past,in,the,darkness,past,where,they,sat,breathless,so,close,she,could,almost,reach,out,and,touch,them,so,close,she,could,smell,the,stale,sweat,on,the,soldiers',bodies,<END>

she,had,circled,through,a,plowed,field,for,a,mile,until,the,light,of,the,fires,died,out,behind,her,<END>
and,then,she,had,lost,her,way,in,the,darkness,and,sobbed,when,she,could,not,find,the,little,wagon,path,she,knew,so,well,<END>
then,finally,having,found,it,the,horse,sank,in,the,traces,and,refused,to,move,refused,to,rise,even,when,she,and,prissy,tugged,at,the,bridle,<END>
so,she,had,unharnessed,him,and,crawled,sodden,with,fatigue,into,the,back,of,the,wagon,and,stretched,her,aching,legs,<END>
she,had,a,faint,memory,of,melanie's,voice,before,sleep,clamped,down,her,eyelids,a,weak,voice,that,apologized,even,as,it,begged,scarlett,can,i,have,some,water,please,<END>
she,had,said,there,isn't,any,and,gone,to,sleep,before,the,words,were,out,of,her,mouth,<END>
now,it,was,morning,and,the,world,was,still,and,serene,and,green,and,gold,with,dappled,sunshine,<END>
and,no,soldiers,in,sight,anywhere,<END>
she,was,hungry,and,dry,with,thirst,aching,and,cramped,and,filled,with,wonder,that,she,scarlett,o'hara,who,could,never,rest,well,except,between,linen,sheets,and,on,the,softest,of,feather,beds,had,slept,like,a,field,hand,on,hard,planks,<END>

she,looked,dead,<END>
she,looked,like,a,dead,old,woman,with,her,ravaged,face,and,her,dark,hair,snarled,and,tangled,across,it,<END>
then,scarlett,saw,with,relief,the,faint,rise,and,fall,of,her,shallow,breathing,and,knew,that,melanie,had,survived,the,night,<END>
scarlett,shaded,her,eyes,with,her,hand,and,looked,about,her,<END>
they,had,evidently,spent,the,night,under,the,trees,in,someone's,front,yard,for,a,sand,and,gravel,driveway,stretched,out,before,her,winding,away,under,an,avenue,of,cedars,<END>
why,it's,the,mallory,place,<END>

the,shrubs,and,grass,of,the,lawn,were,cut,to,pieces,where,hooves,and,wheels,and,feet,had,torn,frantically,back,and,forth,until,the,soil,was,churned,up,<END>
she,looked,toward,the,house,and,instead,of,the,old,white,clapboard,place,she,knew,so,well,she,saw,there,only,a,long,rectangle,of,blackened,granite,foundation,stones,and,two,tall,chimneys,rearing,smoke-stained,bricks,into,the,charred,leaves,of,still,trees,<END>
she,drew,a,deep,shuddering,breath,<END>

prissy,climbed,reluctantly,from,the,wagon,with,many,groans,and,timorously,followed,scarlett,up,the,avenue,<END>

those,she,found,on,the,ground,were,mostly,rotten,<END>

when,she,came,back,she,divided,up,the,apples,and,threw,the,rest,into,the,back,of,the,wagon,<END>
the,horse,was,on,his,feet,now,but,the,water,did,not,seem,to,have,refreshed,him,much,<END>

there,was,death,in,the,air,<END>
in,the,rays,of,the,late,afternoon,sun,every,well-remembered,field,and,forest,grove,was,green,and,still,with,an,unearthly,quiet,that,struck,terror,to,scarlett's,heart,<END>
every,empty,shell-pitted,house,they,had,passed,that,day,every,gaunt,chimney,standing,sentinel,over,smoke-blackened,ruins,had,frightened,her,more,<END>

the,dear,white,walls,the,windows,with,the,fluttering,curtains,the,wide,verandas,were,they,all,there,ahead,of,her,in,the,gloom,<END>

the,avenue,seemed,miles,long,and,the,horse,pulling,stubbornly,at,her,hand,plopped,slower,and,slower,<END>

the,white,walls,did,show,there,through,the,darkness,<END>

tara,was,not,deserted,<END>
someone,was,home,<END>
a,cry,of,joy,rose,to,her,throat,and,died,there,<END>

what,was,wrong,<END>
what,was,wrong,<END>
tara,stood,intact,yet,shrouded,with,the,same,eerie,quiet,that,hung,over,the,whole,stricken,countryside,<END>

putting,out,his,hand,he,laid,it,on,her,shoulder,<END>

gerald's,shoulders,sagged,<END>
in,the,face,which,she,could,only,see,dimly,there,was,none,of,the,virility,the,restless,vitality,of,gerald,and,the,eyes,that,looked,into,hers,had,almost,the,same,fear-stunned,look,that,lay,in,little,wade's,eyes,<END>
he,was,only,a,little,old,man,and,broken,<END>
and,now,fear,of,unknown,things,seized,her,leaped,swiftly,out,of,the,darkness,at,her,and,she,could,only,stand,and,stare,at,him,all,the,flood,of,questioning,dammed,up,at,her,lips,<END>
from,the,wagon,the,faint,wailing,sounded,again,and,gerald,seemed,to,rouse,himself,with,an,effort,<END>

she's,very,ill,i,brought,her,home,<END>
gerald,dropped,his,hand,from,her,arm,and,straightened,his,shoulders,<END>
as,he,moved,slowly,to,the,side,of,the,wagon,there,was,a,ghostly,semblance,of,the,old,host,of,tara,welcoming,guests,as,if,gerald,spoke,words,from,out,of,shadowy,memory,<END>
cousin,melanie,<END>
melanie's,voice,murmured,indistinctly,<END>

she,must,be,carried,<END>
she,can't,walk,<END>

a,moan,was,wrenched,from,melanie,as,he,half-lifted,half-dragged,her,from,the,feather,tick,on,which,she,had,lain,so,many,hours,<END>

prissy,holding,the,baby,and,dragging,wade,by,the,hand,followed,them,up,the,wide,steps,and,disappeared,into,the,blackness,of,the,hall,<END>

as,if,answering,the,question,in,her,mind,gerald,spoke,<END>

she,avoided,the,high-backed,chairs,the,empty,gun,rack,the,old,sideboard,with,its,protruding,claw,feet,and,she,felt,herself,drawn,by,instinct,to,the,tiny,office,at,the,back,of,the,house,where,ellen,always,sat,keeping,her,endless,accounts,<END>

his,voice,trailed,off,into,silence,as,he,looked,absently,about,the,walls,and,scarlett,understood,<END>
there,were,too,many,irish,ancestors,crowding,behind,gerald's,shoulders,men,who,had,died,on,scant,acres,fighting,to,the,end,rather,than,leave,the,homes,where,they,had,lived,plowed,loved,begotten,sons,<END>

a,yankee,a,gentleman,<END>

he,galloped,away,and,soon,he,was,back,with,a,captain,a,surgeon,and,he,looked,at,the,girls,and,your,mother,<END>
you,let,a,damned,yankee,into,their,room,<END>
he,had,opium,<END>
we,had,none,<END>

he,was,as,kind,as,he,knew,how,<END>
and,when,he,reported,that,they,were,ill,they,did,not,burn,the,house,<END>
they,moved,in,some,general,his,staff,crowding,in,<END>
they,filled,all,the,rooms,except,the,sick,room,<END>

he,paused,again,as,if,too,tired,to,go,on,<END>
his,stubbly,chin,sank,heavily,in,loose,folds,of,flesh,on,his,chest,<END>
with,an,effort,he,spoke,again,<END>
they,camped,all,round,the,house,everywhere,in,the,cotton,in,the,corn,<END>
the,pasture,was,blue,with,them,<END>
that,night,there,were,a,thousand,campfires,<END>
they,tore,down,the,fences,and,burned,them,to,cook,with,and,the,barns,and,the,stables,and,the,smokehouse,<END>
they,killed,the,cows,and,the,hogs,and,the,chickens,even,my,turkeys,<END>

the,silver,<END>
pork,and,mammy,did,something,with,the,silver,put,it,in,the,well,but,i'm,not,remembering,now,gerald's,voice,was,fretful,<END>
then,they,fought,the,battle,from,here,from,tara,there,was,so,much,noise,people,galloping,up,and,stamping,about,<END>
and,later,the,cannon,at,jonesboro,it,sounded,like,thunder,even,the,girls,could,hear,it,sick,as,they,were,and,they,kept,saying,over,and,over,'papa,make,it,stop,thundering,',<END>

after,he'd,worked,all,day,with,the,wounded,he,came,and,sat,with,them,<END>
he,even,left,some,medicine,<END>

he,said,she,had,undermined,her,strength,<END>
in,the,silence,that,fell,scarlett,saw,her,mother,as,she,must,have,been,in,those,last,days,a,thin,power,of,strength,in,tara,nursing,working,doing,without,sleep,and,food,that,the,others,might,rest,and,eat,<END>
and,then,they,moved,on,<END>
then,they,moved,on,<END>
he,was,silent,for,a,long,time,and,then,fumbled,at,her,hand,<END>
it's,glad,i,am,you,are,home,he,said,simply,<END>
there,was,a,scraping,noise,on,the,back,porch,<END>
poor,pork,trained,for,forty,years,to,clean,his,shoes,before,entering,the,house,did,not,forget,even,in,a,time,like,this,<END>
he,came,in,carefully,carrying,two,gourds,and,the,strong,smell,of,dripping,spirits,entered,before,him,<END>

it's,pow'ful,hard,ter,po',outer,a,bung,hole,inter,a,go'de,<END>

gerald,raised,it,obedient,as,a,child,and,gulped,noisily,<END>
she,handed,the,water,to,him,but,he,shook,his,head,<END>
as,she,took,the,whisky,from,him,and,held,it,to,her,mouth,she,saw,his,eyes,follow,her,a,vague,stirring,of,disapproval,in,them,<END>
i,know,no,lady,drinks,spirits,she,said,briefly,<END>
but,today,i'm,no,lady,pa,and,there,is,work,to,do,tonight,<END>
she,tilted,the,dipper,drew,a,deep,breath,and,drank,swiftly,<END>
the,hot,liquid,burned,down,her,throat,to,her,stomach,choking,her,and,bringing,tears,to,her,eyes,<END>
she,drew,another,breath,and,raised,it,again,<END>
katie,scarlett,said,gerald,the,first,note,of,authority,she,had,heard,in,his,voice,since,her,return,that,is,enough,<END>
you're,not,knowing,spirits,and,they,will,be,making,you,tipsy,<END>
tipsy,<END>
she,laughed,an,ugly,laugh,<END>
tipsy,<END>
i,hope,it,makes,me,drunk,<END>
i,would,like,to,be,drunk,and,forget,all,of,this,<END>
she,drank,again,a,slow,train,of,warmth,lighting,in,her,veins,and,stealing,through,her,body,until,even,her,finger,tips,tingled,<END>
what,a,blessed,feeling,this,kindly,fire,<END>
it,seemed,to,penetrate,even,her,ice-locked,heart,and,strength,came,coursing,back,into,her,body,<END>
seeing,gerald's,puzzled,hurt,face,she,patted,his,knee,again,and,managed,an,imitation,of,the,pert,smile,he,used,to,love,<END>
how,could,it,make,me,tipsy,pa,<END>
i'm,your,daughter,<END>
haven't,i,inherited,the,steadiest,head,in,clayton,county,<END>
he,almost,smiled,into,her,tired,face,<END>
the,whisky,was,bracing,him,too,<END>
she,handed,it,back,to,him,<END>
now,you're,going,to,take,another,drink,and,then,i,am,going,to,take,you,upstairs,and,put,you,to,bed,<END>
she,caught,herself,<END>
why,this,was,the,way,she,talked,to,wade,she,should,not,address,her,father,like,this,<END>
it,was,disrespectful,<END>
but,he,hung,on,her,words,<END>
yes,put,you,to,bed,she,added,lightly,and,give,you,another,drink,maybe,all,the,dipper,and,make,you,go,to,sleep,<END>
you,need,sleep,and,katie,scarlett,is,here,so,you,need,not,worry,about,anything,<END>

he,drank,again,obediently,and,slipping,her,arm,through,his,she,pulled,him,to,his,feet,<END>
pork,<END>
pork,took,the,gourd,in,one,hand,and,gerald's,arm,in,the,other,<END>
scarlett,picked,up,the,flaring,candle,and,the,three,walked,slowly,into,the,dark,hall,and,up,the,winding,steps,toward,gerald's,room,<END>
the,room,where,suellen,and,carreen,lay,mumbling,and,tossing,on,the,same,bed,stank,vilely,with,the,smell,of,the,twisted,rag,burning,in,a,saucer,of,bacon,fat,which,provided,the,only,light,<END>
when,scarlett,first,opened,the,door,the,thick,atmosphere,of,the,room,with,all,windows,closed,and,the,air,reeking,with,sick-room,odors,medicine,smells,and,stinking,grease,almost,made,her,faint,<END>
doctors,might,say,that,fresh,air,was,fatal,in,a,sick,room,but,if,she,were,to,sit,here,she,must,have,air,or,die,<END>
she,opened,the,three,windows,bringing,in,the,smell,of,oak,leaves,and,earth,but,the,fresh,air,could,do,little,toward,dispelling,the,sickening,odors,which,had,accumulated,for,weeks,in,this,close,room,<END>
carreen,and,suellen,emaciated,and,white,slept,brokenly,and,awoke,to,mumble,with,wide,staring,eyes,in,the,tall,four-poster,bed,where,they,had,whispered,together,in,better,happier,days,<END>
in,the,corner,of,the,room,was,an,empty,bed,a,narrow,french,empire,bed,with,curling,head,and,foot,a,bed,which,ellen,had,brought,from,savannah,<END>
this,was,where,ellen,had,lain,<END>
scarlett,sat,beside,the,two,girls,staring,at,them,stupidly,<END>
the,whisky,taken,on,a,stomach,long,empty,was,playing,tricks,on,her,<END>
sometimes,her,sisters,seemed,far,away,and,tiny,and,their,incoherent,voices,came,to,her,like,the,buzz,of,insects,<END>
and,again,they,loomed,large,rushing,at,her,with,lightning,speed,<END>
she,was,tired,tired,to,the,bone,<END>
she,could,lie,down,and,sleep,for,days,<END>
if,she,could,only,lie,down,and,sleep,and,wake,to,feel,ellen,gently,shaking,her,arm,and,saying,it,is,late,scarlett,<END>

the,door,opened,softly,and,dilcey,entered,melanie's,baby,held,to,her,breast,the,gourd,of,whisky,in,her,hand,<END>
in,the,smoky,uncertain,light,she,seemed,thinner,than,when,scarlett,last,saw,her,and,the,indian,blood,was,more,evident,in,her,face,<END>
the,high,cheek,bones,were,more,prominent,the,hawk-bridged,nose,was,sharper,and,her,copper,skin,gleamed,with,a,brighter,hue,<END>
her,faded,calico,dress,was,open,to,the,waist,and,her,large,bronze,breast,exposed,<END>
held,close,against,her,melanie's,baby,pressed,his,pale,rosebud,mouth,greedily,to,the,dark,nipple,sucking,gripping,tiny,fists,against,the,soft,flesh,like,a,kitten,in,the,warm,fur,of,its,mother's,belly,<END>

and,when,ashley,came,home,if,he,did,come,home,<END>

if,only,she,could,put,off,the,hour,of,reckoning,forever,<END>
she,started,suddenly,as,a,creaking,noise,and,a,rhythmic,ker-bunk,ker-bunk,broke,the,stillness,of,the,air,outside,<END>

her,nerves,must,be,shredded,if,the,noise,of,the,well,windlass,bound,up,in,her,earliest,memories,could,frighten,her,<END>
dilcey,looked,at,her,steadily,as,she,laughed,her,face,immobile,in,its,dignity,but,scarlett,felt,that,dilcey,understood,<END>

soon,mammy,would,be,with,her,ellen's,mammy,her,mammy,<END>
she,sat,silent,intent,on,nothing,while,the,baby,already,glutted,with,milk,whimpered,because,he,had,lost,the,friendly,nipple,<END>
dilcey,silent,too,guided,the,child's,mouth,back,quieting,him,in,her,arms,as,scarlett,listened,to,the,slow,scuffing,of,mammy's,feet,across,the,back,yard,<END>
how,still,the,night,air,was,<END>
the,slightest,sounds,roared,in,her,ears,<END>
the,upstairs,hall,seemed,to,shake,as,mammy's,ponderous,weight,came,toward,the,door,<END>
then,mammy,was,in,the,room,mammy,with,shoulders,dragged,down,by,two,heavy,wooden,buckets,her,kind,black,face,sad,with,the,uncomprehending,sadness,of,a,monkey's,face,<END>
her,eyes,lighted,up,at,the,sight,of,scarlett,her,white,teeth,gleamed,as,she,set,down,the,buckets,and,scarlett,ran,to,her,laying,her,head,on,the,broad,sagging,breasts,which,had,held,so,many,heads,black,and,white,<END>
here,was,something,of,stability,thought,scarlett,something,of,the,old,life,that,was,unchanging,<END>

if,she,was,overly,kind,to,them,they'd,probably,prolong,their,stay,in,bed,and,she,wanted,them,on,their,feet,again,as,soon,as,possible,so,there,would,be,four,more,hands,to,help,her,<END>

it,was,a,horse,the,tarletons,the,fontaines,<END>
she,looked,up,quickly,<END>
it,was,a,yankee,cavalryman,<END>
automatically,she,dodged,behind,the,curtain,and,peered,fascinated,at,him,through,the,dim,folds,of,the,cloth,so,startled,that,the,breath,went,out,of,her,lungs,with,a,gasp,<END>

a,yankee,a,yankee,with,a,long,pistol,on,his,hip,<END>

her,first,terrified,impulse,was,to,hide,in,the,closet,crawl,under,the,bed,fly,down,the,back,stairs,and,run,screaming,to,the,swamp,anything,to,escape,him,<END>
then,she,heard,his,cautious,feet,on,the,front,steps,and,his,stealthy,tread,as,he,entered,the,hall,and,she,knew,that,escape,was,cut,off,<END>
too,cold,with,fear,to,move,she,heard,his,progress,from,room,to,room,downstairs,his,steps,growing,louder,and,bolder,as,he,discovered,no,one,<END>
now,he,was,in,the,dining,room,and,in,a,moment,he,would,walk,out,into,the,kitchen,<END>
at,the,thought,of,the,kitchen,rage,suddenly,leaped,up,in,scarlett's,breast,so,sharply,that,it,jabbed,at,her,heart,like,a,knife,thrust,and,fear,fell,away,before,her,overpowering,fury,<END>
the,kitchen,<END>
there,over,the,open,kitchen,fire,were,two,pots,one,filled,with,apples,stewing,and,the,other,with,a,hodgepodge,of,vegetables,brought,painfully,from,twelve,oaks,and,the,macintosh,garden,dinner,that,must,serve,for,nine,hungry,people,and,hardly,enough,for,two,<END>
scarlett,had,been,restraining,her,appetite,for,hours,waiting,for,the,return,of,the,others,and,the,thought,of,the,yankee,eating,their,meager,meal,made,her,shake,with,anger,<END>
god,damn,them,all,<END>
they,descended,like,locusts,and,left,tara,to,starve,slowly,and,now,they,were,back,again,to,steal,the,poor,leavings,<END>
her,empty,stomach,writhed,within,her,<END>
by,god,this,was,one,yankee,who,would,do,no,more,stealing,<END>
she,slipped,off,her,worn,shoe,and,barefooted,she,pattered,swiftly,to,the,bureau,not,even,feeling,her,festered,toe,<END>
she,opened,the,top,drawer,soundlessly,and,caught,up,the,heavy,pistol,she,had,brought,from,atlanta,the,weapon,charles,had,worn,but,never,fired,<END>
she,fumbled,in,the,leather,box,that,hung,on,the,wall,below,his,saber,and,brought,out,a,cap,<END>
she,slipped,it,into,place,with,a,hand,that,did,not,shake,<END>
quickly,and,noiselessly,she,ran,into,the,upper,hall,and,down,the,stairs,steadying,herself,on,the,banisters,with,one,hand,and,holding,the,pistol,close,to,her,thigh,in,the,folds,of,her,skirt,<END>
who's,there,<END>
cried,a,nasal,voice,and,she,stopped,on,the,middle,of,the,stairs,the,blood,thudding,in,her,ears,so,loudly,she,could,hardly,hear,him,<END>
halt,or,i'll,shoot,<END>
came,the,voice,<END>
he,stood,in,the,door,of,the,dining,room,crouched,tensely,his,pistol,in,one,hand,and,in,the,other,the,small,rosewood,sewing,box,fitted,with,gold,thimble,gold-handled,scissors,and,tiny,gold-,topped,acorn,of,emery,<END>
scarlett's,legs,felt,cold,to,the,knees,but,rage,scorched,her,face,<END>
ellen's,sewing,box,in,his,hands,<END>
she,wanted,to,cry,put,it,down,<END>
put,it,down,you,dirty,but,words,would,not,come,<END>
she,could,only,stare,over,the,banisters,at,him,and,watch,his,face,change,from,harsh,tenseness,to,a,half-contemptuous,half-ingratiating,smile,<END>
so,there,is,somebody,ter,home,he,said,slipping,his,pistol,back,into,its,holster,and,moving,into,the,hall,until,he,stood,directly,below,her,<END>
all,alone,little,lady,<END>
like,lightning,she,shoved,her,weapon,over,the,banisters,and,into,the,startled,bearded,face,<END>
before,he,could,even,fumble,at,his,belt,she,pulled,the,trigger,<END>
the,back,kick,of,the,pistol,made,her,reel,as,the,roar,of,the,explosion,filled,her,ears,and,the,acrid,smoke,stung,her,nostrils,<END>
the,man,crashed,backwards,to,the,floor,sprawling,into,the,dining,room,with,a,violence,that,shook,the,furniture,<END>
the,box,clattered,from,his,hand,the,contents,spilling,about,him,<END>
hardly,aware,that,she,was,moving,scarlett,ran,down,the,stairs,and,stood,over,him,gazing,down,into,what,was,left,of,the,face,above,the,beard,a,bloody,pit,where,the,nose,had,been,glazing,eyes,burned,with,powder,<END>
as,she,looked,two,streams,of,blood,crept,across,the,shining,floor,one,from,his,face,and,one,from,the,back,of,his,head,<END>
yes,he,was,dead,<END>
undoubtedly,<END>
she,had,killed,a,man,<END>
the,smoke,curled,slowly,to,the,ceiling,and,the,red,streams,widened,about,her,feet,<END>
for,a,timeless,moment,she,stood,there,and,in,the,still,hot,hush,of,the,summer,morning,every,irrelevant,sound,and,scent,seemed,magnified,the,quick,thudding,of,her,heart,like,a,drumbeat,the,slight,rough,rustling,of,the,magnolia,leaves,the,far-off,plaintive,sound,of,a,swamp,bird,and,the,sweet,smell,of,the,flowers,outside,the,window,<END>
she,had,killed,a,man,she,who,took,care,never,to,be,in,at,the,kill,on,a,hunt,she,who,could,not,bear,the,squealing,of,a,hog,at,slaughter,or,the,squeak,of,a,rabbit,in,a,snare,<END>
murder,<END>

i've,done,murder,<END>

her,eyes,went,to,the,stubby,hairy,hand,on,the,floor,so,close,to,the,sewing,box,and,suddenly,she,was,vitally,alive,again,vitally,glad,with,a,cool,tigerish,joy,<END>
she,could,have,ground,her,heel,into,the,gaping,wound,which,had,been,his,nose,and,taken,sweet,pleasure,in,the,feel,of,his,warm,blood,on,her,bare,feet,<END>
she,had,struck,a,blow,of,revenge,for,tara,and,for,ellen,<END>
there,were,hurried,stumbling,steps,in,the,upper,hall,a,pause,and,then,more,steps,weak,dragging,steps,now,punctuated,by,metallic,clankings,<END>
a,sense,of,time,and,reality,coming,back,to,her,scarlett,looked,up,and,saw,melanie,at,the,top,of,the,stairs,clad,only,in,the,ragged,chemise,which,served,her,as,a,nightgown,her,weak,arm,weighed,down,with,charles',saber,<END>

in,silence,her,eyes,met,scarlett's,<END>
there,was,a,glow,of,grim,pride,in,her,usually,gentle,face,approbation,and,a,fierce,joy,in,her,smile,that,equaled,the,fiery,tumult,in,scarlett's,own,bosom,<END>

now,struggling,against,hatred,for,ashley's,wife,there,surged,a,feeling,of,admiration,and,comradeship,<END>
she,saw,in,a,flash,of,clarity,untouched,by,any,petty,emotion,that,beneath,the,gentle,voice,and,the,dovelike,eyes,of,melanie,there,was,a,thin,flashing,blade,of,unbreakable,steel,felt,too,that,there,were,banners,and,bugles,of,courage,in,melanie's,quiet,blood,<END>

swiftly,melanie,put,her,finger,to,her,lips,and,laying,the,sword,on,the,top,step,she,painfully,made,her,way,down,the,upstairs,hall,and,opened,the,door,of,the,sick,room,<END>

they've,got,to,know,i've,done,it,<END>

you,take,the,knapsack,and,i'll,go,through,his,pockets,<END>
stooping,over,the,dead,man,with,distaste,she,unbuttoned,the,remaining,buttons,of,his,jacket,and,systematically,began,rifling,his,pockets,<END>
dear,god,she,whispered,pulling,out,a,bulging,wallet,wrapped,about,with,a,rag,<END>
melanie,melly,i,think,it's,full,of,money,<END>
melanie,said,nothing,but,abruptly,sat,down,on,the,floor,and,leaned,back,against,the,wall,<END>
you,look,she,said,shakily,<END>
i'm,feeling,a,little,weak,<END>
scarlett,tore,off,the,rag,and,with,trembling,hands,opened,the,leather,folds,<END>
look,melly,just,look,<END>
melanie,looked,and,her,eyes,dilated,<END>
jumbled,together,was,a,mass,of,bills,united,states,greenbacks,mingling,with,confederate,money,and,glinting,from,between,them,were,one,ten-dollar,gold,piece,and,two,five-dollar,gold,pieces,<END>
don't,stop,to,count,it,now,said,melanie,as,scarlett,began,fingering,the,bills,<END>
we,haven't,time,<END>
do,you,realize,melanie,that,this,money,means,that,we'll,eat,<END>
yes,yes,dear,<END>
i,know,but,we,haven't,time,now,<END>
you,look,in,his,other,pockets,and,i'll,take,the,knapsack,<END>
scarlett,was,loath,to,put,down,the,wallet,<END>
bright,vistas,opened,before,her,real,money,the,yankee's,horse,food,<END>
there,was,a,god,after,all,and,he,did,provide,even,if,he,did,take,very,odd,ways,of,providing,<END>

she,said,<END>
the,trouser,pockets,yielded,nothing,except,a,candle,end,a,jackknife,a,plug,of,tobacco,and,a,bit,of,twine,<END>
melanie,removed,from,the,knapsack,a,small,package,of,coffee,which,she,sniffed,as,if,it,were,the,sweetest,of,perfumes,hardtack,and,her,face,changing,a,miniature,of,a,little,girl,in,a,gold,frame,set,with,seed,pearls,a,garnet,brooch,two,broad,gold,bracelets,with,tiny,dangling,gold,chains,a,gold,thimble,a,small,silver,baby's,cup,gold,embroidery,scissors,a,diamond,solitaire,ring,and,a,pair,of,earrings,with,pendant,pear-shaped,diamonds,which,even,their,unpracticed,eyes,could,tell,were,well,over,a,carat,each,<END>
a,thief,<END>
whispered,melanie,recoiling,from,the,still,body,<END>
scarlett,he,must,have,stolen,all,of,this,<END>
of,course,said,scarlett,<END>
and,he,came,here,hoping,to,steal,more,from,us,<END>
i'm,glad,you,killed,him,said,melanie,her,gentle,eyes,hard,<END>
now,hurry,darling,and,get,him,out,of,here,<END>
scarlett,bent,over,caught,the,dead,man,by,his,boots,and,tugged,<END>
how,heavy,he,was,and,how,weak,she,suddenly,felt,<END>
suppose,she,shouldn't,be,able,to,move,him,<END>
turning,so,that,she,backed,the,corpse,she,caught,a,heavy,boot,under,each,arm,and,threw,her,weight,forward,<END>
he,moved,and,she,jerked,again,<END>
her,sore,foot,forgotten,in,the,excitement,now,gave,a,tremendous,throb,that,made,her,grit,her,teeth,and,shift,her,weight,to,the,heel,<END>
tugging,and,straining,perspiration,dripping,from,her,forehead,she,dragged,him,down,the,hall,a,red,stain,following,her,path,<END>

give,me,your,shimmy,melanie,and,i'll,wad,it,around,his,head,<END>
melanie's,white,face,went,crimson,<END>
don't,be,silly,i,won't,look,at,you,said,scarlett,<END>
if,i,had,on,a,petticoat,or,pantalets,i'd,use,them,<END>
crouching,back,against,the,wall,melanie,pulled,the,ragged,linen,garment,over,her,head,and,silently,tossed,it,to,scarlett,shielding,herself,as,best,she,could,with,her,arms,<END>
thank,god,i'm,not,that,modest,thought,scarlett,feeling,rather,than,seeing,melanie's,agony,of,embarrassment,as,she,wrapped,the,ragged,cloth,about,the,shattered,face,<END>
by,a,series,of,limping,jerks,she,pulled,the,body,down,the,hall,toward,the,back,porch,and,pausing,to,wipe,her,forehead,with,the,back,of,her,hand,glanced,back,toward,melanie,sitting,against,the,wall,hugging,her,thin,knees,to,her,bare,breasts,<END>
how,silly,of,melanie,to,be,bothering,about,modesty,at,a,time,like,this,scarlett,thought,irritably,<END>
it,was,just,part,of,her,nicey-nice,way,of,acting,which,had,always,made,scarlett,despise,her,<END>
then,shame,rose,in,her,<END>
after,all,after,all,melanie,had,dragged,herself,from,bed,so,soon,after,having,a,baby,and,had,come,to,her,aid,with,a,weapon,too,heavy,even,for,her,to,lift,<END>
that,had,taken,courage,the,kind,of,courage,scarlett,honestly,knew,she,herself,did,not,possess,the,thin-steel,spun-silk,courage,which,had,characterized,melanie,on,the,terrible,night,atlanta,fell,and,on,the,long,trip,home,<END>
it,was,the,same,intangible,unspectacular,courage,that,all,the,wilkeses,possessed,a,quality,which,scarlett,did,not,understand,but,to,which,she,gave,grudging,tribute,<END>
go,back,to,bed,she,threw,over,her,shoulder,<END>
you'll,be,dead,if,you,don't,<END>
i'll,clean,up,the,mess,after,i've,buried,him,<END>

well,kill,yourself,then,and,see,if,i,care,<END>

melanie,sat,shivering,in,the,morning,sunlight,and,covered,her,ears,against,the,sickening,series,of,thuds,as,the,dead,man's,head,bumped,down,the,porch,steps,<END>
no,one,questioned,whence,the,horse,had,come,<END>
it,was,so,obvious,he,was,a,stray,from,the,recent,battle,and,they,were,well,pleased,to,have,him,<END>
the,yankee,lay,in,the,shallow,pit,scarlett,had,scraped,out,under,the,scuppernong,arbor,<END>
the,uprights,which,held,the,thick,vines,were,rotten,and,that,night,scarlett,hacked,at,them,with,the,kitchen,knife,until,they,fell,and,the,tangled,mass,ran,wild,over,the,grave,<END>
the,replacing,of,these,posts,was,one,bit,of,repair,work,scarlett,did,not,suggest,and,if,the,negroes,knew,why,they,kept,their,silence,<END>
no,ghost,rose,from,that,shallow,grave,to,haunt,her,in,the,long,nights,when,she,lay,awake,too,tired,to,sleep,<END>
no,feeling,of,horror,or,remorse,assailed,her,at,the,memory,<END>
she,wondered,why,knowing,that,even,a,month,before,she,could,never,have,done,the,deed,<END>
pretty,young,mrs,hamilton,with,her,dimple,and,her,jingling,earbobs,and,her,helpless,little,ways,blowing,a,man's,face,to,a,pulp,and,then,burying,him,in,a,hastily,scratched-out,hole,<END>
scarlett,grinned,a,little,grimly,thinking,of,the,consternation,such,an,idea,would,bring,to,those,who,knew,her,<END>
i,won't,think,about,it,any,more,she,decided,<END>
it's,over,and,done,with,and,i'd,have,been,a,ninny,not,to,kill,him,<END>
i,reckon,i,reckon,i,must,have,changed,a,little,since,coming,home,or,else,i,couldn't,have,done,it,<END>
she,did,not,think,of,it,consciously,but,in,the,back,of,her,mind,whenever,she,was,confronted,by,an,unpleasant,and,difficult,task,the,idea,lurked,giving,her,strength,i've,done,murder,and,so,i,can,surely,do,this,<END>
she,had,changed,more,than,she,knew,and,the,shell,of,hardness,which,had,begun,to,form,about,her,heart,when,she,lay,in,the,slave,garden,at,twelve,oaks,was,slowly,thickening,<END>
now,that,she,had,a,horse,scarlett,could,find,out,for,herself,what,had,happened,to,their,neighbors,<END>
since,she,came,home,she,had,wondered,despairingly,a,thousand,times,are,we,the,only,folks,left,in,the,county,<END>

have,they,all,refugeed,to,macon,<END>
with,the,memory,of,the,ruins,of,twelve,oaks,the,macintosh,place,and,the,slattery,shack,fresh,in,her,mind,she,almost,dreaded,to,discover,the,truth,<END>
but,it,was,better,to,know,the,worst,than,to,wonder,<END>
she,decided,to,ride,to,the,fontaines',first,not,because,they,were,the,nearest,neighbors,but,because,old,dr,fontaine,might,be,there,<END>
melanie,needed,a,doctor,<END>
she,was,not,recovering,as,she,should,and,scarlett,was,frightened,by,her,white,weakness,<END>
so,on,the,first,day,when,her,foot,had,healed,enough,to,stand,a,slipper,she,mounted,the,yankee's,horse,<END>
one,foot,in,the,shortened,stirrup,and,the,other,leg,crooked,about,the,pommel,in,an,approximation,of,a,side,saddle,she,set,out,across,the,fields,toward,mimosa,steeling,herself,to,find,it,burned,<END>
to,her,surprise,and,pleasure,she,saw,the,faded,yellow-stucco,house,standing,amid,the,mimosa,trees,looking,as,it,had,always,looked,<END>

but,when,the,first,exclamations,of,affectionate,greeting,were,over,and,they,all,had,trooped,into,the,dining,room,to,sit,down,scarlett,felt,a,chill,<END>
the,yankees,had,not,reached,mimosa,because,it,was,far,off,the,main,road,<END>
and,so,the,fontaines,still,had,their,stock,and,their,provisions,but,mimosa,was,held,by,the,same,strange,silence,that,hung,over,tara,over,the,whole,countryside,<END>
all,the,slaves,except,four,women,house,servants,had,run,away,frightened,by,the,approach,of,the,yankees,<END>

they,were,far,away,from,neighbors,and,unprotected,but,if,they,were,afraid,it,did,not,show,on,their,faces,<END>
probably,thought,scarlett,because,sally,and,young,miss,were,too,afraid,of,the,porcelain-frail,but,indomitable,old,grandma,to,dare,voice,any,qualms,<END>
scarlett,herself,was,afraid,of,the,old,lady,for,she,had,sharp,eyes,and,a,sharper,tongue,and,scarlett,had,felt,them,both,in,the,past,<END>
though,unrelated,by,blood,and,far,apart,in,age,there,was,a,kinship,of,spirit,and,experience,binding,these,women,together,<END>
all,three,wore,home-dyed,mourning,all,were,worn,sad,worried,all,bitter,with,a,bitterness,that,did,not,sulk,or,complain,but,nevertheless,peered,out,from,behind,their,smiles,and,their,words,of,welcome,<END>
for,their,slaves,were,gone,their,money,was,worthless,sally's,husband,joe,had,died,at,gettysburg,and,young,miss,was,also,a,widow,for,young,dr,fontaine,had,died,of,dysentery,at,vicksburg,<END>
the,other,two,boys,alex,and,tony,were,somewhere,in,virginia,and,nobody,knew,whether,they,were,alive,or,dead,and,old,dr,fontaine,was,off,somewhere,with,wheeler's,cavalry,<END>
and,the,old,fool,is,seventy-three,years,old,though,he,tries,to,act,younger,and,he's,as,full,of,rheumatism,as,a,hog,is,of,fleas,said,grandma,proud,of,her,husband,the,light,in,her,eyes,belying,her,sharp,words,<END>

said,the,old,lady,tartly,<END>
one,of,our,darkies,talked,to,a,darky,who'd,seen,a,darky,who'd,been,to,jonesboro,and,except,for,that,we,haven't,heard,anything,<END>
what,they,said,was,that,the,yankees,were,just,squatting,in,atlanta,resting,up,their,men,and,their,horses,but,whether,it's,true,or,not,you're,as,good,a,judge,as,i,am,<END>
not,that,they,wouldn't,need,a,rest,after,the,fight,we,gave,them,<END>
to,think,you've,been,at,tara,all,this,time,and,we,didn't,know,<END>
young,miss,broke,in,<END>
oh,how,i,blame,myself,for,not,riding,over,to,see,<END>

but,i,should,have,made,time,to,go,<END>
it,wasn't,neighborly,of,me,<END>
but,of,course,we,thought,the,yankees,had,burned,tara,like,they,did,twelve,oaks,and,the,macintosh,house,and,that,your,folks,had,gone,to,macon,<END>
and,we,never,dreamed,you,were,home,scarlett,<END>
well,how,were,we,to,know,different,when,mr,o'hara's,darkies,came,through,here,so,scared,they,were,popeyed,and,told,us,the,yankees,were,going,to,burn,tara,<END>
grandma,interrupted,<END>
and,we,could,see,sally,began,<END>
i'm,telling,this,please,said,old,miss,shortly,<END>
and,they,said,the,yankees,were,camped,all,over,tara,and,your,folks,were,fixing,to,go,to,macon,<END>
and,then,that,night,we,saw,the,glare,of,fire,over,toward,tara,and,it,lasted,for,hours,and,it,scared,our,fool,darkies,so,bad,they,all,ran,off,<END>
what,burned,<END>
all,our,cotton,a,hundred,and,fifty,thousand,dollars,worth,said,scarlett,bitterly,<END>
be,thankful,it,wasn't,your,house,said,grandma,leaning,her,chin,on,her,cane,<END>
you,can,always,grow,more,cotton,and,you,can't,grow,a,house,<END>
by,the,bye,had,you,all,started,picking,your,cotton,<END>
no,said,scarlett,and,now,most,of,it,is,ruined,<END>
i,don't,imagine,there's,more,than,three,bales,left,standing,in,the,far,field,in,the,creek,bottom,and,what,earthly,good,will,it,do,<END>
all,our,field,hands,are,gone,and,there's,nobody,to,pick,it,<END>

what's,wrong,with,your,own,pretty,paws,miss,and,those,of,your,sisters,<END>
me,<END>
pick,cotton,<END>

like,a,field,hand,<END>
like,white,trash,<END>
like,the,slattery,women,<END>
white,trash,indeed,<END>
well,isn't,this,generation,soft,and,ladylike,<END>
let,me,tell,you,miss,when,i,was,a,girl,my,father,lost,all,his,money,and,i,wasn't,above,doing,honest,work,with,my,hands,and,in,the,fields,too,till,pa,got,enough,money,to,buy,some,more,darkies,<END>
i've,hoed,my,row,and,i've,picked,my,cotton,and,i,can,do,it,again,if,i,have,to,<END>
and,it,looks,like,i'll,have,to,<END>
white,trash,indeed,<END>
oh,but,mama,fontaine,cried,her,daughter-in-law,casting,imploring,glances,at,the,two,girls,urging,them,to,help,her,smooth,the,old,lady's,feathers,<END>
that,was,so,long,ago,a,different,day,entirely,and,times,have,changed,<END>
times,never,change,when,there's,a,need,for,honest,work,to,be,done,stated,the,sharp-eyed,old,lady,refusing,to,be,soothed,<END>

'when,adam,delved,and,eve,span',<END>
to,change,the,subject,scarlett,hastily,questioned,what,about,the,tarletons,and,the,calverts,<END>

the,yankees,never,got,to,the,tarletons,<END>
they're,off,the,main,road,like,we,are,but,they,did,get,to,the,calverts,and,they,stole,all,their,stock,and,poultry,and,got,all,the,darkies,to,run,off,with,them,sally,began,<END>
grandma,interrupted,<END>
hah,<END>
they,promised,all,the,black,wenches,silk,dresses,and,gold,earbobs,that's,what,they,did,<END>
and,cathleen,calvert,said,some,of,the,troopers,went,off,with,the,black,fools,behind,them,on,their,saddles,<END>
well,all,they'll,get,will,be,yellow,babies,and,i,can't,say,that,yankee,blood,will,improve,the,stock,<END>

don't,pull,such,a,shocked,face,jane,<END>
we're,all,married,aren't,we,<END>
and,god,knows,we've,seen,mulatto,babies,before,this,<END>
why,didn't,they,burn,the,calverts',house,<END>
the,house,was,saved,by,the,combined,accents,of,the,second,mrs,calvert,and,that,yankee,overseer,of,hers,hilton,said,old,miss,who,always,referred,to,the,ex-governess,as,the,second,mrs,calvert,although,the,first,mrs,calvert,had,been,dead,twenty,years,<END>
'we,are,staunch,union,sympathizers,',mimicked,the,old,lady,twanging,the,words,through,her,long,thin,nose,<END>

she,said,cade,would,bust,when,he,came,home,and,heard,about,it,<END>
but,then,that's,what,a,man,gets,for,marrying,a,yankee,woman,no,pride,no,decency,always,thinking,about,their,own,skins,<END>
how,come,they,didn't,burn,tara,scarlett,<END>
for,a,moment,scarlett,paused,before,answering,<END>

she,knew,she,could,not,tell,them,ellen,was,dead,<END>
she,knew,that,if,she,spoke,those,words,or,even,let,herself,think,of,them,in,the,presence,of,these,sympathetic,women,she,would,burst,into,a,storm,of,tears,and,cry,until,she,was,sick,<END>

well,you,see,i,didn't,get,home,till,the,day,after,the,battle,she,answered,hastily,<END>
the,yankees,were,all,gone,then,<END>
pa,pa,told,me,that,that,he,got,them,not,to,burn,the,house,because,suellen,and,carreen,were,so,ill,with,typhoid,they,couldn't,be,moved,<END>
that's,the,first,time,i,ever,heard,of,a,yankee,doing,a,decent,thing,said,grandma,as,if,she,regretted,hearing,anything,good,about,the,invaders,<END>

i,have,a,private,word,for,this,child,<END>
help,me,down,the,steps,scarlett,<END>
young,miss,and,sally,said,good-by,and,promised,to,come,calling,soon,<END>
they,were,devoured,by,curiosity,as,to,what,grandma,had,to,say,to,scarlett,but,unless,she,chose,to,tell,them,they,would,never,know,<END>
old,ladies,were,so,difficult,young,miss,whispered,to,sally,as,they,went,back,to,their,sewing,<END>
scarlett,stood,with,her,hand,on,the,horse's,bridle,a,dull,feeling,at,her,heart,<END>
now,said,grandma,peering,into,her,face,what's,wrong,at,tara,<END>
what,are,you,keeping,back,<END>
scarlett,looked,up,into,the,keen,old,eyes,and,knew,she,could,tell,the,truth,without,tears,<END>
no,one,could,cry,in,the,presence,of,grandma,fontaine,without,her,express,permission,<END>
mother,is,dead,she,said,flatly,<END>
the,hand,on,her,arm,tightened,until,it,pinched,and,the,wrinkled,lids,over,the,yellow,eyes,blinked,<END>
did,the,yankees,kill,her,<END>
she,died,of,typhoid,<END>
died,the,day,before,i,came,home,<END>
don't,think,about,it,said,grandma,sternly,and,scarlett,saw,her,swallow,<END>
and,your,pa,<END>
pa,is,pa,is,not,himself,<END>
what,do,you,mean,<END>
speak,up,<END>
is,he,ill,<END>
the,shock,he,is,so,strange,he,is,not,<END>
don't,tell,me,he's,not,himself,<END>
do,you,mean,his,mind,is,unhinged,<END>
it,was,a,relief,to,hear,the,truth,put,so,baldly,<END>
how,good,the,old,lady,was,to,offer,no,sympathy,that,would,make,her,cry,<END>
yes,she,said,dully,he's,lost,his,mind,<END>
he,acts,dazed,and,sometimes,he,can't,seem,to,remember,that,mother,is,dead,<END>
oh,old,miss,it's,more,than,i,can,stand,to,see,him,sit,by,the,hour,waiting,for,her,and,so,patiently,too,and,he,used,to,have,no,more,patience,than,a,child,<END>
but,it's,worse,when,he,does,remember,that,she's,gone,<END>
every,now,and,then,after,he's,sat,still,with,his,ear,cocked,listening,for,her,he,jumps,up,suddenly,and,stumps,out,of,the,house,and,down,to,the,burying,ground,<END>
and,then,he,comes,dragging,back,with,the,tears,all,over,his,face,and,he,says,over,and,over,till,i,could,scream,'katie,scarlett,mrs,o'hara,is,dead,<END>
your,mother,is,dead,',and,it's,just,like,i,was,hearing,it,again,for,the,first,time,<END>
and,sometimes,late,at,night,i,hear,him,calling,her,and,i,get,out,of,bed,and,go,to,him,and,tell,him,she's,down,at,the,quarters,with,a,sick,darky,<END>
and,he,fusses,because,she's,always,tiring,herself,out,nursing,people,<END>
and,it's,so,hard,to,get,him,back,to,bed,<END>
he's,like,a,child,<END>
oh,i,wish,dr,fontaine,was,here,<END>
i,know,he,could,do,something,for,pa,<END>
and,melanie,needs,a,doctor,too,<END>
she,isn't,getting,over,her,baby,like,she,should,<END>
melly,a,baby,<END>
and,she's,with,you,<END>
yes,<END>
what's,melly,doing,with,you,<END>
why,isn't,she,in,macon,with,her,aunt,and,her,kinfolks,<END>
i,never,thought,you,liked,her,any,too,well,miss,for,all,she,was,charles',sister,<END>
now,tell,me,all,about,it,<END>
it's,a,long,story,old,miss,<END>
don't,you,want,to,go,back,in,the,house,and,sit,down,<END>
i,can,stand,said,grandma,shortly,<END>
and,if,you,told,your,story,in,front,of,the,others,they'd,be,bawling,and,making,you,feel,sorry,for,yourself,<END>
now,let's,have,it,<END>
scarlett,began,haltingly,with,the,siege,and,melanie's,condition,but,as,her,story,progressed,beneath,the,sharp,old,eyes,which,never,faltered,in,their,gaze,she,found,words,words,of,power,and,horror,<END>
it,all,came,back,to,her,the,sickeningly,hot,day,of,the,baby's,birth,the,agony,of,fear,the,flight,and,rhett's,desertion,<END>
she,spoke,of,the,wild,darkness,of,the,night,the,blazing,camp,fires,which,might,be,friends,or,foes,the,gaunt,chimneys,which,met,her,gaze,in,the,morning,sun,the,dead,men,and,horses,along,the,road,the,hunger,the,desolation,the,fear,that,tara,had,been,burned,<END>
i,thought,if,i,could,just,get,home,to,mother,she,could,manage,everything,and,i,could,lay,down,the,weary,load,<END>
on,the,way,home,i,thought,the,worst,had,already,happened,to,me,but,when,i,knew,she,was,dead,i,knew,what,the,worst,really,was,<END>
she,dropped,her,eyes,to,the,ground,and,waited,for,grandma,to,speak,<END>
the,silence,was,so,prolonged,she,wondered,if,grandma,could,have,failed,to,comprehend,her,desperate,plight,<END>
finally,the,old,voice,spoke,and,her,tones,were,kind,kinder,than,scarlett,had,ever,heard,her,use,in,addressing,anyone,<END>
child,it's,a,very,bad,thing,for,a,woman,to,face,the,worst,that,can,happen,to,her,because,after,she's,faced,the,worst,she,can't,ever,really,fear,anything,again,<END>
and,it's,very,bad,for,a,woman,not,to,be,afraid,of,something,<END>
you,think,i,don't,understand,what,you've,told,me,what,you've,been,through,<END>
well,i,understand,very,well,<END>
when,i,was,about,your,age,i,was,in,the,creek,uprising,right,after,the,fort,mims,massacre,yes,she,said,in,a,far-away,voice,just,about,your,age,for,that,was,fifty-odd,years,ago,<END>
and,i,managed,to,get,into,the,bushes,and,hide,and,i,lay,there,and,saw,our,house,burn,and,i,saw,the,indians,scalp,my,brothers,and,sisters,<END>
and,i,could,only,lie,there,and,pray,that,the,light,of,the,flames,wouldn't,show,up,my,hiding,place,<END>
and,they,dragged,mother,out,and,killed,her,about,twenty,feet,from,where,i,was,lying,<END>
and,scalped,her,too,<END>
and,ever,so,often,one,indian,would,go,back,to,her,and,sink,his,tommyhawk,into,her,skull,again,<END>
i,i,was,my,mother's,pet,and,i,lay,there,and,saw,it,all,<END>
and,in,the,morning,i,set,out,for,the,nearest,settlement,and,it,was,thirty,miles,away,<END>
it,took,me,three,days,to,get,there,through,the,swamps,and,the,indians,and,afterward,they,thought,i'd,lose,my,mind,<END>
that's,where,i,met,dr,fontaine,<END>
he,looked,after,me,<END>
ah,well,that's,been,fifty,years,ago,as,i,said,and,since,that,time,i've,never,been,afraid,of,anything,or,anybody,because,i'd,known,the,worst,that,could,happen,to,me,<END>
and,that,lack,of,fear,has,gotten,me,into,a,lot,of,trouble,and,cost,me,a,lot,of,happiness,<END>
god,intended,women,to,be,timid,frightened,creatures,and,there's,something,unnatural,about,a,woman,who,isn't,afraid,<END>
scarlett,always,save,something,to,fear,even,as,you,save,something,to,love,<END>
her,voice,trailed,off,and,she,stood,silent,with,eyes,looking,back,over,half,a,century,to,the,day,when,she,had,been,afraid,<END>
scarlett,moved,impatiently,<END>
she,had,thought,grandma,was,going,to,understand,and,perhaps,show,her,some,way,to,solve,her,problems,<END>
but,like,all,old,people,she'd,gotten,to,talking,about,things,that,happened,before,anyone,was,born,things,no,one,was,interested,in,<END>
scarlett,wished,she,had,not,confided,in,her,<END>
well,go,home,child,or,they'll,be,worrying,about,you,she,said,suddenly,<END>
send,pork,with,the,wagon,this,afternoon,<END>
and,don't,think,you,can,lay,down,the,load,ever,<END>
because,you,can't,<END>
i,know,<END>
indian,summer,lingered,into,november,that,year,and,the,warm,days,were,bright,days,for,those,at,tara,<END>
the,worst,was,over,<END>
they,had,a,horse,now,and,they,could,ride,instead,of,walk,<END>
they,had,fried,eggs,for,breakfast,and,fried,ham,for,supper,to,vary,the,monotony,of,the,yams,peanuts,and,dried,apples,and,on,one,festal,occasion,they,even,had,roast,chicken,<END>
the,old,sow,had,finally,been,captured,and,she,and,her,brood,rooted,and,grunted,happily,under,the,house,where,they,were,penned,<END>
sometimes,they,squealed,so,loudly,no,one,in,the,house,could,talk,but,it,was,a,pleasant,sound,<END>
it,meant,fresh,pork,for,the,white,folks,and,chitterlings,for,the,negroes,when,cold,weather,and,hog-killing,time,should,arrive,and,it,meant,food,for,the,winter,for,all,<END>
scarlett's,visit,to,the,fontaines,had,heartened,her,more,than,she,realized,<END>
just,the,knowledge,that,she,had,neighbors,that,some,of,the,family,friends,and,old,homes,had,survived,drove,out,the,terrible,loss,and,alone,feeling,which,had,oppressed,her,in,her,first,weeks,at,tara,<END>
and,the,fontaines,and,tarletons,whose,plantations,had,not,been,in,the,path,of,the,army,were,most,generous,in,sharing,what,little,they,had,<END>
it,was,the,tradition,of,the,county,that,neighbor,helped,neighbor,and,they,refused,to,accept,a,penny,from,scarlett,telling,her,that,she,would,do,the,same,for,them,and,she,could,pay,them,back,in,kind,next,year,when,tara,was,again,producing,<END>
scarlett,now,had,food,for,her,household,she,had,a,horse,she,had,the,money,and,jewelry,taken,from,the,yankee,straggler,and,the,greatest,need,was,new,clothing,<END>
she,knew,it,would,be,risky,business,sending,pork,south,to,buy,clothes,when,the,horse,might,be,captured,by,either,yankees,or,confederates,<END>
but,at,least,she,had,the,money,with,which,to,buy,the,clothes,a,horse,and,wagon,for,the,trip,and,perhaps,pork,could,make,the,trip,without,getting,caught,<END>
yes,the,worst,was,over,<END>
every,morning,when,scarlett,arose,she,thanked,god,for,the,pale-blue,sky,and,the,warm,sun,for,each,day,of,good,weather,put,off,the,inevitable,time,when,warm,clothing,would,be,needed,<END>
and,each,warm,day,saw,more,and,more,cotton,piling,up,in,the,empty,slave,quarters,the,only,storage,place,left,on,the,plantation,<END>
there,was,more,cotton,in,the,fields,than,she,or,pork,had,estimated,probably,four,bales,and,soon,the,cabins,would,be,full,<END>
scarlett,had,not,intended,to,do,any,cotton,picking,herself,even,after,grandma,fontaine's,tart,remark,<END>
it,was,unthinkable,that,she,an,o'hara,lady,now,the,mistress,of,tara,should,work,in,the,fields,<END>
it,put,her,on,the,same,level,with,the,snarly,haired,mrs,slattery,and,emmie,<END>
she,had,intended,that,the,negroes,should,do,the,field,work,while,she,and,the,convalescent,girls,attended,to,the,house,but,here,she,was,confronted,with,a,caste,feeling,even,stronger,than,her,own,<END>
pork,mammy,and,prissy,set,up,outcries,at,the,idea,of,working,in,the,fields,<END>
they,reiterated,that,they,were,house,niggers,not,field,hands,<END>
mammy,in,particular,declared,vehemently,that,she,had,never,even,been,a,yard,nigger,<END>
she,had,been,born,in,the,robillard,great,house,not,in,the,quarters,and,had,been,raised,in,ole,miss',bedroom,sleeping,on,a,pallet,at,the,foot,of,the,bed,<END>
dilcey,alone,said,nothing,and,she,fixed,her,prissy,with,an,unwinking,eye,that,made,her,squirm,<END>
scarlett,refused,to,listen,to,the,protests,and,drove,them,all,into,the,cotton,rows,<END>
but,mammy,and,pork,worked,so,slowly,and,with,so,many,lamentations,that,scarlett,sent,mammy,back,to,the,kitchen,to,cook,and,pork,to,the,woods,and,the,river,with,snares,for,rabbits,and,possums,and,lines,for,fish,<END>
cotton,picking,was,beneath,pork's,dignity,but,hunting,and,fishing,were,not,<END>
scarlett,next,had,tried,her,sisters,and,melanie,in,the,fields,but,that,had,worked,no,better,<END>
melanie,had,picked,neatly,quickly,and,willingly,for,an,hour,in,the,hot,sun,and,then,fainted,quietly,and,had,to,stay,in,bed,for,a,week,<END>
suellen,sullen,and,tearful,pretended,to,faint,too,but,came,back,to,consciousness,spitting,like,an,angry,cat,when,scarlett,poured,a,gourdful,of,water,in,her,face,<END>
finally,she,refused,point-blank,<END>
i,won't,work,in,the,fields,like,a,darky,<END>
you,can't,make,me,<END>
what,if,any,of,our,friends,ever,heard,of,it,<END>
what,if,if,mr,kennedy,ever,knew,<END>
oh,if,mother,knew,about,this,<END>
you,just,mention,mother's,name,once,more,suellen,o'hara,and,i'll,slap,you,flat,cried,scarlett,<END>
mother,worked,harder,than,any,darky,on,this,place,and,you,know,it,miss,fine,airs,<END>
she,did,not,<END>
at,least,not,in,the,fields,<END>
and,you,can't,make,me,<END>
i'll,tell,papa,on,you,and,he,won't,make,me,work,<END>
don't,you,dare,go,bothering,pa,with,any,of,our,troubles,<END>
cried,scarlett,distracted,between,indignation,at,her,sister,and,fear,for,gerald,<END>
i'll,help,you,sissy,interposed,carreen,docilely,<END>
i'll,work,for,sue,and,me,too,<END>
she,isn't,well,yet,and,she,shouldn't,be,out,in,the,sun,<END>
scarlett,said,gratefully,thank,you,sugarbaby,but,looked,worriedly,at,her,younger,sister,<END>
carreen,who,had,always,been,as,delicately,pink,and,white,as,the,orchard,blossoms,that,are,scattered,by,the,spring,wind,was,no,longer,pink,but,still,conveyed,in,her,sweet,thoughtful,face,a,blossomlike,quality,<END>
she,had,been,silent,a,little,dazed,since,she,came,back,to,consciousness,and,found,ellen,gone,scarlett,a,termagant,the,world,changed,and,unceasing,labor,the,order,of,the,new,day,<END>
it,was,not,in,carreen's,delicate,nature,to,adjust,herself,to,change,<END>
she,simply,could,not,comprehend,what,had,happened,and,she,went,about,tara,like,a,sleepwalker,doing,exactly,what,she,was,told,<END>
she,looked,and,was,frail,but,she,was,willing,obedient,and,obliging,<END>
when,she,was,not,doing,scarlett's,bidding,her,rosary,beads,were,always,in,her,hands,and,her,lips,moving,in,prayers,for,her,mother,and,for,brent,tarleton,<END>
it,did,not,occur,to,scarlett,that,carreen,had,taken,brent's,death,so,seriously,and,that,her,grief,was,unhealed,<END>
to,scarlet,carreen,was,still,baby,sister,far,too,young,to,have,had,a,really,serious,love,affair,<END>
scarlett,standing,in,the,sun,in,the,cotton,rows,her,back,breaking,from,the,eternal,bending,and,her,hands,roughened,by,the,dry,bolls,wished,she,had,a,sister,who,combined,suellen's,energy,and,strength,with,carreen's,sweet,disposition,<END>
for,carreen,picked,diligently,and,earnestly,<END>
but,after,she,had,labored,for,an,hour,it,was,obvious,that,she,and,not,suellen,was,the,one,not,yet,well,enough,for,such,work,<END>
so,scarlett,sent,carreen,back,to,the,house,too,<END>
there,remained,with,her,now,in,the,long,rows,only,dilcey,and,prissy,<END>
prissy,picked,lazily,spasmodically,complaining,of,her,feet,her,back,her,internal,miseries,her,complete,weariness,until,her,mother,took,a,cotton,stalk,to,her,and,whipped,her,until,she,screamed,<END>
after,that,she,worked,a,little,better,taking,care,to,stay,far,from,her,mother's,reach,<END>
dilcey,worked,tirelessly,silently,like,a,machine,and,scarlett,with,her,back,aching,and,her,shoulder,raw,from,the,tugging,weight,of,the,cotton,bag,she,carried,thought,that,dilcey,was,worth,her,weight,in,gold,<END>
dilcey,she,said,when,good,times,come,back,i'm,not,going,to,forget,how,you've,acted,<END>
you've,been,mighty,good,<END>
the,bronze,giantess,did,not,grin,pleasedly,or,squirm,under,praise,like,the,other,negroes,<END>
she,turned,an,immobile,face,to,scarlett,and,said,with,dignity,thankee,ma'm,<END>
but,mist',gerald,and,miss,ellen,been,good,to,me,<END>
mist',gerald,buy,my,prissy,so,i,wouldn',grieve,and,i,doan,forgit,it,<END>
i,is,part,indian,and,indians,doan,forgit,them,as,is,good,to,them,<END>
i,sorry,'bout,my,prissy,<END>
she,mighty,wuthless,<END>
look,lak,she,all,nigger,lak,her,pa,her,pa,was,mighty,flighty,<END>
in,spite,of,scarlett's,problem,of,getting,help,from,the,others,in,the,picking,and,in,spite,of,the,weariness,of,doing,the,labor,herself,her,spirits,lifted,as,the,cotton,slowly,made,its,way,from,the,fields,to,the,cabins,<END>
there,was,something,about,cotton,that,was,reassuring,steadying,<END>
tara,had,risen,to,riches,on,cotton,even,as,the,whole,south,had,risen,and,scarlett,was,southerner,enough,to,believe,that,both,tara,and,the,south,would,rise,again,out,of,the,red,fields,<END>
of,course,this,little,cotton,she,had,gathered,was,not,much,but,it,was,something,<END>
it,would,bring,a,little,in,confederate,money,and,that,little,would,help,her,to,save,the,hoarded,greenbacks,and,gold,in,the,yankee's,wallet,until,they,had,to,be,spent,<END>
next,spring,she,would,try,to,make,the,confederate,government,send,back,big,sam,and,the,other,field,hands,they,had,commandeered,and,if,the,government,wouldn't,release,them,she'd,use,the,yankee's,money,to,hire,field,hands,from,the,neighbors,<END>
next,spring,she,would,plant,and,plant,<END>
she,straightened,her,tired,back,and,looking,over,the,browning,autumn,fields,she,saw,next,year's,crop,standing,sturdy,and,green,acre,upon,acre,<END>
next,spring,<END>
perhaps,by,next,spring,the,war,would,be,over,and,good,times,would,be,back,<END>
and,whether,the,confederacy,won,or,lost,times,would,be,better,<END>
anything,was,better,than,the,constant,danger,of,raids,from,both,armies,<END>
when,the,war,was,over,a,plantation,could,earn,an,honest,living,<END>
oh,if,the,war,were,only,over,<END>
then,people,could,plant,crops,with,some,certainty,of,reaping,them,<END>
there,was,hope,now,<END>
the,war,couldn't,last,forever,<END>
she,had,her,little,cotton,she,had,food,she,had,a,horse,she,had,her,small,but,treasured,hoard,of,money,<END>
yes,the,worst,was,over,<END>
chapter,xxvii,<END>
on,a,noonday,in,mid-november,they,all,sat,grouped,about,the,dinner,table,eating,the,last,of,the,dessert,concocted,by,mammy,from,corn,meal,and,dried,huckleberries,sweetened,with,sorghum,<END>
there,was,a,chill,in,the,air,the,first,chill,of,the,year,and,pork,standing,behind,scarlett's,chair,rubbed,his,hands,together,in,glee,and,questioned,ain',it,'bout,time,fer,de,hawg,killin',miss,scarlett,<END>
you,can,taste,those,chitlins,already,can't,you,<END>
said,scarlett,with,a,grin,<END>

melanie,interrupted,her,spoon,at,her,lips,<END>

somebody's,coming,<END>
somebody,hollerin',said,pork,uneasily,<END>
on,the,crisp,autumn,air,came,clear,the,sound,of,horse's,hooves,thudding,as,swiftly,as,a,frightened,heart,and,a,woman's,voice,high,pitched,screaming,scarlett,<END>
scarlett,<END>
eye,met,eye,for,a,dreadful,second,around,the,table,before,chairs,were,pushed,back,and,everyone,leaped,up,<END>
despite,the,fear,that,made,it,shrill,they,recognized,the,voice,of,sally,fontaine,who,only,an,hour,before,had,stopped,at,tara,for,a,brief,chat,on,her,way,to,jonesboro,<END>
now,as,they,all,rushed,pell-mell,to,crowd,the,front,door,they,saw,her,coming,up,the,drive,like,the,wind,on,a,lathered,horse,her,hair,streaming,behind,her,her,bonnet,dangling,by,its,ribbons,<END>
she,did,not,draw,rein,but,as,she,galloped,madly,toward,them,she,waved,her,arm,back,in,the,direction,from,which,she,had,come,<END>

i,saw,them,<END>
down,the,road,<END>
the,yankees,<END>

he,swung,around,sharply,covered,the,side,lawn,in,three,leaps,and,she,put,him,across,the,four-foot,hedge,as,if,she,were,on,the,hunting,field,<END>
they,heard,the,heavy,pounding,of,his,hooves,as,he,went,through,the,back,yard,and,down,the,narrow,lane,between,the,cabins,of,the,quarters,and,knew,she,was,cutting,across,the,fields,to,mimosa,<END>
for,a,moment,they,stood,paralyzed,and,then,suellen,and,carreen,began,to,sob,and,clutch,each,other's,fingers,<END>

i,shall,die,right,here,<END>

her,horse,<END>
her,only,horse,<END>

they'd,take,everything,and,leave,them,to,starve,<END>

she,stopped,and,wrung,her,hands,and,the,frightened,sobbing,of,little,wade,who,was,clutching,melanie's,skirt,added,to,her,panic,<END>
what,shall,i,do,scarlett,<END>
melanie's,voice,was,calm,amid,the,wailing,and,tears,and,scurrying,feet,<END>
though,her,face,was,paper,white,and,her,whole,body,trembled,the,very,quietness,of,her,voice,steadied,scarlett,revealing,to,her,that,they,all,looked,to,her,for,commands,for,guidance,<END>
the,cow,and,the,calf,she,said,quickly,<END>
they're,in,the,old,pasture,<END>
take,the,horse,and,drive,them,into,the,swamp,and,<END>
before,she,could,finish,her,sentence,melanie,shook,off,wade's,clutches,and,was,down,the,front,steps,and,running,toward,the,horse,pulling,up,her,wide,skirts,as,she,ran,<END>
scarlett,caught,a,flashing,glimpse,of,thin,legs,a,flurry,of,skirts,and,underclothing,and,melanie,was,in,the,saddle,her,feet,dangling,far,above,the,stirrups,<END>
she,gathered,up,the,reins,and,clapped,her,heels,against,the,animal's,sides,and,then,abruptly,pulled,him,in,her,face,twisting,with,horror,<END>
my,baby,<END>
she,cried,<END>
oh,my,baby,<END>
the,yankees,will,kill,him,<END>

her,hand,was,on,the,pommel,and,she,was,preparing,to,slide,off,but,scarlett,screamed,at,her,<END>

melly,looked,despairingly,backward,but,hammered,her,heels,into,the,horse,and,with,a,scattering,of,gravel,was,off,down,the,drive,toward,the,pasture,<END>
scarlett,thought,i,never,expected,to,see,melly,hamilton,straddling,a,horse,<END>
and,then,she,ran,into,the,house,<END>
wade,was,at,her,heels,sobbing,trying,to,catch,her,flying,skirts,<END>
as,she,went,up,the,steps,three,at,a,bound,she,saw,suellen,and,carreen,with,split-oak,baskets,on,their,arms,running,toward,the,pantry,and,pork,tugging,none,too,gently,at,gerald's,arm,dragging,him,toward,the,back,porch,<END>
gerald,was,mumbling,querulously,and,pulling,away,like,a,child,<END>

and,i,thought,it,was,such,a,good,idea,to,keep,the,pigs,under,the,house,so,nobody,could,steal,them,thought,scarlett,running,into,her,room,<END>
why,oh,why,didn't,i,build,a,pen,for,them,down,in,the,swamp,<END>
she,tore,open,her,top,bureau,drawer,and,scratched,about,in,the,clothing,until,the,yankee's,wallet,was,in,her,hand,<END>
hastily,she,picked,up,the,solitaire,ring,and,the,diamond,earbobs,from,where,she,had,hidden,them,in,her,sewing,basket,and,shoved,them,into,the,wallet,<END>
but,where,to,hide,it,<END>
in,the,mattress,<END>
up,the,chimney,<END>
throw,it,in,the,well,<END>
put,it,in,her,bosom,<END>
no,never,there,<END>
the,outlines,of,the,wallet,might,show,through,her,basque,and,if,the,yankees,saw,it,they,would,strip,her,naked,and,search,her,<END>
i,shall,die,if,they,do,<END>
she,thought,wildly,<END>
downstairs,there,was,a,pandemonium,of,racing,feet,and,sobbing,voices,<END>
even,in,her,frenzy,scarlett,wished,she,had,melanie,with,her,melly,with,her,quiet,voice,melly,who,was,so,brave,the,day,she,shot,the,yankee,<END>
melly,was,worth,three,of,the,others,<END>
melly,what,had,melly,said,<END>
oh,yes,the,baby,<END>
clutching,the,wallet,to,her,scarlett,ran,across,the,hall,to,the,room,where,little,beau,was,sleeping,in,the,low,cradle,<END>
she,snatched,him,up,into,her,arms,and,he,awoke,waving,small,fists,and,slobbering,sleepily,<END>
she,heard,suellen,crying,come,on,carreen,<END>
come,on,<END>
we've,got,enough,<END>
oh,sister,hurry,<END>
there,were,wild,squealings,indignant,gruntings,in,the,back,yard,and,running,to,the,widow,scarlett,saw,mammy,waddling,hurriedly,across,the,cotton,field,with,a,struggling,young,pig,under,each,arm,<END>
behind,her,was,pork,also,carrying,two,pigs,and,pushing,gerald,before,him,<END>
gerald,was,stumping,across,the,furrows,waving,his,cane,<END>
leaning,out,of,the,window,scarlett,yelled,get,the,sow,dilcey,<END>
make,prissy,drive,her,out,<END>
you,can,chase,her,across,the,fields,<END>
dilcey,looked,up,her,bronzed,face,harassed,<END>
in,her,apron,was,a,pile,of,silver,tableware,<END>
she,pointed,under,the,house,<END>
the,sow,done,bit,prissy,and,got,her,penned,up,unner,the,house,<END>
good,for,the,sow,thought,scarlett,<END>
she,hurried,back,into,her,room,and,hastily,gathered,from,their,hiding,place,the,bracelets,brooch,miniature,and,cup,she,had,found,on,the,dead,yankee,<END>
but,where,to,hide,them,<END>
it,was,awkward,carrying,little,beau,in,one,arm,and,the,wallet,and,the,trinkets,in,the,other,<END>
she,started,to,lay,him,on,the,bed,<END>
he,set,up,a,wail,at,leaving,her,arms,and,a,welcome,thought,came,to,her,<END>
what,better,hiding,place,could,there,be,than,a,baby's,diaper,<END>
she,quickly,turned,him,over,pulled,up,his,dress,and,thrust,the,wallet,down,the,diaper,next,to,his,backside,<END>
he,yelled,louder,at,this,treatment,and,she,hastily,tightened,the,triangular,garment,about,his,threshing,legs,<END>
now,she,thought,drawing,a,deep,breath,now,for,the,swamp,<END>
tucking,him,screaming,under,one,arm,and,clutching,the,jewelry,to,her,with,the,other,she,raced,into,the,upstairs,hall,<END>
suddenly,her,rapid,steps,paused,fright,weakening,her,knees,<END>
how,silent,the,house,was,<END>
how,dreadfully,still,<END>
had,they,all,gone,off,and,left,her,<END>
hadn't,anyone,waited,for,her,<END>
she,hadn't,meant,for,them,to,leave,her,here,alone,<END>
these,days,anything,could,happen,to,a,lone,woman,and,with,the,yankees,coming,<END>
she,jumped,as,a,slight,noise,sounded,and,turning,quickly,saw,crouched,by,the,banisters,her,forgotten,son,his,eyes,enormous,with,terror,<END>
he,tried,to,speak,but,his,throat,only,worked,silently,<END>
get,up,wade,hampton,she,commanded,swiftly,<END>
get,up,and,walk,<END>
mother,can't,carry,you,now,<END>
he,ran,to,her,like,a,small,frightened,animal,and,clutching,her,wide,skirt,buried,his,face,in,it,<END>
she,could,feel,his,small,hands,groping,through,the,folds,for,her,legs,<END>
she,started,down,the,stairs,each,step,hampered,by,wade's,dragging,hands,and,she,said,fiercely,turn,me,loose,wade,<END>
turn,me,loose,and,walk,<END>
but,the,child,only,clung,the,closer,<END>
as,she,reached,the,landing,the,whole,lower,floor,leaped,up,at,her,<END>
all,the,homely,well-loved,articles,of,furniture,seemed,to,whisper,good-by,<END>
good-by,<END>
a,sob,rose,in,her,throat,<END>
there,was,the,open,door,of,the,office,where,ellen,had,labored,so,diligently,and,she,could,glimpse,a,corner,of,the,old,secretary,<END>
there,was,the,dining,room,with,chairs,pushed,awry,and,food,still,on,the,plates,<END>
there,on,the,floor,were,the,rag,rugs,ellen,had,dyed,and,woven,herself,<END>
and,there,was,the,old,portrait,of,grandma,robillard,with,bosoms,half,bared,hair,piled,high,and,nostrils,cut,so,deeply,as,to,give,her,face,a,perpetual,well-bred,sneer,<END>
everything,which,had,been,part,of,her,earliest,memories,everything,bound,up,with,the,deepest,roots,in,her,good-by,<END>
good-by,scarlett,o'hara,<END>
the,yankees,would,burn,it,all,all,<END>
this,was,her,last,view,of,home,her,last,view,except,what,she,might,see,from,the,cover,of,the,woods,or,the,swamp,the,tall,chimneys,wrapped,in,smoke,the,roof,crashing,in,flame,<END>
i,can't,leave,you,she,thought,and,her,teeth,chattered,with,fear,<END>
i,can't,leave,you,<END>
pa,wouldn't,leave,you,<END>
he,told,them,they'd,have,to,burn,you,over,his,head,<END>
then,they'll,burn,you,over,my,head,for,i,can't,leave,you,either,<END>
you're,all,i've,got,left,<END>
with,the,decision,some,of,her,fear,fell,away,and,there,remained,only,a,congealed,feeling,in,her,breast,as,if,all,hope,and,fear,had,frozen,<END>
as,she,stood,there,she,heard,from,the,avenue,the,sound,of,many,horses',feet,the,jingle,of,bridle,bits,and,sabers,rattling,in,scabbards,and,a,harsh,voice,crying,a,command,dismount,<END>
swiftly,she,bent,to,the,child,beside,her,and,her,voice,was,urgent,but,oddly,gentle,<END>
turn,me,loose,wade,honey,<END>
you,run,down,the,stairs,quick,and,through,the,back,yard,toward,the,swamp,<END>
mammy,will,be,there,and,aunt,melly,<END>
run,quickly,darling,and,don't,be,afraid,<END>
at,the,change,in,her,tone,the,boy,looked,up,and,scarlett,was,appalled,at,the,look,in,his,eyes,like,a,baby,rabbit,in,a,trap,<END>
oh,mother,of,god,<END>
she,prayed,<END>
don't,let,him,have,a,convulsion,<END>
not,not,before,the,yankees,<END>
they,mustn't,know,we,are,afraid,<END>
and,as,the,child,only,gripped,her,skirt,the,tighter,she,said,clearly,be,a,little,man,wade,<END>
they're,only,a,passel,of,damn,yankees,<END>
and,she,went,down,the,steps,to,meet,them,<END>
sherman,was,marching,through,georgia,from,atlanta,to,the,sea,<END>
behind,him,lay,the,smoking,ruins,of,atlanta,to,which,the,torch,had,been,set,as,the,blue,army,tramped,out,<END>
before,him,lay,three,hundred,miles,of,territory,virtually,undefended,save,by,a,few,state,militia,and,the,old,men,and,young,boys,of,the,home,guard,<END>
here,lay,the,fertile,state,dotted,with,plantations,sheltering,the,women,and,children,the,very,old,and,the,negroes,<END>
in,a,swath,eighty,miles,wide,the,yankees,were,looting,and,burning,<END>
there,were,hundreds,of,homes,in,flames,hundreds,of,homes,resounding,with,their,footsteps,<END>
but,to,scarlett,watching,the,bluecoats,pour,into,the,front,hall,it,was,not,a,countrywide,affair,<END>
it,was,entirely,personal,a,malicious,action,aimed,directly,at,her,and,hers,<END>
she,stood,at,the,foot,of,the,stairs,the,baby,in,her,arms,wade,pressed,tightly,against,her,his,head,hidden,in,her,skirts,as,the,yankees,swarmed,through,the,house,pushing,roughly,past,her,up,the,stairs,dragging,furniture,onto,the,front,porch,running,bayonets,and,knives,into,upholstery,and,digging,inside,for,concealed,valuables,<END>
upstairs,they,were,ripping,open,mattresses,and,feather,beds,until,the,air,in,the,hall,was,thick,with,feathers,that,floated,softly,down,on,her,head,<END>
impotent,rage,quelled,what,little,fear,was,left,in,her,heart,as,she,stood,helpless,while,they,plundered,and,stole,and,ruined,<END>
the,sergeant,in,charge,was,a,bow-legged,grizzled,little,man,with,a,large,wad,of,tobacco,in,his,cheek,<END>
he,reached,scarlett,before,any,of,his,men,and,spitting,freely,on,the,floor,and,her,skirts,said,briefly,<END>
lemme,have,what,you,got,in,yore,hand,lady,<END>
she,had,forgotten,the,trinkets,she,had,intended,to,hide,and,with,a,sneer,which,she,hoped,was,as,eloquent,as,that,pictured,on,grandma,robillard's,face,she,flung,the,articles,to,the,floor,and,almost,enjoyed,the,rapacious,scramble,that,ensued,<END>
i'll,trouble,you,for,thet,ring,and,them,earbobs,<END>
scarlett,tucked,the,baby,more,securely,under,her,arm,so,that,he,hung,face,downward,crimson,and,screaming,and,removed,the,garnet,earrings,which,had,been,gerald's,wedding,present,to,ellen,<END>
then,she,stripped,off,the,large,sapphire,solitaire,which,charles,had,given,her,as,an,engagement,ring,<END>
don't,throw,um,<END>
hand,um,to,me,said,the,sergeant,putting,out,his,hands,<END>
them,bastards,got,enough,already,<END>
what,else,have,you,got,<END>
his,eyes,went,over,her,basque,sharply,<END>
for,a,moment,scarlett,went,faint,already,feeling,rough,hands,thrusting,themselves,into,her,bosom,fumbling,at,her,garters,<END>
that,is,all,but,i,suppose,it,is,customary,to,strip,your,victims,<END>
oh,i'll,take,your,word,said,the,sergeant,good-naturedly,spitting,again,as,he,turned,away,<END>
scarlett,righted,the,baby,and,tried,to,soothe,him,holding,her,hand,over,the,place,on,the,diaper,where,the,wallet,was,hidden,thanking,god,that,melanie,had,a,baby,and,that,baby,had,a,diaper,<END>
upstairs,she,could,hear,heavy,boots,trampling,the,protesting,screech,of,furniture,pulled,across,the,floor,the,crashing,of,china,and,mirrors,the,curses,when,nothing,of,value,appeared,<END>
from,the,yard,came,loud,cries,head,um,off,<END>
don't,let,um,get,away,<END>
and,the,despairing,squawks,of,the,hens,and,quacking,and,honking,of,the,ducks,and,geese,<END>
a,pang,went,through,her,as,she,heard,an,agonized,squealing,which,was,suddenly,stilled,by,a,pistol,shot,and,she,knew,that,the,sow,was,dead,<END>
damn,prissy,<END>
she,had,run,off,and,left,her,<END>
if,only,the,shoats,were,safe,<END>
if,only,the,family,had,gotten,safely,to,the,swamp,<END>
but,there,was,no,way,of,knowing,<END>
she,stood,quietly,in,the,hall,while,the,soldiers,boiled,about,her,shouting,and,cursing,<END>
wade's,fingers,were,in,her,skirt,in,a,terrified,grip,<END>
she,could,feel,his,body,shaking,as,he,pressed,against,her,but,she,could,not,bring,herself,to,speak,reassuringly,to,him,<END>
she,could,not,bring,herself,to,utter,any,word,to,the,yankees,either,of,pleading,protest,or,anger,<END>
she,could,only,thank,god,that,her,knees,still,had,the,strength,to,support,her,that,her,neck,was,still,strong,enough,to,hold,her,head,high,<END>
but,when,a,squad,of,bearded,men,came,lumbering,down,the,steps,laden,with,an,assortment,of,stolen,articles,and,she,saw,charles',sword,in,the,hands,of,one,she,did,cry,out,<END>
that,sword,was,wade's,<END>
it,had,been,his,father's,and,his,grandfather's,sword,and,scarlett,had,given,it,to,the,little,boy,on,his,last,birthday,<END>
they,had,made,quite,a,ceremony,of,it,and,melanie,had,cried,cried,with,tears,of,pride,and,sorrowful,memory,and,kissed,him,and,said,he,must,grow,up,to,be,a,brave,soldier,like,his,father,and,his,grandfather,<END>
wade,was,very,proud,of,it,and,often,climbed,upon,the,table,beneath,where,it,hung,to,pat,it,<END>
scarlett,could,endure,seeing,her,own,possessions,going,out,of,the,house,in,hateful,alien,hands,but,not,this,not,her,little,boy's,pride,<END>
wade,peering,from,the,protection,of,her,skirts,at,the,sound,of,her,cry,found,speech,and,courage,in,a,mighty,sob,<END>
stretching,out,one,hand,he,cried,<END>
mine,<END>
you,can't,take,that,<END>
said,scarlett,swiftly,holding,out,her,hand,too,<END>
i,can't,hey,<END>

the,sergeant,pleased,at,his,promotion,stepped,forward,<END>
lemme,see,thet,sword,bub,he,said,<END>
reluctantly,the,little,trooper,handed,it,to,him,<END>
it's,got,a,solid-gold,hilt,he,said,<END>
the,sergeant,turned,it,in,his,hand,held,the,hilt,up,to,the,sunlight,to,read,the,engraved,inscription,<END>

well,he,can,have,it,said,the,sergeant,who,was,satisfied,enough,with,the,jewelry,and,trinkets,tied,up,in,his,handkerchief,<END>
but,it's,got,a,solid-gold,hilt,insisted,the,little,trooper,<END>
we'll,leave,her,thet,to,remember,us,by,grinned,the,sergeant,<END>
scarlett,took,the,sword,not,even,saying,thank,you,<END>
why,should,she,thank,these,thieves,for,returning,her,own,property,to,her,<END>

by,god,i'll,give,these,damn,rebels,something,to,remember,me,by,shouted,the,private,finally,when,the,sergeant,losing,his,good,nature,told,him,to,go,to,hell,and,not,talk,back,<END>
the,little,man,went,charging,toward,the,back,of,the,house,and,scarlett,breathed,more,easily,<END>
they,had,said,nothing,about,burning,the,house,<END>
they,hadn't,told,her,to,leave,so,they,could,fire,it,<END>
perhaps,perhaps,the,men,came,rambling,into,the,hall,from,the,upstairs,and,the,out,of,doors,<END>
anything,<END>

all,for,nothing,<END>

we,were,in,this,neighborhood,in,september,said,one,of,the,men,turning,something,in,his,hand,<END>
i'd,forgot,<END>
scarlett,saw,it,was,ellen's,gold,thimble,that,he,held,<END>
how,often,she,had,seen,it,gleaming,in,and,out,of,ellen's,fancy,work,<END>
the,sight,of,it,brought,back,too,many,hurting,memories,of,the,slender,hand,which,had,worn,it,<END>
there,it,lay,in,this,stranger's,calloused,dirty,palm,and,soon,it,would,find,its,way,north,and,onto,the,finger,of,some,yankee,woman,who,would,be,proud,to,wear,stolen,things,<END>
ellen's,thimble,<END>
scarlett,dropped,her,head,so,the,enemy,could,not,see,her,cry,and,the,tears,fell,slowly,down,on,the,baby's,head,<END>
through,the,blur,she,saw,the,men,moving,toward,the,doorway,heard,the,sergeant,calling,commands,in,a,loud,rough,voice,<END>
they,were,going,and,tara,was,safe,but,with,the,pain,of,ellen's,memory,on,her,she,was,hardly,glad,<END>
the,sound,of,the,banging,sabers,and,horses',hooves,brought,little,relief,and,she,stood,suddenly,weak,and,nerveless,as,they,moved,off,down,the,avenue,every,man,laden,with,stolen,goods,clothing,blankets,pictures,hens,and,ducks,the,sow,<END>
then,to,her,nostrils,was,borne,the,smell,of,smoke,and,she,turned,too,weak,with,lessening,strain,to,care,about,the,cotton,<END>
through,the,open,windows,of,the,dining,room,she,saw,smoke,drifting,lazily,out,of,the,negro,cabins,<END>
there,went,the,cotton,<END>
there,went,the,tax,money,and,part,of,the,money,which,was,to,see,them,through,this,bitter,winter,<END>
there,was,nothing,she,could,do,about,it,either,except,watch,<END>
she,had,seen,fires,in,cotton,before,and,she,knew,how,difficult,they,were,to,put,out,even,with,many,men,laboring,at,it,<END>
thank,god,the,quarters,were,so,far,from,the,house,<END>
thank,god,there,was,no,wind,today,to,carry,sparks,to,the,roof,of,tara,<END>
suddenly,she,swung,about,rigid,as,a,pointer,and,stared,with,horror-struck,eyes,down,the,hall,down,the,covered,passageway,toward,the,kitchen,<END>
there,was,smoke,coming,from,the,kitchen,<END>
somewhere,between,the,hall,and,the,kitchen,she,laid,the,baby,down,<END>
somewhere,she,flung,off,wade's,grip,slinging,him,against,the,wall,<END>
she,burst,into,the,smoke-filled,kitchen,and,reeled,back,coughing,her,eyes,streaming,tears,from,the,smoke,<END>
again,she,plunged,in,her,skirt,held,over,her,nose,<END>
the,room,was,dark,lit,as,it,was,by,one,small,window,and,so,thick,with,smoke,that,she,was,blinded,but,she,could,hear,the,hiss,and,crackle,of,flames,<END>
dashing,a,hand,across,her,eyes,she,peered,squinting,and,saw,thin,lines,of,flame,creeping,across,the,kitchen,floor,toward,the,walls,<END>
someone,had,scattered,the,blazing,logs,in,the,open,fireplace,across,the,whole,room,and,the,tinder-dry,pine,floor,was,sucking,in,the,flames,and,spewing,them,up,like,water,<END>
back,she,rushed,to,the,dining,room,and,snatched,a,rag,rug,from,the,floor,spilling,two,chairs,with,a,crash,<END>
i'll,never,beat,it,out,never,never,<END>
oh,god,if,only,there,was,someone,to,help,<END>
tara,is,gone,gone,<END>
oh,god,<END>
this,was,what,that,little,wretch,meant,when,he,said,he'd,give,me,something,to,remember,him,by,<END>
oh,if,i'd,only,let,him,have,the,sword,<END>
in,the,hallway,she,passed,her,son,lying,in,the,corner,with,his,sword,<END>
his,eyes,were,closed,and,his,face,had,a,look,of,slack,unearthly,peace,<END>
my,god,<END>
he's,dead,<END>
they've,frightened,him,to,death,<END>
she,thought,in,agony,but,she,raced,by,him,to,the,bucket,of,drinking,water,which,always,stood,in,the,passageway,by,the,kitchen,door,<END>
she,soused,the,end,of,the,rug,into,the,bucket,and,drawing,a,deep,breath,plunged,again,into,the,smoke-filled,room,slamming,the,door,behind,her,<END>
for,an,eternity,she,reeled,and,coughed,beating,the,rug,against,the,lines,of,fire,that,shot,swiftly,beyond,her,<END>
twice,her,long,skirt,took,fire,and,she,slapped,it,out,with,her,hands,<END>
she,could,smell,the,sickening,smell,of,her,hair,scorching,as,it,came,loose,from,its,pins,and,swept,about,her,shoulders,<END>
the,flames,raced,ever,beyond,her,toward,the,walls,of,the,covered,runway,fiery,snakes,that,writhed,and,leaped,and,exhaustion,sweeping,her,she,knew,that,it,was,hopeless,<END>
then,the,door,swung,open,and,the,sucking,draft,flung,the,flames,higher,<END>
it,closed,with,a,bang,and,in,the,swirling,smoke,scarlett,half,blind,saw,melanie,stamping,her,feet,on,the,flames,beating,at,them,with,something,dark,and,heavy,<END>
she,saw,her,staggering,heard,her,coughing,caught,a,lightning-flash,glimpse,of,her,set,white,face,and,eyes,narrow,to,slits,against,the,smoke,saw,her,small,body,curving,back,and,forth,as,she,swung,her,rug,up,and,down,<END>
for,another,eternity,they,fought,and,swayed,side,by,side,and,scarlett,could,see,that,the,lines,of,fire,were,shortening,<END>
then,suddenly,melanie,turned,toward,her,and,with,a,cry,hit,her,across,the,shoulders,with,all,her,might,<END>
scarlett,went,down,in,a,whirlwind,of,smoke,and,darkness,<END>
when,she,opened,her,eyes,she,was,lying,on,the,back,porch,her,head,pillowed,comfortably,on,melanie's,lap,and,the,afternoon,sunlight,was,shining,on,her,face,<END>
her,hands,face,and,shoulders,smarted,intolerably,from,burns,<END>
smoke,was,still,rolling,from,the,quarters,enveloping,the,cabins,in,thick,clouds,and,the,smell,of,burning,cotton,was,strong,<END>
scarlett,saw,wisps,of,smoke,drifting,from,the,kitchen,and,she,stirred,frantically,to,rise,<END>
but,she,was,pushed,back,as,melanie's,calm,voice,said,lie,still,dear,<END>
the,fire's,out,<END>
she,lay,quiet,for,a,moment,eyes,closed,sighing,with,relief,and,heard,the,slobbery,gurgle,of,the,baby,near,by,and,the,reassuring,sound,of,wade's,hiccoughing,<END>
so,he,wasn't,dead,thank,god,<END>
she,opened,her,eyes,and,looked,up,into,melanie's,face,<END>
her,curls,were,singed,her,face,black,with,smut,but,her,eyes,were,sparkling,with,excitement,and,she,was,smiling,<END>
you,look,like,a,nigger,murmured,scarlett,burrowing,her,head,wearily,into,its,soft,pillow,<END>
and,you,look,like,the,end,man,in,a,minstrel,show,replied,melanie,equably,<END>
why,did,you,have,to,hit,me,<END>
because,my,darling,your,back,was,on,fire,<END>
i,didn't,dream,you'd,faint,though,the,lord,knows,you've,had,enough,today,to,kill,you,<END>
i,came,back,as,soon,as,i,got,the,stock,safe,in,the,woods,<END>
i,nearly,died,thinking,about,you,and,the,baby,alone,<END>
did,the,yankees,harm,you,<END>
if,you,mean,did,they,rape,me,no,said,scarlett,groaning,as,she,tried,to,sit,up,<END>
though,melanie's,lap,was,soft,the,porch,on,which,she,was,lying,was,far,from,comfortable,<END>
but,they've,stolen,everything,everything,<END>
we've,lost,everything,well,what,is,there,to,look,so,happy,about,<END>
we,haven't,lost,each,other,and,our,babies,are,all,right,and,we,have,a,roof,over,our,heads,said,melanie,and,there,was,a,lilt,in,her,voice,<END>
and,that's,all,anyone,can,hope,for,now,<END>
goodness,but,beau,is,wet,<END>
i,suppose,the,yankees,even,stole,his,extra,diapers,<END>
he,scarlett,what,on,earth,is,in,his,diaper,<END>
she,thrust,a,suddenly,frightened,hand,down,the,baby's,back,and,brought,up,the,wallet,<END>
for,a,moment,she,looked,at,it,as,if,she,had,never,seen,it,before,and,then,she,began,to,laugh,peal,on,peal,of,mirth,that,had,in,it,no,hint,of,hysteria,<END>
nobody,but,you,would,ever,have,thought,of,it,she,cried,and,flinging,her,arms,around,scarlett's,neck,she,kissed,her,<END>
you,are,the,beatenest,sister,i,ever,had,<END>
scarlett,permitted,the,embrace,because,she,was,too,tired,to,struggle,because,the,words,of,praise,brought,balm,to,her,spirit,and,because,in,the,dark,smoke-filled,kitchen,there,had,been,born,a,greater,respect,for,her,sister-in-law,a,closer,feeling,of,comradeship,<END>
i'll,say,this,for,her,she,thought,grudgingly,she's,always,there,when,you,need,her,<END>
chapter,xxviii,<END>
cold,weather,set,in,abruptly,with,a,killing,frost,<END>
chilling,winds,swept,beneath,the,doorsills,and,rattled,the,loose,windowpanes,with,a,monotonous,tinkling,sound,<END>
the,last,of,the,leaves,fell,from,the,bare,trees,and,only,the,pines,stood,clothed,black,and,cold,against,pale,skies,<END>
the,rutted,red,roads,were,frozen,to,flintiness,and,hunger,rode,the,winds,through,georgia,<END>
scarlett,recalled,bitterly,her,conversation,with,grandma,fontaine,<END>
on,that,afternoon,two,months,ago,which,now,seemed,years,in,the,past,she,had,told,the,old,lady,she,had,already,known,the,worst,which,could,possibly,happen,to,her,and,she,had,spoken,from,the,bottom,of,her,heart,<END>
now,that,remark,sounded,like,schoolgirl,hyperbole,<END>
before,sherman's,men,came,through,tara,the,second,time,she,had,her,small,riches,of,food,and,money,she,had,neighbors,more,fortunate,than,she,and,she,had,the,cotton,which,would,tide,her,over,until,spring,<END>
now,the,cotton,was,gone,the,food,was,gone,the,money,was,of,no,use,to,her,for,there,was,no,food,to,buy,with,it,and,the,neighbors,were,in,worse,plight,than,she,<END>
at,least,she,had,the,cow,and,the,calf,a,few,shoats,and,the,horse,and,the,neighbors,had,nothing,but,the,little,they,had,been,able,to,hide,in,the,woods,and,bury,in,the,ground,<END>
fairhill,the,tarleton,home,was,burned,to,the,foundations,and,mrs,tarleton,and,the,four,girls,were,existing,in,the,overseer's,house,<END>
the,munroe,house,near,lovejoy,was,leveled,too,<END>
the,wooden,wing,of,mimosa,had,burned,and,only,the,thick,resistant,stucco,of,the,main,house,and,the,frenzied,work,of,the,fontaine,women,and,their,slaves,with,wet,blankets,and,quilts,had,saved,it,<END>
the,calverts',house,had,again,been,spared,due,to,the,intercession,of,hilton,the,yankee,overseer,but,there,was,not,a,head,of,livestock,not,a,fowl,not,an,ear,of,corn,left,on,the,place,<END>
at,tara,and,throughout,the,county,the,problem,was,food,<END>
most,of,the,families,had,nothing,at,all,but,the,remains,of,their,yam,crops,and,their,peanuts,and,such,game,as,they,could,catch,in,the,woods,<END>
what,they,had,each,shared,with,less,fortunate,friends,as,they,had,done,in,more,prosperous,days,<END>
but,the,time,soon,came,when,there,was,nothing,to,share,<END>
at,tara,they,ate,rabbit,and,possum,and,catfish,if,pork,was,lucky,<END>
on,other,days,a,small,amount,of,milk,hickory,nuts,roasted,acorns,and,yams,<END>
they,were,always,hungry,<END>
to,scarlett,it,seemed,that,at,every,turn,she,met,outstretched,hands,pleading,eyes,<END>
the,sight,of,them,drove,her,almost,to,madness,for,she,was,as,hungry,as,they,<END>
she,ordered,the,calf,killed,because,he,drank,so,much,of,the,precious,milk,and,that,night,everyone,ate,so,much,fresh,veal,all,of,them,were,ill,she,knew,that,she,should,kill,one,of,the,shoats,but,she,put,it,off,from,day,to,day,hoping,to,raise,them,to,maturity,<END>
they,were,so,small,<END>
there,would,be,so,little,of,them,to,eat,if,they,were,killed,now,and,so,much,more,if,they,could,be,saved,a,little,longer,<END>
nightly,she,debated,with,melanie,the,advisability,of,sending,pork,abroad,on,the,horse,with,some,greenbacks,to,try,to,buy,food,<END>
but,the,fear,that,the,horse,might,be,captured,and,the,money,taken,from,pork,deterred,them,<END>
they,did,not,know,where,the,yankees,were,<END>
they,might,be,a,thousand,miles,away,or,only,across,the,river,<END>
once,scarlett,in,desperation,started,to,ride,out,herself,to,search,for,food,but,the,hysterical,outbursts,of,the,whole,family,fearful,of,the,yankees,made,her,abandon,the,plan,<END>
pork,foraged,far,at,times,not,coming,home,all,night,and,scarlett,did,not,ask,him,where,he,went,<END>
sometimes,he,returned,with,game,sometimes,with,a,few,ears,of,corn,a,bag,of,dried,peas,<END>
once,he,brought,home,a,rooster,which,he,said,he,found,in,the,woods,<END>
the,family,ate,it,with,relish,but,a,sense,of,guilt,knowing,very,well,pork,had,stolen,it,as,he,had,stolen,the,peas,and,corn,<END>
one,night,soon,after,this,he,tapped,on,scarlett's,door,long,after,the,house,was,asleep,and,sheepishly,exhibited,a,leg,peppered,with,small,shot,<END>
as,she,bandaged,it,for,him,he,explained,awkwardly,that,when,attempting,to,get,into,a,hen,coop,at,fayetteville,he,had,been,discovered,<END>
scarlett,did,not,ask,whose,hen,coop,but,patted,pork's,shoulder,gently,tears,in,her,eyes,<END>
negroes,were,provoking,sometimes,and,stupid,and,lazy,but,there,was,loyalty,in,them,that,money,couldn't,buy,a,feeling,of,oneness,with,their,white,folks,which,made,them,risk,their,lives,to,keep,food,on,the,table,<END>
in,other,days,pork's,pilferings,would,have,been,a,serious,matter,probably,calling,for,a,whipping,<END>
in,other,days,she,would,have,been,forced,at,least,to,reprimand,him,severely,<END>
always,remember,dear,ellen,had,said,you,are,responsible,for,the,moral,as,well,as,the,physical,welfare,of,the,darkies,god,has,intrusted,to,your,care,<END>
you,must,realize,that,they,are,like,children,and,must,be,guarded,from,themselves,like,children,and,you,must,always,set,them,a,good,example,<END>
but,now,scarlett,pushed,that,admonition,into,the,back,of,her,mind,<END>
that,she,was,encouraging,theft,and,perhaps,theft,from,people,worse,off,than,she,was,no,longer,a,matter,for,conscience,<END>
in,fact,the,morals,of,the,affair,weighed,lightly,upon,her,<END>
instead,of,punishment,or,reproof,she,only,regretted,he,had,been,shot,<END>
you,must,be,more,careful,pork,<END>
we,don't,want,to,lose,you,<END>
what,would,we,do,without,you,<END>
you've,been,mighty,good,and,faithful,and,when,we,get,some,money,again,i'm,going,to,buy,you,a,big,gold,watch,and,engrave,on,it,something,out,of,the,bible,<END>
'well,done,good,and,faithful,servant,',<END>

w'en,you,speckin',ter,git,dat,money,<END>
i,don't,know,pork,but,i'm,going,to,get,it,some,time,somehow,<END>
she,bent,on,him,an,unseeing,glance,that,was,so,passionately,bitter,he,stirred,uneasily,some,day,when,this,war,is,over,i'm,going,to,have,lots,of,money,and,when,i,do,i'll,never,be,hungry,or,cold,again,<END>
none,of,us,will,ever,be,hungry,or,cold,<END>
we'll,all,wear,fine,clothes,and,have,fried,chicken,every,day,and,<END>
then,she,stopped,<END>
the,strictest,rule,at,tara,one,which,she,herself,had,made,and,which,she,rigidly,enforced,was,that,no,one,should,ever,talk,of,the,fine,meals,they,had,eaten,in,the,past,or,what,they,would,eat,now,if,they,had,the,opportunity,<END>
pork,slipped,from,the,room,as,she,remained,staring,moodily,into,the,distance,<END>
in,the,old,days,now,dead,and,gone,life,had,been,so,complex,so,full,of,intricate,and,complicated,problems,<END>
there,had,been,the,problem,of,trying,to,win,ashley's,love,and,trying,to,keep,a,dozen,other,beaux,dangling,and,unhappy,<END>
there,had,been,small,breaches,of,conduct,to,be,concealed,from,her,elders,jealous,girls,to,be,flouted,or,placated,styles,of,dresses,and,materials,to,be,chosen,different,coiffures,to,be,tried,and,oh,so,many,many,other,matters,to,be,decided,<END>
now,life,was,so,amazingly,simple,<END>
now,all,that,mattered,was,food,enough,to,keep,off,starvation,clothing,enough,to,prevent,freezing,and,a,roof,overhead,which,did,not,leak,too,much,<END>
it,was,during,these,days,that,scarlett,dreamed,and,dreamed,again,the,nightmare,which,was,to,haunt,her,for,years,<END>
it,was,always,the,same,dream,the,details,never,varied,but,the,terror,of,it,mounted,each,time,it,came,to,her,and,the,fear,of,experiencing,it,again,troubled,even,her,waking,hours,<END>
she,remembered,so,well,the,incidents,of,the,day,when,she,had,first,dreamed,it,<END>
cold,rain,had,fallen,for,days,and,the,house,was,chill,with,drafts,and,dampness,<END>
the,logs,in,the,fireplace,were,wet,and,smoky,and,gave,little,heat,<END>
there,had,been,nothing,to,eat,except,milk,since,breakfast,for,the,yams,were,exhausted,and,pork's,snares,and,fishlines,had,yielded,nothing,<END>
one,of,the,shoats,would,have,to,be,killed,the,next,day,if,they,were,to,eat,at,all,<END>
strained,and,hungry,faces,black,and,white,were,staring,at,her,mutely,asking,her,to,provide,food,<END>
she,would,have,to,risk,losing,the,horse,and,send,pork,out,to,buy,something,<END>
and,to,make,matters,worse,wade,was,ill,with,a,sore,throat,and,a,raging,fever,and,there,was,neither,doctor,nor,medicine,for,him,<END>
hungry,weary,with,watching,her,child,scarlett,left,him,to,melanie's,care,for,a,while,and,lay,down,on,her,bed,to,nap,<END>
her,feet,icy,she,twisted,and,turned,unable,to,sleep,weighed,down,with,fear,and,despair,<END>
again,and,again,she,thought,what,shall,i,do,<END>
where,shall,i,turn,<END>
isn't,there,anybody,in,the,world,who,can,help,me,<END>
where,had,all,the,security,of,the,world,gone,<END>
why,wasn't,there,someone,some,strong,wise,person,to,take,the,burdens,from,her,<END>
she,wasn't,made,to,carry,them,<END>
she,did,not,know,how,to,carry,them,<END>
and,then,she,fell,into,an,uneasy,doze,<END>
she,was,in,a,wild,strange,country,so,thick,with,swirling,mist,she,could,not,see,her,hand,before,her,face,<END>
the,earth,beneath,her,feet,was,uneasy,<END>
it,was,a,haunted,land,still,with,a,terrible,stillness,and,she,was,lost,in,it,lost,and,terrified,as,a,child,in,the,night,<END>
she,was,bitterly,cold,and,hungry,and,so,fearful,of,what,lurked,in,the,mists,about,her,that,she,tried,to,scream,and,could,not,<END>
there,were,things,in,the,fog,reaching,out,fingers,to,pluck,at,her,skirt,to,drag,her,down,into,the,uneasy,quaking,earth,on,which,she,stood,silent,relentless,spectral,hands,<END>
then,she,knew,that,somewhere,in,the,opaque,gloom,about,her,there,was,shelter,help,a,haven,of,refuge,and,warmth,<END>
but,where,was,it,<END>
could,she,reach,it,before,the,hands,clutched,her,and,dragged,her,down,into,the,quicksands,<END>
suddenly,she,was,running,running,through,the,mist,like,a,mad,thing,crying,and,screaming,throwing,out,her,arms,to,clutch,only,empty,air,and,wet,mist,<END>
where,was,the,haven,<END>
it,eluded,her,but,it,was,there,hidden,somewhere,<END>
if,she,could,only,reach,it,<END>
if,she,could,only,reach,it,she,would,be,safe,<END>
but,terror,was,weakening,her,legs,hunger,making,her,faint,<END>
she,gave,one,despairing,cry,and,awoke,to,find,melanie's,worried,face,above,her,and,melanie's,hand,shaking,her,to,wakefulness,<END>
the,dream,returned,again,and,again,whenever,she,went,to,sleep,with,an,empty,stomach,<END>
and,that,was,frequently,enough,<END>
it,so,frightened,her,that,she,feared,to,sleep,although,she,feverishly,told,herself,there,was,nothing,in,such,a,dream,to,be,afraid,of,<END>
there,was,nothing,in,a,dream,about,fog,to,scare,her,so,<END>
nothing,at,all,yet,the,thought,of,dropping,off,into,that,mist-filled,country,so,terrified,her,she,began,sleeping,with,melanie,who,would,wake,her,up,when,her,moaning,and,twitching,revealed,that,she,was,again,in,the,clutch,of,the,dream,<END>

like,their,animals,the,men,had,been,invalided,out,of,the,front-line,forces,and,except,for,frank,all,of,them,had,an,arm,missing,or,an,eye,gone,or,stiffened,joints,<END>
most,of,them,wore,blue,overcoats,of,captured,yankees,and,for,a,brief,instant,of,horror,those,at,tara,thought,sherman's,men,had,returned,<END>

for,all,their,dirty,beards,and,tatters,they,were,a,well-bred,crowd,full,of,pleasant,small,talk,jokes,and,compliments,and,very,glad,to,be,spending,christmas,eve,in,a,big,house,surrounded,by,pretty,women,as,they,had,been,accustomed,to,do,in,days,long,past,<END>
they,refused,to,be,serious,about,the,war,told,outrageous,lies,to,make,the,girls,laugh,and,brought,to,the,bare,and,looted,house,the,first,lightness,the,first,hint,of,festivity,it,had,known,in,many,a,day,<END>

scarlett,knew,the,effort,this,involved,both,mentally,and,physically,for,melanie,suffered,torments,of,shyness,in,the,presence,of,anything,male,<END>

it,now,hung,in,the,pantry,and,she,had,grimly,promised,her,household,that,she,would,scratch,out,the,eyes,of,anyone,who,mentioned,the,shoat,to,their,guests,or,the,presence,of,the,dead,pig's,sisters,and,brothers,safe,in,their,pen,in,the,swamp,<END>
these,hungry,men,could,devour,the,whole,shoat,at,one,meal,and,if,they,knew,of,the,live,hogs,they,could,commandeer,them,for,the,army,<END>

it,was,hard,enough,for,her,to,feed,her,own,<END>
the,men,added,as,dessert,some,ramrod,rolls,from,their,knapsacks,and,this,was,the,first,time,scarlett,had,ever,seen,this,confederate,article,of,diet,about,which,there,were,almost,as,many,jokes,as,about,lice,<END>
they,were,charred,spirals,of,what,appeared,to,be,wood,<END>

the,soldiers,mixed,their,ration,of,corn,meal,with,water,and,salt,too,when,they,could,get,it,wrapped,the,thick,paste,about,their,ramrods,and,roasted,the,mess,over,camp,fires,<END>
it,was,as,hard,as,rock,candy,and,as,tasteless,as,sawdust,and,after,one,bite,scarlett,hastily,handed,it,back,amid,roars,of,laughter,<END>
she,met,melanie's,eyes,and,the,same,thought,was,plain,in,both,faces,<END>
how,can,they,go,on,fighting,if,they,have,only,this,stuff,to,eat,<END>
the,meal,was,gay,enough,and,even,gerald,presiding,absently,at,the,head,of,the,table,managed,to,evoke,from,the,back,of,his,dim,mind,some,of,the,manner,of,a,host,and,an,uncertain,smile,<END>
the,men,talked,the,women,smiled,and,flattered,but,scarlett,turning,suddenly,to,frank,kennedy,to,ask,him,news,of,miss,pittypat,caught,an,expression,on,his,face,which,made,her,forget,what,she,intended,to,say,<END>
his,eyes,had,left,suellen's,and,were,wandering,about,the,room,to,gerald's,childlike,puzzled,eyes,to,the,floor,bare,of,rugs,to,the,mantelpiece,denuded,of,its,ornaments,the,sagging,springs,and,torn,upholstery,into,which,yankee,bayonets,had,ripped,the,cracked,mirror,above,the,sideboard,the,unfaded,squares,on,the,wall,where,pictures,had,hung,before,the,looters,came,the,scant,table,service,the,decently,mended,but,old,dresses,of,the,girls,the,flour,sack,which,had,been,made,into,a,kilt,for,wade,<END>

he,loved,suellen,liked,her,sisters,respected,gerald,and,had,a,genuine,fondness,for,the,plantation,<END>
since,sherman,had,swept,through,georgia,frank,had,seen,many,appalling,sights,as,he,rode,about,the,state,trying,to,collect,supplies,but,nothing,had,gone,to,his,heart,as,tara,did,now,<END>
he,wanted,to,do,something,for,the,o'haras,especially,suellen,and,there,was,nothing,he,could,do,<END>
he,was,unconsciously,wagging,his,whiskered,head,in,pity,and,clicking,his,tongue,against,his,teeth,when,scarlett,caught,his,eye,<END>
he,saw,the,flame,of,indignant,pride,in,them,and,he,dropped,his,gaze,quickly,to,his,plate,in,embarrassment,<END>
the,girls,were,hungry,for,news,<END>
there,had,been,no,mail,service,since,atlanta,fell,now,four,months,past,and,they,were,in,complete,ignorance,as,to,where,the,yankees,were,how,the,confederate,army,was,faring,what,had,happened,to,atlanta,and,to,old,friends,<END>
frank,whose,work,took,him,all,over,the,section,was,as,good,as,a,newspaper,better,even,for,he,was,kin,to,or,knew,almost,everyone,from,macon,north,to,atlanta,and,he,could,supply,bits,of,interesting,personal,gossip,which,the,papers,always,omitted,<END>
to,cover,his,embarrassment,at,being,caught,by,scarlett,he,plunged,hastily,into,a,recital,of,news,<END>
the,confederates,he,told,them,had,retaken,atlanta,after,sherman,marched,out,but,it,was,a,valueless,prize,as,sherman,had,burned,it,completely,<END>
but,i,thought,atlanta,burned,the,night,i,left,cried,scarlett,bewildered,<END>
i,thought,our,boys,burned,it,<END>
oh,no,miss,scarlett,<END>
cried,frank,shocked,<END>
we'd,never,burn,one,of,our,own,towns,with,our,own,folks,in,it,<END>
what,you,saw,burning,was,the,warehouses,and,the,supplies,we,didn't,want,the,yankees,to,capture,and,the,foundries,and,the,ammunition,<END>
but,that,was,all,<END>
when,sherman,took,the,town,the,houses,and,stores,were,standing,there,as,pretty,as,you,please,<END>
and,he,quartered,his,men,in,them,<END>
but,what,happened,to,the,people,<END>
did,he,did,he,kill,them,<END>
he,killed,some,but,not,with,bullets,said,the,one-eyed,soldier,grimly,<END>
soon's,he,marched,into,atlanta,he,told,the,mayor,that,all,the,people,in,town,would,have,to,move,out,every,living,soul,<END>
and,there,were,plenty,of,old,folks,that,couldn't,stand,the,trip,and,sick,folks,that,ought,not,to,have,been,moved,and,ladies,who,were,well,ladies,who,hadn't,ought,to,be,moved,either,<END>
and,he,moved,them,out,in,the,biggest,rainstorm,you,ever,saw,hundreds,and,hundreds,of,them,and,dumped,them,in,the,woods,near,rough,and,ready,and,sent,word,to,general,hood,to,come,and,get,them,<END>
and,a,plenty,of,the,folks,died,of,pneumonia,and,not,being,able,to,stand,that,sort,of,treatment,<END>
oh,but,why,did,he,do,that,<END>
they,couldn't,have,done,him,any,harm,cried,melanie,<END>
he,said,he,wanted,the,town,to,rest,his,men,and,horses,in,said,frank,<END>
and,he,rested,them,there,till,the,middle,of,november,and,then,he,lit,out,<END>
and,he,set,fire,to,the,whole,town,when,he,left,and,burned,everything,<END>
oh,surely,not,everything,<END>
cried,the,girls,in,dismay,<END>
it,was,inconceivable,that,the,bustling,town,they,knew,so,full,of,people,so,crowded,with,soldiers,was,gone,<END>
all,the,lovely,homes,beneath,shady,trees,all,the,big,stores,and,the,fine,hotels,surely,they,couldn't,be,gone,<END>

scarlett's,heart,sank,because,she,had,come,to,love,the,place,second,only,to,tara,<END>
well,almost,everything,frank,amended,hastily,disturbed,by,the,expressions,on,their,faces,<END>
he,tried,to,look,cheerful,for,he,did,not,believe,in,upsetting,ladies,<END>
upset,ladies,always,upset,him,and,made,him,feel,helpless,<END>
he,could,not,bring,himself,to,tell,them,the,worst,<END>
let,them,find,out,from,some,one,else,<END>
he,could,not,tell,them,what,the,army,saw,when,it,marched,back,into,atlanta,the,acres,and,acres,of,chimneys,standing,blackly,above,ashes,piles,of,half-burned,rubbish,and,tumbled,heaps,of,brick,clogging,the,streets,old,trees,dying,from,fire,their,charred,limbs,tumbling,to,the,ground,in,the,cold,wind,<END>
he,remembered,how,the,sight,had,turned,him,sick,remembered,the,bitter,curses,of,the,confederates,when,they,saw,the,remains,of,the,town,<END>
he,hoped,the,ladies,would,never,hear,of,the,horrors,of,the,looted,cemetery,for,they'd,never,get,over,that,<END>
charlie,hamilton,and,melanie's,mother,and,father,were,buried,there,<END>
the,sight,of,that,cemetery,still,gave,frank,nightmares,<END>
hoping,to,find,jewelry,buried,with,the,dead,the,yankee,soldiers,had,broken,open,vaults,dug,up,graves,<END>
they,had,robbed,the,bodies,stripped,from,the,coffins,gold,and,silver,name,plates,silver,trimmings,and,silver,handles,<END>
the,skeletons,and,corpses,flung,helterskelter,among,their,splintered,caskets,lay,exposed,and,so,pitiful,<END>
and,frank,couldn't,tell,them,about,the,dogs,and,the,cats,<END>
ladies,set,such,a,store,by,pets,<END>
but,the,thousands,of,starving,animals,left,homeless,when,their,masters,had,been,so,rudely,evacuated,had,shocked,him,almost,as,much,as,the,cemetery,for,frank,loved,cats,and,dogs,<END>
the,animals,had,been,frightened,cold,ravenous,wild,as,forest,creatures,the,strong,attacking,the,weak,the,weak,waiting,for,the,weaker,to,die,so,they,could,eat,them,<END>
and,above,the,ruined,town,the,buzzards,splotched,the,wintry,sky,with,graceful,sinister,bodies,<END>
frank,cast,about,in,his,mind,for,some,mitigating,information,that,would,make,the,ladies,feel,better,<END>
there's,some,houses,still,standing,he,said,houses,that,set,on,big,lots,away,from,other,houses,and,didn't,catch,fire,<END>
and,the,churches,and,the,masonic,hall,are,left,<END>
and,a,few,stores,too,<END>
but,the,business,section,and,all,along,the,railroad,tracks,and,at,five,points,well,ladies,that,part,of,town,is,flat,on,the,ground,<END>
then,cried,scarlett,bitterly,that,warehouse,charlie,left,me,down,on,the,tracks,it's,gone,too,<END>
if,it,was,near,the,tracks,it's,gone,but,suddenly,he,smiled,<END>
why,hadn't,he,thought,of,it,before,<END>
cheer,up,ladies,<END>
your,aunt,pitty's,house,is,still,standing,<END>
it's,kind,of,damaged,but,there,it,is,<END>
oh,how,did,it,escape,<END>
well,it's,made,of,brick,and,it's,got,about,the,only,slate,roof,in,atlanta,and,that,kept,the,sparks,from,setting,it,afire,i,guess,<END>
and,then,it's,about,the,last,house,on,the,north,end,of,town,and,the,fire,wasn't,so,bad,over,that,way,<END>
of,course,the,yankees,quartered,there,tore,it,up,aplenty,<END>
they,even,burned,the,baseboard,and,the,mahogany,stair,rail,for,firewood,but,shucks,<END>
it's,in,good,shape,<END>
when,i,saw,miss,pitty,last,week,in,macon,<END>
you,saw,her,<END>
how,is,she,<END>
just,fine,<END>
just,fine,<END>
when,i,told,her,her,house,was,still,standing,she,made,up,her,mind,to,come,home,right,away,<END>
that,is,if,that,old,darky,peter,will,let,her,come,<END>
lots,of,the,atlanta,people,have,already,come,back,because,they,got,nervous,about,macon,<END>
sherman,didn't,take,macon,but,everybody,is,afraid,wilson's,raiders,will,get,there,soon,and,he's,worse,than,sherman,<END>
but,how,silly,of,them,to,come,back,if,there,aren't,any,houses,<END>
where,do,they,live,<END>
miss,scarlett,they're,living,in,tents,and,shacks,and,log,cabins,and,doubling,up,six,and,seven,families,in,the,few,houses,still,standing,<END>
and,they're,trying,to,rebuild,<END>
now,miss,scarlett,don't,say,they,are,silly,<END>
you,know,atlanta,folks,as,well,as,i,do,<END>
they,are,plumb,set,on,that,town,most,as,bad,as,charlestonians,are,about,charleston,and,it'll,take,more,than,yankees,and,a,burning,to,keep,them,away,<END>
atlanta,folks,are,begging,your,pardon,miss,melly,as,stubborn,as,mules,about,atlanta,<END>
i,don't,know,why,for,i,always,thought,that,town,a,mighty,pushy,impudent,sort,of,place,<END>
but,then,i'm,a,countryman,born,and,i,don't,like,any,town,<END>
and,let,me,tell,you,the,ones,who,are,getting,back,first,are,the,smart,ones,<END>
the,ones,who,come,back,last,won't,find,a,stick,or,stone,or,brick,of,their,houses,because,everybody's,out,salvaging,things,all,over,town,to,rebuild,their,houses,<END>
just,day,before,yesterday,i,saw,mrs,merriwether,and,miss,maybelle,and,their,old,darky,woman,out,collecting,brick,in,a,wheelbarrow,<END>

'course,she,was,only,joking,but,that,shows,you,how,they,feel,about,it,<END>
i,think,they've,got,a,lot,of,spirit,said,melanie,proudly,<END>
don't,you,scarlett,<END>
scarlett,nodded,a,grim,pleasure,and,pride,in,her,adopted,town,filling,her,<END>
as,frank,said,it,was,a,pushy,impudent,place,and,that,was,why,she,liked,it,<END>
it,wasn't,hide-bound,and,stick-in-the-,muddish,like,the,older,towns,and,it,had,a,brash,exuberance,that,matched,her,own,<END>
i'm,like,atlanta,she,thought,<END>
it,takes,more,than,yankees,or,a,burning,to,keep,me,down,<END>
if,aunt,pitty,is,going,back,to,atlanta,we'd,better,go,back,and,stay,with,her,scarlett,said,melanie,interrupting,her,train,of,thought,<END>
she'll,die,of,fright,alone,<END>
now,how,can,i,leave,here,melly,<END>
scarlett,asked,crossly,<END>
if,you,are,so,anxious,to,go,go,<END>

how,thoughtless,of,me,<END>
of,course,you,can't,leave,tara,and,and,i,guess,uncle,peter,and,cookie,can,take,care,of,auntie,<END>
there's,nothing,to,keep,you,from,going,scarlett,pointed,out,shortly,<END>
you,know,i,wouldn't,leave,you,answered,melanie,<END>
and,i,i,would,be,just,frightened,to,death,without,you,<END>
suit,yourself,<END>
besides,you,wouldn't,catch,me,going,back,to,atlanta,<END>
just,as,soon,as,they,get,a,few,houses,up,sherman,will,come,back,and,burn,it,again,<END>
he,won't,be,back,said,frank,and,despite,his,efforts,his,face,drooped,<END>
he's,gone,on,through,the,state,to,the,coast,<END>
savannah,was,captured,this,week,and,they,say,the,yankees,are,going,on,up,into,south,carolina,<END>
savannah,taken,<END>

they,didn't,have,enough,men,to,hold,it,though,they,used,every,man,they,could,get,every,man,who,could,drag,one,foot,after,another,<END>
do,you,know,that,when,the,yankees,were,marching,on,milledgeville,they,called,out,all,the,cadets,from,the,military,academies,no,matter,how,young,they,were,and,even,opened,the,state,penitentiary,to,get,fresh,troops,<END>
yes,sir,they,turned,loose,every,convict,who,was,willing,to,fight,and,promised,him,a,pardon,if,he,lived,through,the,war,<END>

surely,he,could,have,held,savannah,<END>
why,miss,melanie,frank,was,startled,and,reproachful,general,hood,hasn't,been,down,in,that,section,at,all,<END>
he's,been,fighting,up,in,tennessee,trying,to,draw,the,yankees,out,of,georgia,<END>

you,know,they,don't,mr,kennedy,<END>

oh,if,we,could,just,wipe,every,yankee,off,the,face,of,the,earth,<END>
oh,i,know,that,ashley,is,<END>

cried,scarlett,her,heart,in,her,throat,<END>
as,long,as,no,one,said,ashley,was,dead,there,persisted,in,her,heart,a,faint,hope,that,he,lived,but,she,felt,that,if,she,heard,the,words,pronounced,in,that,moment,he,would,die,<END>
now,mrs,wilkes,don't,you,bother,about,your,husband,said,the,one-eyed,man,soothingly,<END>
i,was,captured,after,first,manassas,and,exchanged,later,and,when,i,was,in,prison,they,fed,me,off,the,fat,of,the,land,fried,chicken,and,hot,biscuits,<END>
i,think,you,are,a,liar,said,melanie,with,a,faint,smile,and,the,first,sign,of,spirit,scarlett,had,ever,seen,her,display,with,a,man,<END>
what,do,you,think,<END>
i,think,so,too,said,the,one-eyed,man,and,slapped,his,leg,with,a,laugh,<END>
if,you'll,all,come,into,the,parlor,i'll,sing,you,some,christmas,carols,said,melanie,glad,to,change,the,subject,<END>
the,piano,was,one,thing,the,yankees,couldn't,carry,away,<END>
is,it,terribly,out,of,tune,suellen,<END>
dreadfully,answered,suellen,happily,beckoning,with,a,smile,to,frank,<END>
but,as,they,all,passed,from,the,room,frank,hung,back,tugging,at,scarlett's,sleeve,<END>
may,i,speak,to,you,alone,<END>
for,an,awful,moment,she,feared,he,was,going,to,ask,about,her,livestock,and,she,braced,herself,for,a,good,lie,<END>
when,the,room,was,cleared,and,they,stood,by,the,fire,all,the,false,cheerfulness,which,had,colored,frank's,face,in,front,of,the,others,passed,and,she,saw,that,he,looked,like,an,old,man,<END>
his,face,was,as,dried,and,brown,as,the,leaves,that,were,blowing,about,the,lawn,of,tara,and,his,ginger-colored,whiskers,were,thin,and,scraggly,and,streaked,with,gray,<END>
he,clawed,at,them,absently,and,cleared,his,throat,in,an,annoying,way,before,he,spoke,<END>
i'm,sorry,about,your,ma,miss,scarlett,<END>
please,don't,talk,about,it,<END>
and,your,pa,has,he,been,this,way,since,<END>
yes,he's,he's,not,himself,as,you,can,see,<END>
he,sure,set,a,store,by,her,<END>
oh,mr,kennedy,please,don't,let's,talk,<END>
i'm,sorry,miss,scarlett,and,he,shuffled,his,feet,nervously,<END>
the,truth,is,i,wanted,to,take,up,something,with,your,pa,and,now,i,see,it,won't,do,any,good,<END>
perhaps,i,can,help,you,mr,kennedy,<END>
you,see,i'm,the,head,of,the,house,now,<END>
well,i,began,frank,and,again,clawed,nervously,at,his,beard,<END>
the,truth,is,well,miss,scarlett,i,was,aiming,to,ask,him,for,miss,suellen,<END>
do,you,mean,to,tell,me,cried,scarlett,in,amused,amazement,that,you,haven't,yet,asked,pa,for,suellen,<END>
and,you've,been,courting,her,for,years,<END>
he,flushed,and,grinned,embarrassedly,and,in,general,looked,like,a,shy,and,sheepish,boy,<END>
well,i,i,didn't,know,if,she'd,have,me,<END>
i'm,so,much,older,than,she,is,and,there,were,so,many,good-looking,young,bucks,hanging,around,tara,<END>
hump,<END>
thought,scarlett,they,were,hanging,around,me,not,her,<END>
and,i,don't,know,yet,if,she'll,have,me,<END>
i've,never,asked,her,but,she,must,know,how,i,feel,<END>
i,i,thought,i'd,ask,mr,o'hara's,permission,and,tell,him,the,truth,<END>
miss,scarlett,i,haven't,got,a,cent,now,<END>
i,used,to,have,a,lot,of,money,if,you'll,forgive,me,mentioning,it,but,right,now,all,i,own,is,my,horse,and,the,clothes,i've,got,on,<END>
you,see,when,i,enlisted,i,sold,most,of,my,land,and,i,put,all,my,money,in,confederate,bonds,and,you,know,what,they're,worth,now,<END>
less,than,the,paper,they're,printed,on,<END>
and,anyway,i,haven't,got,them,now,because,they,burned,up,when,the,yankees,burned,my,sister's,house,<END>
i,know,i've,got,gall,asking,for,miss,suellen,now,when,i,haven't,a,cent,but,well,it's,this,way,<END>
i,got,to,thinking,that,we,don't,know,how,things,are,going,to,turn,out,about,this,war,<END>
it,sure,looks,like,the,end,of,the,world,for,me,<END>
there's,nothing,we,can,be,sure,of,and,and,i,thought,it,would,be,a,heap,of,comfort,to,me,and,maybe,to,her,if,we,were,engaged,<END>
that,would,be,something,sure,<END>
i,wouldn't,ask,to,marry,her,till,i,could,take,care,of,her,miss,scarlett,and,i,don't,know,when,that,will,be,<END>
but,if,true,love,carries,any,weight,with,you,you,can,be,certain,miss,suellen,will,be,rich,in,that,if,nothing,else,<END>
he,spoke,the,last,words,with,a,simple,dignity,that,touched,scarlett,even,in,her,amusement,<END>
it,was,beyond,her,comprehension,that,anyone,could,love,suellen,<END>
her,sister,seemed,to,her,a,monster,of,selfishness,of,complaints,and,of,what,she,could,only,describe,as,pure,cussedness,<END>
why,mr,kennedy,she,said,kindly,it's,quite,all,right,<END>
i'm,sure,i,can,speak,for,pa,he,always,set,a,store,by,you,and,he,always,expected,suellen,to,marry,you,<END>
did,he,now,<END>
cried,frank,happiness,in,his,face,<END>
indeed,yes,answered,scarlett,concealing,a,grin,as,she,remembered,how,frequently,gerald,had,rudely,bellowed,across,the,supper,table,to,suellen,how,now,missy,<END>
hasn't,your,ardent,beau,popped,the,question,yet,<END>
shall,i,be,asking,him,his,intentions,<END>
i,shall,ask,her,tonight,he,said,his,face,quivering,and,he,clutched,her,hand,and,shook,it,<END>
you're,so,kind,miss,scarlett,<END>
i'll,send,her,to,you,smiled,scarlett,starting,for,the,parlor,<END>
melanie,was,beginning,to,play,<END>
the,piano,was,sadly,out,of,tune,but,some,of,the,chords,were,musical,and,melanie,was,raising,her,voice,to,lead,the,others,in,hark,the,herald,angels,sing,<END>
scarlett,paused,<END>
it,did,not,seem,possible,that,war,had,swept,over,them,twice,that,they,were,living,in,a,ravaged,country,close,to,the,border,of,starvation,when,this,old,sweet,christmas,hymn,was,being,sung,<END>
abruptly,she,turned,to,frank,<END>
what,did,you,mean,when,you,said,it,looked,like,the,end,of,the,world,to,you,<END>
i'll,talk,frankly,he,said,slowly,but,i,wouldn't,want,you,to,be,alarming,the,other,ladies,with,what,i,say,<END>
the,war,can't,go,on,much,longer,<END>
there,aren't,any,fresh,men,to,fill,the,ranks,and,the,desertions,are,running,high,higher,than,the,army,likes,to,admit,<END>
you,see,the,men,can't,stand,to,be,away,from,their,families,when,they,know,they're,starving,so,they,go,home,to,try,to,provide,for,them,<END>
i,can't,blame,them,but,it,weakens,the,army,<END>
and,the,army,can't,fight,without,food,and,there,isn't,any,food,<END>
i,know,because,you,see,getting,food,is,my,business,<END>
i've,been,all,up,and,down,this,section,since,we,retook,atlanta,and,there,isn't,enough,to,feed,a,jaybird,<END>
it's,the,same,way,for,three,hundred,miles,south,to,savannah,<END>
the,folks,are,starving,and,the,railroads,are,torn,up,and,there,aren't,any,new,rifles,and,the,ammunition,is,giving,out,and,there's,no,leather,at,all,for,shoes,<END>
so,you,see,the,end,is,almost,here,<END>
but,the,fading,hopes,of,the,confederacy,weighed,less,heavily,on,scarlett,than,his,remark,about,the,scarcity,of,food,<END>
it,had,been,her,intention,to,send,pork,out,with,the,horse,and,wagon,the,gold,pieces,and,the,united,states,money,to,scour,the,countryside,for,provisions,and,material,for,clothes,<END>
but,if,what,frank,said,was,true,<END>
but,macon,hadn't,fallen,<END>
there,must,be,food,in,macon,<END>
just,as,soon,as,the,commissary,department,was,safely,on,its,way,she'd,start,pork,for,macon,and,take,the,chance,of,having,the,precious,horse,picked,up,by,the,army,<END>
she'd,have,to,risk,it,<END>
well,let's,don't,talk,about,unpleasant,things,tonight,mr,kennedy,she,said,<END>
you,go,and,sit,in,mother's,little,office,and,i'll,send,suellen,to,you,so,you,can,well,so,you'll,have,a,little,privacy,<END>
blushing,smiling,frank,slipped,out,of,the,room,and,scarlett,watched,him,go,<END>
what,a,pity,he,can't,marry,her,now,she,thought,<END>
that,would,be,one,less,mouth,to,feed,<END>

so,she,stayed,at,home,and,nagged,and,cried,and,said,once,too,often,oh,if,only,mother,was,here,<END>
at,that,scarlett,gave,her,the,long-,promised,slap,hitting,her,so,hard,it,knocked,her,screaming,to,the,bed,and,caused,great,consternation,throughout,the,house,<END>
thereafter,suellen,whined,the,less,at,least,in,scarlett's,presence,<END>
scarlett,spoke,truthfully,when,she,said,she,wanted,the,horse,to,rest,but,that,was,only,half,of,the,truth,<END>
the,other,half,was,that,she,had,paid,one,round,of,calls,on,the,county,in,the,first,month,after,the,surrender,and,the,sight,of,old,friends,and,old,plantations,had,shaken,her,courage,more,than,she,liked,to,admit,<END>
the,fontaines,had,fared,best,of,any,thanks,to,sally's,hard,ride,but,it,was,flourishing,only,by,comparison,with,the,desperate,situation,of,the,other,neighbors,<END>
grandma,fontaine,had,never,completely,recovered,from,the,heart,attack,she,had,the,day,she,led,the,others,in,beating,out,the,flames,and,saving,the,house,<END>
old,dr,fontaine,was,convalescing,slowly,from,an,amputated,arm,<END>
alex,and,tony,were,turning,awkward,hands,to,plows,and,hoe,handles,<END>
they,leaned,over,the,fence,rail,to,shake,hands,with,scarlett,when,she,called,and,they,laughed,at,her,rickety,wagon,their,black,eyes,bitter,for,they,were,laughing,at,themselves,as,well,as,her,<END>
she,asked,to,buy,seed,corn,from,them,and,they,promised,it,and,fell,to,discussing,farm,problems,<END>
they,had,twelve,chickens,two,cows,five,hogs,and,the,mule,they,brought,home,from,the,war,<END>
one,of,the,hogs,had,just,died,and,they,were,worried,about,losing,the,others,<END>
at,hearing,such,serious,words,about,hogs,from,these,ex-dandies,who,had,never,given,life,a,more,serious,thought,than,which,cravat,was,most,fashionable,scarlett,laughed,and,this,time,her,laugh,was,bitter,too,<END>
they,had,all,made,her,welcome,at,mimosa,and,had,insisted,on,giving,not,selling,her,the,seed,corn,<END>
the,quick,fontaine,tempers,flared,when,she,put,a,greenback,on,the,table,and,they,flatly,refused,payment,<END>
scarlett,took,the,corn,and,privately,slipped,a,dollar,bill,into,sally's,hand,<END>
sally,looked,like,a,different,person,from,the,girl,who,had,greeted,her,eight,months,before,when,scarlett,first,came,home,to,tara,<END>
then,she,had,been,pale,and,sad,but,there,had,been,a,buoyancy,about,her,<END>
now,that,buoyancy,had,gone,as,if,the,surrender,had,taken,all,hope,from,her,<END>
scarlett,she,whispered,as,she,clutched,the,bill,what,was,the,good,of,it,all,<END>
why,did,we,ever,fight,<END>
oh,my,poor,joe,<END>
oh,my,poor,baby,<END>
i,don't,know,why,we,fought,and,i,don't,care,said,scarlett,<END>
and,i'm,not,interested,<END>
i,never,was,interested,<END>
war,is,a,man's,business,not,a,woman's,<END>
all,i'm,interested,in,now,is,a,good,cotton,crop,<END>
now,take,this,dollar,and,buy,little,joe,a,dress,<END>
god,knows,he,needs,it,<END>
i'm,not,going,to,rob,you,of,your,corn,for,all,alex,and,tony's,politeness,<END>
the,boys,followed,her,to,the,wagon,and,assisted,her,in,courtly,for,all,their,rags,gay,with,the,volatile,fontaine,gaiety,but,with,the,picture,of,their,destitution,in,her,eyes,she,shivered,as,she,drove,away,from,mimosa,<END>
she,was,so,tired,of,poverty,and,pinching,<END>
what,a,pleasure,it,would,be,to,know,people,who,were,rich,and,not,worried,as,to,where,the,next,meal,was,coming,from,<END>
cade,calvert,was,at,home,at,pine,bloom,and,as,scarlett,came,up,the,steps,of,the,old,house,in,which,she,had,danced,so,often,in,happier,days,she,saw,that,death,was,in,his,face,<END>
he,was,emaciated,and,he,coughed,as,he,lay,in,an,easy,chair,in,the,sunshine,with,a,shawl,across,his,knees,but,his,face,lit,up,when,he,saw,her,<END>
just,a,little,cold,which,had,settled,in,his,chest,he,said,trying,to,rise,to,greet,her,<END>
got,it,from,sleeping,so,much,in,the,rain,<END>
but,it,would,be,gone,soon,and,then,he'd,lend,a,hand,in,the,work,<END>
cathleen,calvert,who,came,out,of,the,house,at,the,sound,of,voices,met,scarlett's,eyes,above,her,brother's,head,and,in,them,scarlett,read,knowledge,and,bitter,despair,<END>
cade,might,not,know,but,cathleen,knew,<END>
pine,bloom,looked,straggly,and,overgrown,with,weeds,seedling,pines,were,beginning,to,show,in,the,fields,and,the,house,was,sagging,and,untidy,<END>
cathleen,was,thin,and,taut,<END>
the,two,of,them,with,their,yankee,stepmother,their,four,little,half-sisters,and,hilton,the,yankee,overseer,remained,in,the,silent,oddly,echoing,house,<END>
scarlett,had,never,liked,hilton,any,more,than,she,liked,their,own,overseer,jonas,wilkerson,and,she,liked,him,even,less,now,as,he,sauntered,forward,and,greeted,her,like,an,equal,<END>
formerly,he,had,the,same,combination,of,servility,and,impertinence,which,wilkerson,possessed,but,now,with,mr,calvert,and,raiford,dead,in,the,war,and,cade,sick,he,had,dropped,all,servility,<END>
the,second,mrs,calvert,had,never,known,how,to,compel,respect,from,negro,servants,and,it,was,not,to,be,expected,that,she,could,get,it,from,a,white,man,<END>
mr,hilton,has,been,so,kind,about,staying,with,us,through,these,difficult,times,said,mrs,calvert,nervously,casting,quick,glances,at,her,silent,stepdaughter,<END>
very,kind,<END>
i,suppose,you,heard,how,he,saved,our,house,twice,when,sherman,was,here,<END>
i'm,sure,i,don't,know,how,we,would,have,managed,without,him,with,no,money,and,cade,<END>
a,flush,went,over,cade's,white,face,and,cathleen's,long,lashes,veiled,her,eyes,as,her,mouth,hardened,<END>
scarlett,knew,their,souls,were,writhing,in,helpless,rage,at,being,under,obligations,to,their,yankee,overseer,<END>
mrs,calvert,seemed,ready,to,weep,<END>
she,had,somehow,made,a,blunder,<END>
she,was,always,blundering,<END>
she,just,couldn't,understand,southerners,for,all,that,she,had,lived,in,georgia,twenty,years,<END>
she,never,knew,what,not,to,say,to,her,stepchildren,and,no,matter,what,she,said,or,did,they,were,always,so,exquisitely,polite,to,her,<END>
silently,she,vowed,she,would,go,north,to,her,own,people,taking,her,children,with,her,and,leave,these,puzzling,stiff-necked,strangers,<END>
after,these,visits,scarlett,had,no,desire,to,see,the,tarletons,<END>
now,that,the,four,boys,were,gone,the,house,burned,and,the,family,cramped,in,the,overseer's,cottage,she,could,not,bring,herself,to,go,<END>
but,suellen,and,carreen,begged,and,melanie,said,it,would,be,unneighborly,not,to,call,and,welcome,mr,tarleton,back,from,the,war,so,one,sunday,they,went,<END>
this,was,the,worst,of,all,<END>
as,they,drove,up,by,the,ruins,of,the,house,they,saw,beatrice,tarleton,dressed,in,a,worn,riding,habit,a,crop,under,her,arm,sitting,on,the,top,rail,of,the,fence,about,the,paddock,staring,moodily,at,nothing,<END>
beside,her,perched,the,bow-legged,little,negro,who,had,trained,her,horses,and,he,looked,as,glum,as,his,mistress,<END>
the,paddock,once,full,of,frolicking,colts,and,placid,brood,mares,was,empty,now,except,for,one,mule,the,mule,mr,tarleton,had,ridden,home,from,the,surrender,<END>
i,swear,i,don't,know,what,to,do,with,myself,now,that,my,darlings,are,gone,said,mrs,tarleton,climbing,down,from,the,fence,<END>
a,stranger,might,have,thought,she,spoke,of,her,four,dead,sons,but,the,girls,from,tara,knew,her,horses,were,in,her,mind,<END>
all,my,beautiful,horses,dead,<END>
and,oh,my,poor,nellie,<END>
if,i,just,had,nellie,<END>
and,nothing,but,a,damned,mule,on,the,place,<END>
a,damned,mule,she,repeated,looking,indignantly,at,the,scrawny,beast,<END>
it's,an,insult,to,the,memory,of,my,blooded,darlings,to,have,a,mule,in,their,paddock,<END>
mules,are,misbegotten,unnatural,critters,and,it,ought,to,be,illegal,to,breed,them,<END>
jim,tarleton,completely,disguised,by,a,bushy,beard,came,out,of,the,overseer's,house,to,welcome,and,kiss,the,girls,and,his,four,red-haired,daughters,in,mended,dresses,streamed,out,behind,him,tripping,over,the,dozen,black,and,tan,hounds,which,ran,barking,to,the,door,at,the,sound,of,strange,voices,<END>
there,was,an,air,of,studied,and,determined,cheerfulness,about,the,whole,family,which,brought,a,colder,chill,to,scarlett's,bones,than,the,bitterness,of,mimosa,or,the,deathly,brooding,of,pine,bloom,<END>
the,tarletons,insisted,that,the,girls,stay,for,dinner,saying,they,had,so,few,guests,these,days,and,wanted,to,hear,all,the,news,<END>
scarlett,did,not,want,to,linger,for,the,atmosphere,oppressed,her,but,melanie,and,her,two,sisters,were,anxious,for,a,longer,visit,so,the,four,stayed,for,dinner,and,ate,sparingly,of,the,side,meat,and,dried,peas,which,were,served,them,<END>
there,was,laughter,about,the,skimpy,fare,and,the,tarleton,girls,giggled,as,they,told,of,makeshifts,for,clothes,as,if,they,were,telling,the,most,amusing,of,jokes,<END>
melanie,met,them,halfway,surprising,scarlett,with,her,unexpected,vivacity,as,she,told,of,trials,at,tara,making,light,of,hardships,<END>
scarlett,could,hardly,speak,at,all,<END>
the,room,seemed,so,empty,without,the,four,great,tarleton,boys,lounging,and,smoking,and,teasing,<END>
and,if,it,seemed,empty,to,her,what,must,it,seem,to,the,tarletons,who,were,offering,a,smiling,front,to,their,neighbors,<END>
carreen,had,said,little,during,the,meal,but,when,it,was,over,she,slipped,over,to,mrs,tarleton's,side,and,whispered,something,<END>
mrs,tarleton's,face,changed,and,the,brittle,smile,left,her,lips,as,she,put,her,arm,around,carreen's,slender,waist,<END>
they,left,the,room,and,scarlett,who,felt,she,could,not,endure,the,house,another,minute,followed,them,<END>
they,went,down,the,path,through,the,garden,and,scarlett,saw,they,were,going,toward,the,burying,ground,<END>
well,she,couldn't,go,back,to,the,house,now,<END>
it,would,seem,too,rude,<END>
but,what,on,earth,did,carreen,mean,dragging,mrs,tarleton,out,to,the,boys',graves,when,beatrice,was,trying,so,hard,to,be,brave,<END>
there,were,two,new,marble,markers,in,the,brick-inclosed,lot,under,the,funereal,cedars,so,new,that,no,rain,had,splashed,them,with,red,dust,<END>
we,got,them,last,week,said,mrs,tarleton,proudly,<END>
mr,tarleton,went,to,macon,and,brought,them,home,in,the,wagon,<END>
tombstones,<END>
and,what,they,must,have,cost,<END>
suddenly,scarlett,did,not,feel,as,sorry,for,the,tarletons,as,she,had,at,first,<END>
anybody,who,would,waste,precious,money,on,tombstones,when,food,was,so,dear,so,almost,unattainable,didn't,deserve,sympathy,<END>
and,there,were,several,lines,carved,on,each,of,the,stones,<END>
the,more,carving,the,more,money,<END>
the,whole,family,must,be,crazy,<END>
and,it,had,cost,money,too,to,bring,the,three,boys',bodies,home,<END>
they,had,never,found,boyd,or,any,trace,of,him,<END>
between,the,graves,of,brent,and,stuart,was,a,stone,which,read,they,were,lovely,and,pleasant,in,their,lives,and,in,their,death,they,were,not,divided,<END>
on,the,other,stone,were,the,names,of,boyd,and,tom,with,something,in,latin,which,began,dulce,et,but,it,meant,nothing,to,scarlett,who,had,managed,to,evade,latin,at,the,fayetteville,academy,<END>
all,that,money,for,tombstones,<END>
why,they,were,fools,<END>
she,felt,as,indignant,as,if,her,own,money,had,been,squandered,<END>
carreen's,eyes,were,shining,oddly,<END>
i,think,it's,lovely,she,whispered,pointing,to,the,first,stone,<END>
carreen,would,think,it,lovely,<END>
anything,sentimental,stirred,her,<END>
yes,said,mrs,tarleton,and,her,voice,was,soft,we,thought,it,very,fitting,they,died,almost,at,the,same,time,<END>
stuart,first,and,then,brent,who,caught,up,the,flag,he,dropped,<END>
as,the,girls,drove,back,to,tara,scarlett,was,silent,for,a,while,thinking,of,what,she,had,seen,in,the,various,homes,remembering,against,her,will,the,county,in,its,glory,with,visitors,at,all,the,big,houses,and,money,plentiful,negroes,crowding,the,quarters,and,the,well-tended,fields,glorious,with,cotton,<END>
in,another,year,there'll,be,little,pines,all,over,these,fields,she,thought,and,looking,toward,the,encircling,forest,she,shuddered,<END>
without,the,darkies,it,will,be,all,we,can,do,to,keep,body,and,soul,together,<END>
nobody,can,run,a,big,plantation,without,the,darkies,and,lots,of,the,fields,won't,be,cultivated,at,all,and,the,woods,will,take,over,the,fields,again,<END>
nobody,can,plant,much,cotton,and,what,will,we,do,then,<END>
what'll,become,of,country,folks,<END>
town,folks,can,manage,somehow,<END>
they've,always,managed,<END>
but,we,country,folks,will,go,back,a,hundred,years,like,the,pioneers,who,had,little,cabins,and,just,scratched,a,few,acres,and,barely,existed,<END>
no,she,thought,grimly,tara,isn't,going,to,be,like,that,<END>
not,even,if,i,have,to,plow,myself,<END>
this,whole,section,this,whole,state,can,go,back,to,woods,if,it,wants,to,but,i,won't,let,tara,go,<END>
and,i,don't,intend,to,waste,my,money,on,tombstones,or,my,time,crying,about,the,war,<END>
we,can,make,out,somehow,<END>
i,know,we,could,make,out,somehow,if,the,men,weren't,all,dead,<END>
losing,the,darkies,isn't,the,worst,part,about,this,<END>
it's,the,loss,of,the,men,the,young,men,<END>
she,thought,again,of,the,four,tarletons,and,joe,fontaine,of,raiford,calvert,and,the,munroe,brothers,and,all,the,boys,from,fayetteville,and,jonesboro,whose,names,she,had,read,on,the,casualty,lists,<END>
if,there,were,just,enough,men,left,we,could,manage,somehow,but,<END>
another,thought,struck,her,suppose,she,wanted,to,marry,again,<END>
of,course,she,didn't,want,to,marry,again,<END>
once,was,certainly,enough,<END>
besides,the,only,man,she'd,ever,wanted,was,ashley,and,he,was,married,if,he,was,still,living,<END>
but,suppose,she,would,want,to,marry,<END>
who,would,there,be,to,marry,her,<END>
the,thought,was,appalling,<END>
melly,she,said,what's,going,to,happen,to,southern,girls,<END>
what,do,you,mean,<END>
just,what,i,say,<END>
what's,going,to,happen,to,them,<END>
there's,no,one,to,marry,them,<END>
why,melly,with,all,the,boys,dead,there'll,be,thousands,of,girls,all,over,the,south,who'll,die,old,maids,<END>
and,never,have,any,children,added,melanie,to,whom,this,was,the,most,important,thing,<END>
evidently,the,thought,was,not,new,to,suellen,who,sat,in,the,back,of,the,wagon,for,she,suddenly,began,to,cry,<END>
she,had,not,heard,from,frank,kennedy,since,christmas,<END>
she,did,not,know,if,the,lack,of,mail,service,was,the,cause,or,if,he,had,merely,trifled,with,her,affections,and,then,forgotten,her,<END>
or,maybe,he,had,been,killed,in,the,last,days,of,the,war,<END>
the,latter,would,have,been,infinitely,preferable,to,his,forgetting,her,for,at,least,there,was,some,dignity,about,a,dead,love,such,as,carreen,and,india,wilkes,had,but,none,about,a,deserted,fiancee,<END>
oh,in,the,name,of,god,hush,<END>
said,scarlett,<END>
oh,you,can,talk,sobbed,suellen,because,you've,been,married,and,had,a,baby,and,everybody,knows,some,man,wanted,you,<END>
but,look,at,me,<END>
and,you've,got,to,be,mean,and,throw,it,up,to,me,that,i'm,an,old,maid,when,i,can't,help,myself,<END>
i,think,you're,hateful,<END>
oh,hush,<END>
you,know,how,i,hate,people,who,bawl,all,the,time,<END>
you,know,perfectly,well,old,ginger,whiskers,isn't,dead,and,that,he'll,come,back,and,marry,you,<END>
he,hasn't,any,better,sense,<END>
but,personally,i'd,rather,be,an,old,maid,than,marry,him,<END>
there,was,silence,from,the,back,of,the,wagon,for,a,while,and,carreen,comforted,her,sister,with,absent-minded,pats,for,her,mind,was,a,long,way,off,riding,paths,three,years,old,with,brent,tarleton,beside,her,<END>
there,was,a,glow,an,exaltation,in,her,eyes,<END>
ah,said,melanie,sadly,what,will,the,south,be,like,without,all,our,fine,boys,<END>
what,would,the,south,have,been,if,they,had,lived,<END>
we,could,use,their,courage,and,their,energy,and,their,brains,<END>
scarlett,all,of,us,with,little,boys,must,raise,them,to,take,the,places,of,the,men,who,are,gone,to,be,brave,men,like,them,<END>
there,will,never,again,be,men,like,them,said,carreen,softly,<END>
no,one,can,take,their,places,<END>
they,drove,home,the,rest,of,the,way,in,silence,<END>
one,day,not,long,after,this,cathleen,calvert,rode,up,to,tara,at,sunset,<END>
her,sidesaddle,was,strapped,on,as,sorry,a,mule,as,scarlett,had,ever,seen,a,flop-eared,lame,brute,and,cathleen,was,almost,as,sorry,looking,as,the,animal,she,rode,<END>
her,dress,was,of,faded,gingham,of,the,type,once,worn,only,by,house,servants,and,her,sunbonnet,was,secured,under,her,chin,by,a,piece,of,twine,<END>
she,rode,up,to,the,front,porch,but,did,not,dismount,and,scarlett,and,melanie,who,had,been,watching,the,sunset,went,down,the,steps,to,meet,her,<END>
cathleen,was,as,white,as,cade,had,been,the,day,scarlett,called,white,and,hard,and,brittle,as,if,her,face,would,shatter,if,she,spoke,<END>
but,her,back,was,erect,and,her,head,was,high,as,she,nodded,to,them,<END>
scarlett,suddenly,remembered,the,day,of,the,wilkes,barbecue,when,she,and,cathleen,had,whispered,together,about,rhett,butler,<END>
how,pretty,and,fresh,cathleen,had,been,that,day,in,a,swirl,of,blue,organdie,with,fragrant,roses,at,her,sash,and,little,black,velvet,slippers,laced,about,her,small,ankles,<END>
and,now,there,was,not,a,trace,of,that,girl,in,the,stiff,figure,sitting,on,the,mule,<END>
i,won't,get,down,thank,you,she,said,<END>
i,just,came,to,tell,you,that,i'm,going,to,be,married,<END>
what,<END>
who,to,<END>
cathy,how,grand,<END>
when,<END>
tomorrow,said,cathleen,quietly,and,there,was,something,in,her,voice,which,took,the,eager,smiles,from,their,faces,<END>
i,came,to,tell,you,that,i'm,going,to,be,married,tomorrow,in,jonesboro,and,i'm,not,inviting,you,all,to,come,<END>
they,digested,this,in,silence,looking,up,at,her,puzzled,<END>
then,melanie,spoke,<END>
is,it,someone,we,know,dear,<END>
yes,said,cathleen,shortly,<END>
it's,mr,<END>
hilton,<END>
mr,<END>
hilton,<END>
yes,mr,hilton,our,overseer,<END>
scarlett,could,not,even,find,voice,to,say,oh,<END>
but,cathleen,peering,down,suddenly,at,melanie,said,in,a,low,savage,voice,if,you,cry,melly,i,can't,stand,it,<END>
i,shall,die,<END>
melanie,said,nothing,but,patted,the,foot,in,its,awkward,home-made,shoe,which,hung,from,the,stirrup,<END>
her,head,was,low,<END>
and,don't,pat,me,<END>
i,can't,stand,that,either,<END>
melanie,dropped,her,hand,but,still,did,not,look,up,<END>
well,i,must,go,<END>
i,only,came,to,tell,you,<END>
the,white,brittle,mask,was,back,again,and,she,picked,up,the,reins,<END>
how,is,cade,<END>
asked,scarlett,utterly,at,a,loss,but,fumbling,for,some,words,to,break,the,awkward,silence,<END>
he,is,dying,said,cathleen,shortly,<END>
there,seemed,to,be,no,feeling,in,her,voice,<END>
and,he,is,going,to,die,in,some,comfort,and,peace,if,i,can,manage,it,without,worry,about,who,will,take,care,of,me,when,he's,gone,<END>
you,see,my,stepmother,and,the,children,are,going,north,for,good,tomorrow,<END>
well,i,must,be,going,<END>

there,were,bright,tears,on,melanie's,lashes,and,understanding,in,her,eyes,and,before,them,cathleen's,lips,curved,into,the,crooked,smile,of,a,brave,child,who,tries,not,to,cry,<END>
it,was,all,very,bewildering,to,scarlett,who,was,still,trying,to,grasp,the,idea,that,cathleen,calvert,was,going,to,marry,an,overseer,cathleen,daughter,of,a,rich,planter,cathleen,who,next,to,scarlett,had,had,more,beaux,than,any,girl,in,the,county,<END>
cathleen,bent,down,and,melanie,tiptoed,<END>
they,kissed,<END>
then,cathleen,flapped,the,bridle,reins,sharply,and,the,old,mule,moved,off,<END>
melanie,looked,after,her,the,tears,streaming,down,her,face,<END>
scarlett,stared,still,dazed,<END>
melly,is,she,crazy,<END>
you,know,she,can't,be,in,love,with,him,<END>

oh,scarlett,don't,even,suggest,such,a,horrid,thing,<END>
oh,poor,cathleen,<END>
poor,cade,<END>
fiddle-dee-dee,<END>
cried,scarlett,beginning,to,be,irritated,<END>
it,was,annoying,that,melanie,always,seemed,to,grasp,more,of,situations,than,she,herself,did,<END>
cathleen's,plight,seemed,to,her,more,startling,than,catastrophic,<END>
of,course,it,was,no,pleasant,thought,marrying,yankee,white,trash,but,after,all,a,girl,couldn't,live,alone,on,a,plantation,she,had,to,have,a,husband,to,help,her,run,it,<END>
melly,it's,like,i,said,the,other,day,<END>
there,isn't,anybody,for,girls,to,marry,and,they've,got,to,marry,someone,<END>

it's,the,end,of,the,calverts,<END>
just,think,what,her,what,their,children,will,be,<END>
oh,scarlett,have,pork,saddle,the,horse,quickly,and,you,ride,after,her,and,tell,her,to,come,live,with,us,<END>

cried,scarlett,shocked,at,the,matter-of-fact,way,in,which,melanie,was,offering,tara,<END>
scarlett,certainly,had,no,intention,of,feeding,another,mouth,<END>
she,started,to,say,this,but,something,in,melanie's,stricken,face,halted,the,words,<END>
she,wouldn't,come,melly,she,amended,<END>
you,know,she,wouldn't,<END>
she's,so,proud,and,she'd,think,it,was,charity,<END>
that's,true,that's,true,<END>
said,melanie,distractedly,watching,the,small,cloud,of,red,dust,disappear,down,the,road,<END>
you've,been,with,me,for,months,thought,scarlett,grimly,looking,at,her,sister-in-law,and,it's,never,occurred,to,you,that,it's,charity,you're,living,on,<END>
and,i,guess,it,never,will,<END>
you're,one,of,those,people,the,war,didn't,change,and,you,go,right,on,thinking,and,acting,just,like,nothing,had,happened,like,we,were,still,rich,as,croesus,and,had,more,food,than,we,know,what,to,do,with,and,guests,didn't,matter,<END>

in,that,warm,summer,after,peace,came,tara,suddenly,lost,its,isolation,<END>
and,for,months,thereafter,a,stream,of,scarecrows,bearded,ragged,footsore,and,always,hungry,toiled,up,the,red,hill,to,tara,and,came,to,rest,on,the,shady,front,steps,wanting,food,and,a,night's,lodging,<END>
they,were,confederate,soldiers,walking,home,<END>

most,of,them,were,walking,a,few,fortunate,ones,rode,bony,horses,and,mules,which,the,terms,of,the,surrender,had,permitted,them,to,keep,gaunt,animals,which,even,an,untrained,eye,could,tell,would,never,reach,far-away,florida,and,south,georgia,<END>
going,home,<END>
going,home,<END>
that,was,the,only,thought,in,the,soldiers',minds,<END>
some,were,sad,and,silent,others,gay,and,contemptuous,of,hardships,but,the,thought,that,it,was,all,over,and,they,were,going,home,was,the,one,thing,that,sustained,them,<END>

they,left,bitterness,to,their,women,and,their,old,people,<END>

some,of,them,lacked,an,arm,or,a,leg,or,an,eye,many,had,scars,which,would,ache,in,rainy,weather,if,they,lived,for,seventy,years,but,these,seemed,small,matters,now,<END>

it,was,enough,that,they,themselves,were,alive,and,they,did,not,care,to,think,of,the,thousands,in,unmarked,graves,who,would,never,come,home,<END>
the,family,tried,to,bolster,melanie's,courage,after,each,of,these,disappointments,<END>

one,afternoon,in,june,when,everyone,at,tara,was,assembled,on,the,back,porch,eagerly,watching,pork,cut,the,first,half-ripe,watermelon,of,the,season,they,heard,hooves,on,the,gravel,of,the,front,drive,<END>

on,his,wide,black,face,accustomed,dignity,strove,with,delight,at,seeing,old,friends,with,the,result,that,his,brow,was,furrowed,in,a,frown,but,his,mouth,was,hanging,open,like,a,happy,toothless,old,hound's,<END>

common,sense,told,them,that,unless,ashley,developed,wings,it,would,be,weeks,or,even,months,before,he,could,travel,from,illinois,to,georgia,but,hearts,nevertheless,beat,wildly,whenever,a,soldier,turned,into,the,avenue,at,tara,<END>
each,bearded,scarecrow,might,be,ashley,<END>
and,if,it,were,not,ashley,perhaps,the,soldier,would,have,news,of,him,or,a,letter,from,aunt,pitty,about,him,<END>
black,and,white,they,rushed,to,the,front,porch,every,time,they,heard,footsteps,<END>
the,sight,of,a,uniform,was,enough,to,bring,everyone,flying,from,the,woodpile,the,pasture,and,the,cotton,patch,<END>
for,a,month,after,the,letter,came,work,was,almost,at,a,standstill,<END>
no,one,wanted,to,be,out,of,the,house,when,he,arrived,<END>
scarlett,least,of,all,<END>
and,she,could,not,insist,on,the,others,attending,to,their,duties,when,she,so,neglected,hers,<END>
but,when,the,weeks,crawled,by,and,ashley,did,not,come,or,any,news,of,him,tara,settled,back,into,its,old,routine,<END>
longing,hearts,could,only,stand,so,much,of,longing,<END>
an,uneasy,fear,crept,into,scarlett's,mind,that,something,had,happened,to,him,along,the,way,<END>
rock,island,was,so,far,away,and,he,might,have,been,weak,or,sick,when,released,from,prison,<END>
and,he,had,no,money,and,was,tramping,through,a,country,where,confederates,were,hated,<END>
if,only,she,knew,where,he,was,she,would,send,money,to,him,send,every,penny,she,had,and,let,the,family,go,hungry,so,he,could,come,home,swiftly,on,the,train,<END>
beloved,i,am,coming,home,to,you,<END>
in,the,first,rush,of,joy,when,her,eyes,met,those,words,they,had,meant,only,that,ashley,was,coming,home,to,her,<END>
now,in,the,light,of,cooler,reason,it,was,melanie,to,whom,he,was,returning,melanie,who,went,about,the,house,these,days,singing,with,joy,<END>
occasionally,scarlett,wondered,bitterly,why,melanie,could,not,have,died,in,childbirth,in,atlanta,<END>
that,would,have,made,things,perfect,<END>
then,she,could,have,married,ashley,after,a,decent,interval,and,made,little,beau,a,good,stepmother,too,<END>
when,such,thoughts,came,she,did,not,pray,hastily,to,god,telling,him,she,did,not,mean,it,<END>
god,did,not,frighten,her,any,more,<END>
soldiers,came,singly,and,in,pairs,and,dozens,and,they,were,always,hungry,<END>
scarlett,thought,despairingly,that,a,plague,of,locusts,would,be,more,welcome,<END>
she,cursed,again,the,old,custom,of,hospitality,which,had,flowered,in,the,era,of,plenty,the,custom,which,would,not,permit,any,traveler,great,or,humble,to,go,on,his,journey,without,a,night's,lodging,food,for,himself,and,his,horse,and,the,utmost,courtesy,the,house,could,give,<END>
she,knew,that,era,had,passed,forever,but,the,rest,of,the,household,did,not,nor,did,the,soldiers,and,each,soldier,was,welcomed,as,if,he,were,a,long-,awaited,guest,<END>
as,the,never-ending,line,went,by,her,heart,hardened,<END>
they,were,eating,the,food,meant,for,the,mouths,of,tara,vegetables,over,whose,long,rows,she,had,wearied,her,back,food,she,had,driven,endless,miles,to,buy,<END>
food,was,so,hard,to,get,and,the,money,in,the,yankee's,wallet,would,not,last,forever,<END>
only,a,few,greenbacks,and,the,two,gold,pieces,were,left,now,<END>
why,should,she,feed,this,horde,of,hungry,men,<END>
the,war,was,over,<END>
they,would,never,again,stand,between,her,and,danger,<END>
so,she,gave,orders,to,pork,that,when,soldiers,were,in,the,house,the,table,should,be,set,sparely,<END>
this,order,prevailed,until,she,noticed,that,melanie,who,had,never,been,strong,since,beau,was,born,was,inducing,pork,to,put,only,dabs,of,food,on,her,plate,and,giving,her,share,to,the,soldiers,<END>
you'll,have,to,stop,it,melanie,she,scolded,<END>
you're,half,sick,yourself,and,if,you,don't,eat,more,you'll,be,sick,in,bed,and,we'll,have,to,nurse,you,<END>
let,these,men,go,hungry,<END>
they,can,stand,it,<END>
they've,stood,it,for,four,years,and,it,won't,hurt,them,to,stand,it,a,little,while,longer,<END>
melanie,turned,to,her,and,on,her,face,was,the,first,expression,of,naked,emotion,scarlett,had,ever,seen,in,those,serene,eyes,<END>
oh,scarlett,don't,scold,me,<END>
let,me,do,it,<END>
you,don't,know,how,it,helps,me,<END>
every,time,i,give,some,poor,man,my,share,i,think,that,maybe,somewhere,on,the,road,up,north,some,woman,is,giving,my,ashley,a,share,of,her,dinner,and,it's,helping,him,to,get,home,to,me,<END>
my,ashley,<END>
beloved,i,am,coming,home,to,you,<END>
scarlett,turned,away,wordless,<END>
after,that,melanie,noticed,there,was,more,food,on,the,table,when,guests,were,present,even,though,scarlett,might,grudge,them,every,mouthful,<END>
when,the,soldiers,were,too,ill,to,go,on,and,there,were,many,such,scarlett,put,them,to,bed,with,none,too,good,grace,<END>
each,sick,man,meant,another,mouth,to,feed,<END>
someone,had,to,nurse,him,and,that,meant,one,less,worker,at,the,business,of,fence,building,hoeing,weeding,and,plowing,<END>
one,boy,on,whose,face,a,blond,fuzz,had,just,begun,to,sprout,was,dumped,on,the,front,porch,by,a,mounted,soldier,bound,for,fayetteville,<END>
he,had,found,him,unconscious,by,the,roadside,and,had,brought,him,across,his,saddle,to,tara,the,nearest,house,<END>
the,girls,thought,he,must,be,one,of,the,little,cadets,who,had,been,called,out,of,military,school,when,sherman,approached,milledgeville,but,they,never,knew,for,he,died,without,regaining,consciousness,and,a,search,of,his,pockets,yielded,no,information,<END>
a,nice-looking,boy,obviously,a,gentleman,and,somewhere,to,the,south,some,woman,was,watching,the,roads,wondering,where,he,was,and,when,he,was,coming,home,just,as,she,and,melanie,with,a,wild,hope,in,their,hearts,watched,every,bearded,figure,that,came,up,their,walk,<END>
they,buried,the,cadet,in,the,family,burying,ground,next,to,the,three,little,o'hara,boys,and,melanie,cried,sharply,as,pork,filled,in,the,grave,wondering,in,her,heart,if,strangers,were,doing,this,same,thing,to,the,tall,body,of,ashley,<END>
will,benteen,was,another,soldier,like,the,nameless,boy,who,arrived,unconscious,across,the,saddle,of,a,comrade,<END>
will,was,acutely,ill,with,pneumonia,and,when,the,girls,put,him,to,bed,they,feared,he,would,soon,join,the,boy,in,the,burying,ground,<END>
he,had,the,sallow,malarial,face,of,the,south,georgia,cracker,pale,pinkish,hair,and,washed-out,blue,eyes,which,even,in,delirium,were,patient,and,mild,<END>
one,of,his,legs,was,gone,at,the,knee,and,to,the,stump,was,fitted,a,roughly,whittled,wooden,peg,<END>
he,was,obviously,a,cracker,just,as,the,boy,they,had,buried,so,short,a,while,ago,was,obviously,a,planter's,son,<END>
just,how,the,girls,knew,this,they,could,not,say,<END>
certainly,will,was,no,dirtier,no,more,hairy,no,more,lice,infested,than,many,fine,gentlemen,who,came,to,tara,<END>
certainly,the,language,he,used,in,his,delirium,was,no,less,grammatical,than,that,of,the,tarleton,twins,<END>
but,they,knew,instinctively,as,they,knew,thoroughbred,horses,from,scrubs,that,he,was,not,of,their,class,<END>
but,this,knowledge,did,not,keep,them,from,laboring,to,save,him,<END>
emaciated,from,a,year,in,a,yankee,prison,exhausted,by,his,long,tramp,on,his,ill-fitting,wooden,peg,he,had,little,strength,to,combat,pneumonia,and,for,days,he,lay,in,the,bed,moaning,trying,to,get,up,fighting,battles,over,again,<END>
never,once,did,he,call,for,mother,wife,sister,or,sweetheart,and,this,omission,worried,carreen,<END>
a,man,ought,to,have,some,folks,she,said,<END>
and,he,sounds,like,he,didn't,have,a,soul,in,the,world,<END>
for,all,his,lankiness,he,was,tough,and,good,nursing,pulled,him,through,<END>
the,day,came,when,his,pale,blue,eyes,perfectly,cognizant,of,his,surroundings,fell,upon,carreen,sitting,beside,him,telling,her,rosary,beads,the,morning,sun,shining,through,her,fair,hair,<END>
then,you,warn't,a,dream,after,all,he,said,in,his,flat,toneless,voice,<END>
i,hope,i,ain't,troubled,you,too,much,ma'm,<END>
his,convalescence,was,a,long,one,and,he,lay,quietly,looking,out,of,the,window,at,the,magnolias,and,causing,very,little,trouble,to,anyone,<END>
carreen,liked,him,because,of,his,placid,and,unembarrassed,silences,<END>
she,would,sit,beside,him,through,the,long,hot,afternoons,fanning,him,and,saying,nothing,<END>
carreen,had,very,little,to,say,these,days,as,she,moved,delicate,and,wraithlike,about,the,tasks,which,were,within,her,strength,<END>
she,prayed,a,good,deal,for,when,scarlett,came,into,her,room,without,knocking,she,always,found,her,on,her,knees,by,her,bed,<END>
the,sight,never,failed,to,annoy,her,for,scarlett,felt,that,the,time,for,prayer,had,passed,<END>
if,god,had,seen,fit,to,punish,them,so,then,god,could,very,well,do,without,prayers,<END>
religion,had,always,been,a,bargaining,process,with,scarlett,<END>
she,promised,god,good,behavior,in,exchange,for,favors,<END>
god,had,broken,the,bargain,time,and,again,to,her,way,of,thinking,and,she,felt,that,she,owed,him,nothing,at,all,now,<END>
and,whenever,she,found,carreen,on,her,knees,when,she,should,have,been,taking,an,afternoon,nap,or,doing,the,mending,she,felt,that,carreen,was,shirking,her,share,of,the,burdens,<END>
she,said,as,much,to,will,benteen,one,afternoon,when,he,was,able,to,sit,up,in,a,chair,and,was,startled,when,he,said,in,his,flat,voice,let,her,be,miss,scarlett,<END>
it,comforts,her,<END>
comforts,her,<END>
yes,she's,prayin',for,your,ma,and,him,<END>
who,is,'him',<END>
his,faded,blue,eyes,looked,at,her,from,under,sandy,lashes,without,surprise,<END>
nothing,seemed,to,surprise,or,excite,him,<END>
perhaps,he,had,seen,too,much,of,the,unexpected,ever,to,be,startled,again,<END>
that,scarlett,did,not,know,what,was,in,her,sister's,heart,did,not,seem,odd,to,him,<END>
he,took,it,as,naturally,as,he,did,the,fact,that,carreen,had,found,comfort,in,talking,to,him,a,stranger,<END>
her,beau,that,boy,brent,something-or-other,who,was,killed,at,gettysburg,<END>
her,beau,<END>
said,scarlett,shortly,<END>
her,beau,nothing,<END>
he,and,his,brother,were,my,beaux,<END>
yes,so,she,told,me,<END>
looks,like,most,of,the,county,was,your,beaux,<END>
but,all,the,same,he,was,her,beau,after,you,turned,him,down,because,when,he,come,home,on,his,last,furlough,they,got,engaged,<END>
she,said,he,was,the,only,boy,she'd,ever,cared,about,and,so,it,kind,of,comforts,her,to,pray,for,him,<END>
well,fiddle-dee-dee,<END>
said,scarlett,a,very,small,dart,of,jealousy,entering,her,<END>
she,looked,curiously,at,this,lanky,man,with,his,bony,stooped,shoulders,his,pinkish,hair,and,calm,unwavering,eyes,<END>
so,he,knew,things,about,her,own,family,which,she,had,not,troubled,to,discover,<END>
so,that,was,why,carreen,mooned,about,praying,all,the,time,<END>
well,she'd,get,over,it,<END>
lots,of,girls,got,over,dead,sweethearts,yes,dead,husbands,too,<END>
she'd,certainly,gotten,over,charles,<END>
and,she,knew,one,girl,in,atlanta,who,had,been,widowed,three,times,by,the,war,and,was,still,able,to,take,notice,of,men,<END>
she,said,as,much,to,will,but,he,shook,his,head,<END>
not,miss,carreen,he,said,with,finality,<END>
will,was,pleasant,to,talk,to,because,he,had,so,little,to,say,and,yet,was,so,understanding,a,listener,<END>
she,told,him,about,her,problems,of,weeding,and,hoeing,and,planting,of,fattening,the,hogs,and,breeding,the,cow,and,he,gave,good,advice,for,he,had,owned,a,small,farm,in,south,georgia,and,two,negroes,<END>
he,knew,his,slaves,were,free,now,and,the,farm,gone,to,weeds,and,seedling,pines,<END>
his,sister,his,only,relative,had,moved,to,texas,with,her,husband,years,ago,and,he,was,alone,in,the,world,<END>
yet,none,of,these,things,seemed,to,bother,him,any,more,than,the,leg,he,had,left,in,virginia,<END>
yes,will,was,a,comfort,to,scarlett,after,hard,days,when,the,negroes,muttered,and,suellen,nagged,and,cried,and,gerald,asked,too,frequently,where,ellen,was,<END>
she,could,tell,will,anything,<END>
she,even,told,him,of,killing,the,yankee,and,glowed,with,pride,when,he,commented,briefly,good,work,<END>
eventually,all,the,family,found,their,way,to,will's,room,to,air,their,troubles,even,mammy,who,had,at,first,been,distant,with,him,because,he,was,not,quality,and,had,owned,only,two,slaves,<END>
when,he,was,able,to,totter,about,the,house,he,turned,his,hands,to,weaving,baskets,of,split,oak,and,mending,the,furniture,ruined,by,the,yankees,<END>
he,was,clever,at,whittling,and,wade,was,constantly,by,his,side,for,he,whittled,out,toys,for,him,the,only,toys,the,little,boy,had,<END>
with,will,in,the,house,everyone,felt,safe,in,leaving,wade,and,the,two,babies,while,they,went,about,their,tasks,for,he,could,care,for,them,as,deftly,as,mammy,and,only,melly,surpassed,him,at,soothing,the,screaming,black,and,white,babies,<END>
you've,been,mighty,good,to,me,miss,scarlett,he,said,and,me,a,stranger,and,nothin',to,you,all,<END>
i've,caused,you,a,heap,of,trouble,and,worry,and,if,it's,all,the,same,to,you,i'm,goin',to,stay,here,and,help,you,all,with,the,work,till,i've,paid,you,back,some,for,your,trouble,<END>
i,can't,ever,pay,it,all,'cause,there,ain't,no,payment,a,man,can,give,for,his,life,<END>
so,he,stayed,and,gradually,unobtrusively,a,large,part,of,the,burden,of,tara,shifted,from,scarlett's,shoulders,to,the,bony,shoulders,of,will,benteen,<END>
it,was,september,and,time,to,pick,the,cotton,<END>
will,benteen,sat,on,the,front,steps,at,scarlett's,feet,in,the,pleasant,sunshine,of,the,early,autumn,afternoon,and,his,flat,voice,went,on,and,on,languidly,about,the,exorbitant,costs,of,ginning,the,cotton,at,the,new,gin,near,fayetteville,<END>
however,he,had,learned,that,day,in,fayetteville,that,he,could,cut,this,expense,a,fourth,by,lending,the,horse,and,wagon,for,two,weeks,to,the,gin,owner,<END>
he,had,delayed,closing,the,bargain,until,he,discussed,it,with,scarlett,<END>
she,looked,at,the,lank,figure,leaning,against,the,porch,column,chewing,a,straw,<END>
undoubtedly,as,mammy,frequently,declared,will,was,something,the,lord,had,provided,and,scarlett,often,wondered,how,tara,could,have,lived,through,the,last,few,months,without,him,<END>
he,never,had,much,to,say,never,displayed,any,energy,never,seemed,to,take,much,interest,in,anything,that,went,on,about,him,but,he,knew,everything,about,everybody,at,tara,<END>
and,he,did,things,<END>
he,did,them,silently,patiently,and,competently,<END>
though,he,had,only,one,leg,he,could,work,faster,than,pork,<END>
and,he,could,get,work,out,of,pork,which,was,to,scarlett,a,marvelous,thing,<END>
when,the,cow,had,the,colic,and,the,horse,fell,ill,with,a,mysterious,ailment,which,threatened,to,remove,him,permanently,from,them,will,sat,up,nights,with,them,and,saved,them,<END>
that,he,was,a,shrewd,trader,brought,him,scarlett's,respect,for,he,could,ride,out,in,the,mornings,with,a,bushel,or,two,of,apples,sweet,potatoes,and,other,vegetables,and,return,with,seeds,lengths,of,cloth,flour,and,other,necessities,which,she,knew,she,could,never,have,acquired,good,trader,though,she,was,<END>
he,had,gradually,slipped,into,the,status,of,a,member,of,the,family,and,slept,on,a,cot,in,the,little,dressing,room,off,gerald's,room,<END>
he,said,nothing,of,leaving,tara,and,scarlett,was,careful,not,to,question,him,fearful,that,he,might,leave,them,<END>
sometimes,she,thought,that,if,he,were,anybody,and,had,any,gumption,he,would,go,home,even,if,he,no,longer,had,a,home,<END>
but,even,with,this,thought,she,would,pray,fervently,that,he,would,remain,indefinitely,<END>
it,was,so,convenient,to,have,a,man,about,the,house,<END>
she,thought,too,that,if,carreen,had,the,sense,of,a,mouse,she,would,see,that,will,cared,for,her,<END>
scarlett,would,have,been,eternally,grateful,to,will,had,he,asked,her,for,carreen's,hand,<END>
of,course,before,the,war,will,would,certainly,not,have,been,an,eligible,suitor,<END>
he,was,not,of,the,planter,class,at,all,though,he,was,not,poor,white,<END>
he,was,just,plain,cracker,a,small,farmer,half-educated,prone,to,grammatical,errors,and,ignorant,of,some,of,the,finer,manners,the,o'haras,were,accustomed,to,in,gentlemen,<END>
in,fact,scarlett,wondered,if,he,could,be,called,a,gentleman,at,all,and,decided,that,he,couldn't,<END>
melanie,hotly,defended,him,saying,that,anyone,who,had,will's,kind,heart,and,thoughtfulness,of,others,was,of,gentle,birth,<END>
scarlett,knew,that,ellen,would,have,fainted,at,the,thought,of,a,daughter,of,hers,marrying,such,a,man,but,now,scarlett,had,been,by,necessity,forced,too,far,away,from,ellen's,teachings,to,let,that,worry,her,<END>
men,were,scarce,girls,had,to,marry,someone,and,tara,had,to,have,a,man,<END>
but,carreen,deeper,and,deeper,immersed,in,her,prayer,book,and,every,day,losing,more,of,her,touch,with,the,world,of,realities,treated,will,as,gently,as,a,brother,and,took,him,as,much,for,granted,as,she,did,pork,<END>
if,carreen,had,any,sense,of,gratitude,to,me,for,what,i've,done,for,her,she'd,marry,him,and,not,let,him,get,away,from,here,scarlett,thought,indignantly,<END>
but,no,she,must,spend,her,time,mooning,about,a,silly,boy,who,probably,never,gave,her,a,serious,thought,<END>
so,will,remained,at,tara,for,what,reason,she,did,not,know,and,she,found,his,businesslike,man-to-man,attitude,with,her,both,pleasant,and,helpful,<END>
he,was,gravely,deferential,to,the,vague,gerald,but,it,was,to,scarlett,that,he,turned,as,the,real,head,of,the,house,<END>
she,gave,her,approval,to,the,plan,of,hiring,out,the,horse,even,though,it,meant,the,family,would,be,without,any,means,of,transportation,temporarily,<END>
suellen,would,be,especially,grieved,at,this,<END>
her,greatest,joy,lay,in,going,to,jonesboro,or,fayetteville,with,will,when,he,drove,over,on,business,<END>
adorned,in,the,assembled,best,of,the,family,she,called,on,old,friends,heard,all,the,gossip,of,the,county,and,felt,herself,again,miss,o'hara,of,tara,<END>
suellen,never,missed,the,opportunity,to,leave,the,plantation,and,give,herself,airs,among,people,who,did,not,know,she,weeded,the,garden,and,made,beds,<END>
miss,fine,airs,will,just,have,to,do,without,gadding,for,two,weeks,thought,scarlett,and,we'll,have,to,put,up,with,her,nagging,and,her,bawling,<END>
melanie,joined,them,on,the,veranda,the,baby,in,her,arms,and,spreading,an,old,blanket,on,the,floor,set,little,beau,down,to,crawl,<END>
since,ashley's,letter,melanie,had,divided,her,time,between,glowing,singing,happiness,and,anxious,longing,<END>
but,happy,or,depressed,she,was,too,thin,too,white,<END>
she,did,her,share,of,the,work,uncomplainingly,but,she,was,always,ailing,<END>
old,dr,fontaine,diagnosed,her,trouble,as,female,complaint,and,concurred,with,dr,meade,in,saying,she,should,never,have,had,beau,<END>
and,he,said,frankly,that,another,baby,would,kill,her,<END>
when,i,was,over,to,fayetteville,today,said,will,i,found,somethin',right,cute,that,i,thought,would,interest,you,ladies,and,i,brought,it,home,<END>
he,fumbled,in,his,back,pants,pocket,and,brought,out,the,wallet,of,calico,stiffened,with,bark,which,carreen,had,made,him,<END>
from,it,he,drew,a,confederate,bill,<END>
if,you,think,confederate,money,is,cute,will,i,certainly,don't,said,scarlett,shortly,for,the,very,sight,of,confederate,money,made,her,mad,<END>
we've,got,three,thousand,dollars,of,it,in,pa's,trunk,this,minute,and,mammy's,after,me,to,let,her,paste,it,over,the,holes,in,the,attic,walls,so,the,draft,won't,get,her,<END>
and,i,think,i'll,do,it,<END>

oh,melly,don't,be,sentimental,<END>
paper,is,paper,and,we've,got,little,enough,of,it,and,i'm,tired,of,hearing,mammy,grumble,about,the,cracks,in,the,attic,<END>

scarlett,followed,his,gaze,and,saw,a,familiar,sight,a,bearded,man,coming,slowly,up,the,avenue,under,the,cedars,a,man,clad,in,a,ragged,mixture,of,blue,and,gray,uniforms,head,bowed,tiredly,feet,dragging,slowly,<END>

melanie,rose,<END>

she,stopped,so,suddenly,that,scarlett,turned,to,look,at,her,<END>
melanie's,thin,hand,was,at,her,throat,clutching,it,as,if,it,was,torn,with,pain,and,scarlett,could,see,the,veins,beneath,the,white,skin,throbbing,swiftly,<END>
her,face,went,whiter,and,her,brown,eyes,dilated,enormously,<END>
she's,going,to,faint,thought,scarlett,leaping,to,her,feet,and,catching,her,arm,<END>
but,in,an,instant,melanie,threw,off,her,hand,and,was,down,the,steps,<END>
down,the,graveled,path,she,flew,skimming,lightly,as,a,bird,her,faded,skirts,streaming,behind,her,her,arms,outstretched,<END>
then,scarlett,knew,the,truth,with,the,impact,of,a,blow,<END>
she,reeled,back,against,an,upright,of,the,porch,as,the,man,lifted,a,face,covered,with,a,dirty,blond,beard,and,stopped,still,looking,toward,the,house,as,if,he,was,too,weary,to,take,another,step,<END>
her,heart,leaped,and,stopped,and,then,began,racing,as,melly,with,incoherent,cries,threw,herself,into,the,dirty,soldier's,arms,and,his,head,bent,down,toward,hers,<END>
with,rapture,scarlett,took,two,running,steps,forward,but,was,checked,when,will's,hand,closed,upon,her,skirt,<END>
don't,spoil,it,he,said,quietly,<END>
turn,me,loose,you,fool,<END>
turn,me,loose,<END>

he,did,not,relax,his,grip,<END>
after,all,he's,her,husband,ain't,he,<END>

part,four,<END>
chapter,xxxi,<END>
on,a,cold,january,afternoon,in,1866,scarlett,sat,in,the,office,writing,a,letter,to,aunt,pitty,explaining,in,detail,for,the,tenth,time,why,neither,she,melanie,nor,ashley,could,come,back,to,atlanta,to,live,with,her,<END>
she,wrote,impatiently,because,she,knew,aunt,pitty,would,read,no,farther,than,the,opening,lines,and,then,write,her,again,wailing,but,i'm,afraid,to,live,by,myself,<END>
her,hands,were,chilled,and,she,paused,to,rub,them,together,and,to,scuff,her,feet,deeper,into,the,strip,of,old,quilting,wrapped,about,them,<END>
the,soles,of,her,slippers,were,practically,gone,and,were,reinforced,with,pieces,of,carpet,<END>
the,carpet,kept,her,feet,off,the,floor,but,did,little,to,keep,them,warm,<END>
that,morning,will,had,taken,the,horse,to,jonesboro,to,get,him,shod,<END>
scarlett,thought,grimly,that,things,were,indeed,at,a,pretty,pass,when,horses,had,shoes,and,people's,feet,were,as,bare,as,yard,dogs',<END>
she,picked,up,her,quill,to,resume,her,writing,but,laid,it,down,when,she,heard,will,coming,in,at,the,back,door,<END>
she,heard,the,thump-,thump,of,his,wooden,leg,in,the,hall,outside,the,office,and,then,he,stopped,<END>
she,waited,for,a,moment,for,him,to,enter,and,when,he,made,no,move,she,called,to,him,<END>
he,came,in,his,ears,red,from,the,cold,his,pinkish,hair,awry,and,stood,looking,down,at,her,a,faintly,humorous,smile,on,his,lips,<END>
miss,scarlett,he,questioned,just,how,much,cash,money,have,you,got,<END>
are,you,going,to,try,to,marry,me,for,my,money,will,<END>
she,asked,somewhat,crossly,<END>
no,ma'm,<END>
but,i,just,wanted,to,know,<END>
she,stared,at,him,inquiringly,<END>
will,didn't,look,serious,but,then,he,never,looked,serious,<END>
however,she,felt,that,something,was,wrong,<END>
i've,got,ten,dollars,in,gold,she,said,<END>
the,last,of,that,yankee's,money,<END>
well,ma'm,that,won't,be,enough,<END>
enough,for,what,<END>
enough,for,the,taxes,he,answered,and,stumping,over,to,the,fireplace,he,leaned,down,and,held,his,red,hands,to,the,blaze,<END>
taxes,<END>
she,repeated,<END>
name,of,god,will,<END>
we've,already,paid,the,taxes,<END>
yes'm,<END>
but,they,say,you,didn't,pay,enough,<END>
i,heard,about,it,today,over,to,jonesboro,<END>
but,will,i,can't,understand,<END>
what,do,you,mean,<END>
miss,scarlett,i,sure,hate,to,bother,you,with,more,trouble,when,you've,had,your,share,but,i've,got,to,tell,you,<END>
they,say,you,ought,to,paid,lots,more,taxes,than,you,did,<END>
they're,runnin',the,assessment,up,on,tara,sky,high,higher,than,any,in,the,county,i'll,be,bound,<END>
but,they,can't,make,us,pay,more,taxes,when,we've,already,paid,them,once,<END>
miss,scarlett,you,don't,never,go,to,jonesboro,often,and,i'm,glad,you,don't,<END>
it,ain't,no,place,for,a,lady,these,days,<END>
but,if,you'd,been,there,much,you'd,know,there's,a,mighty,rough,bunch,of,scallawags,and,republicans,and,carpetbaggers,been,runnin',things,recently,<END>
they'd,make,you,mad,enough,to,pop,<END>
and,then,too,niggers,pushin',white,folks,off,the,sidewalks,and,<END>
but,what's,that,got,to,do,with,our,taxes,<END>
i'm,gettin',to,it,miss,scarlett,<END>
for,some,reason,the,rascals,have,histed,the,taxes,on,tara,till,you'd,think,it,was,a,thousand-,bale,place,<END>
after,i,heard,about,it,i,sorter,oozed,around,the,barrooms,pickin',up,gossip,and,i,found,out,that,somebody,wants,to,buy,in,tara,cheap,at,the,sheriff's,sale,if,you,can't,pay,the,extra,taxes,<END>
and,everybody,knows,pretty,well,that,you,can't,pay,them,<END>
i,don't,know,yet,who,it,is,wants,this,place,<END>
i,couldn't,find,out,<END>
but,i,think,that,pusillanimous,feller,hilton,that,married,miss,cathleen,knows,because,he,laughed,kind,of,nasty,when,i,tried,to,sound,him,out,<END>
will,sat,down,on,the,sofa,and,rubbed,the,stump,of,his,leg,<END>
it,ached,in,cold,weather,and,the,wooden,peg,was,neither,well,padded,nor,comfortable,<END>
scarlett,looked,at,him,wildly,<END>
his,manner,was,so,casual,when,he,was,sounding,the,death,knell,of,tara,<END>
sold,out,at,the,sheriff's,sale,<END>
where,would,they,all,go,<END>
and,tara,belonging,to,some,one,else,<END>
no,that,was,unthinkable,<END>
she,had,been,so,engrossed,with,the,job,of,making,tara,produce,she,had,paid,little,heed,to,what,was,going,on,in,the,world,outside,<END>
now,that,she,had,will,and,ashley,to,attend,to,whatever,business,she,might,have,in,jonesboro,and,fayetteville,she,seldom,left,the,plantation,<END>
and,even,as,she,had,listened,with,deaf,ears,to,her,father's,war,talk,in,the,days,before,the,war,came,so,she,had,paid,little,heed,to,will,and,ashley's,discussions,around,the,table,after,supper,about,the,beginnings,of,reconstruction,<END>
oh,of,course,she,knew,about,the,scallawags,southerners,who,had,turned,republican,very,profitably,and,the,carpetbaggers,those,yankees,who,came,south,like,buzzards,after,the,surrender,with,all,their,worldly,possessions,in,one,carpetbag,<END>
and,she,had,had,a,few,unpleasant,experiences,with,the,freedmen's,bureau,<END>
she,had,gathered,also,that,some,of,the,free,negroes,were,getting,quite,insolent,<END>
this,last,she,could,hardly,believe,for,she,had,never,seen,an,insolent,negro,in,her,life,<END>
but,there,were,many,things,which,will,and,ashley,had,conspired,to,keep,from,her,<END>
the,scourge,of,war,had,been,followed,by,the,worse,scourge,of,reconstruction,but,the,two,men,had,agreed,not,to,mention,the,more,alarming,details,when,they,discussed,the,situation,at,home,<END>
and,when,scarlett,took,the,trouble,to,listen,to,them,at,all,most,of,what,they,said,went,in,one,ear,and,out,the,other,<END>
she,had,heard,ashley,say,that,the,south,was,being,treated,as,a,conquered,province,and,that,vindictiveness,was,the,dominant,policy,of,the,conquerors,<END>
but,that,was,the,kind,of,statement,which,meant,less,than,nothing,at,all,to,scarlett,<END>
politics,was,men's,business,<END>
she,had,heard,will,say,it,looked,to,him,like,the,north,just,wasn't,aiming,to,let,the,south,get,on,its,feet,again,<END>
well,thought,scarlett,men,always,had,to,have,something,foolish,to,worry,about,<END>
as,far,as,she,was,concerned,the,yankees,hadn't,whipped,her,once,and,they,wouldn't,do,it,this,time,<END>
the,thing,to,do,was,to,work,like,the,devil,and,stop,worrying,about,the,yankee,government,<END>
after,all,the,war,was,over,<END>
scarlett,did,not,realize,that,all,the,rules,of,the,game,had,been,changed,and,that,honest,labor,could,no,longer,earn,its,just,reward,<END>
georgia,was,virtually,under,martial,law,now,<END>
the,yankee,soldiers,garrisoned,throughout,the,section,and,the,freedmen's,bureau,were,in,complete,command,of,everything,and,they,were,fixing,the,rules,to,suit,themselves,<END>
this,bureau,organized,by,the,federal,government,to,take,care,of,the,idle,and,excited,ex-slaves,was,drawing,them,from,the,plantations,into,the,villages,and,cities,by,the,thousands,<END>
the,bureau,fed,them,while,they,loafed,and,poisoned,their,minds,against,their,former,owners,<END>
gerald's,old,overseer,jonas,wilkerson,was,in,charge,of,the,local,bureau,and,his,assistant,was,hilton,cathleen,calvert's,husband,<END>
these,two,industriously,spread,the,rumor,that,the,southerners,and,democrats,were,just,waiting,for,a,good,chance,to,put,the,negroes,back,into,slavery,and,that,the,negroes',only,hope,of,escaping,this,fate,was,the,protection,given,them,by,the,bureau,and,the,republican,party,<END>
wilkerson,and,hilton,furthermore,told,the,negroes,they,were,as,good,as,the,whites,in,every,way,and,soon,white,and,negro,marriages,would,be,permitted,soon,the,estates,of,their,former,owners,would,be,divided,and,every,negro,would,be,given,forty,acres,and,a,mule,for,his,own,<END>
they,kept,the,negroes,stirred,up,with,tales,of,cruelty,perpetrated,by,the,whites,and,in,a,section,long,famed,for,the,affectionate,relations,between,slaves,and,slave,owners,hate,and,suspicion,began,to,grow,<END>
the,bureau,was,backed,up,by,the,soldiers,and,the,military,had,issued,many,and,conflicting,orders,governing,the,conduct,of,the,conquered,<END>
it,was,easy,to,get,arrested,even,for,snubbing,the,officials,of,the,bureau,<END>
military,orders,had,been,promulgated,concerning,the,schools,sanitation,the,kind,of,buttons,one,wore,on,one's,suit,the,sale,of,commodities,and,nearly,everything,else,<END>
wilkerson,and,hilton,had,the,power,to,interfere,in,any,trade,scarlett,might,make,and,to,fix,their,own,prices,on,anything,she,sold,or,swapped,<END>
fortunately,scarlett,had,come,into,contact,with,the,two,men,very,little,for,will,had,persuaded,her,to,let,him,handle,the,trading,while,she,managed,the,plantation,<END>
in,his,mild-tempered,way,will,had,straightened,out,several,difficulties,of,this,kind,and,said,nothing,to,her,about,them,<END>
will,could,get,along,with,carpetbaggers,and,yankees,if,he,had,to,<END>
but,now,a,problem,had,arisen,which,was,too,big,for,him,to,handle,<END>
the,extra,tax,assessment,and,the,danger,of,losing,tara,were,matters,scarlett,had,to,know,about,and,right,away,<END>
she,looked,at,him,with,flashing,eyes,<END>
oh,damn,the,yankees,<END>
she,cried,<END>
isn't,it,enough,that,they've,licked,us,and,beggared,us,without,turning,loose,scoundrels,on,us,<END>
the,war,was,over,peace,had,been,declared,but,the,yankees,could,still,rob,her,they,could,still,starve,her,they,could,still,drive,her,from,her,house,<END>
and,fool,that,she,was,she,had,thought,through,weary,months,that,if,she,could,just,hold,out,until,spring,everything,would,be,all,right,<END>
this,crushing,news,brought,by,will,coming,on,top,of,a,year,of,back-breaking,work,and,hope,deferred,was,the,last,straw,<END>
oh,will,and,i,thought,our,troubles,were,all,over,when,the,war,ended,<END>
no'm,<END>
will,raised,his,lantern-jawed,country-looking,face,and,gave,her,a,long,steady,look,<END>
our,troubles,are,just,gettin',started,<END>
how,much,extra,taxes,do,they,want,us,to,pay,<END>
three,hundred,dollars,<END>
she,was,struck,dumb,for,a,moment,<END>
three,hundred,dollars,<END>
it,might,just,as,well,be,three,million,dollars,<END>
why,she,floundered,why,why,then,we've,got,to,raise,three,hundred,somehow,<END>
yes'm,and,a,rainbow,and,a,moon,or,two,<END>
oh,but,will,<END>
they,couldn't,sell,out,tara,<END>
why,<END>
his,mild,pale,eyes,showed,more,hate,and,bitterness,than,she,thought,possible,<END>
oh,couldn't,they,<END>
well,they,could,and,they,will,and,they'll,like,doin',it,<END>
miss,scarlett,the,country's,gone,plumb,to,hell,if,you'll,pardon,me,<END>
those,carpetbaggers,and,scallawags,can,vote,and,most,of,us,democrats,can't,<END>

i,ain't,goin',to,take,their,oath,even,if,i,don't,never,vote,again,but,scum,like,that,hilton,feller,he,can,vote,and,scoundrels,like,jonas,wilkerson,and,pore,whites,like,the,slatterys,and,no-counts,like,the,macintoshes,they,can,vote,<END>
and,they're,runnin',things,now,<END>
and,if,they,want,to,come,down,on,you,for,extra,taxes,a,dozen,times,they,can,do,it,<END>
just,like,a,nigger,can,kill,a,white,man,and,not,get,hung,or,he,paused,embarrassed,and,the,memory,of,what,had,happened,to,a,lone,white,woman,on,an,isolated,farm,near,lovejoy,was,in,both,their,minds,<END>
those,niggers,can,do,anything,against,us,and,the,freedmen's,bureau,and,the,soldiers,will,back,them,up,with,guns,and,we,can't,vote,or,do,nothin',about,it,<END>

if,you've,got,ten,dollars,in,gold,i,take,oath,that's,more,than,most,folks,have,got,<END>
they,were,silent,again,and,scarlett,felt,as,if,she,were,butting,her,head,against,a,stone,wall,<END>
there,had,been,so,many,stone,walls,to,butt,against,this,last,year,<END>
what,are,we,goin',to,do,miss,scarlett,<END>
i,don't,know,she,said,dully,and,felt,that,she,didn't,care,<END>

at,the,end,of,every,struggle,it,seemed,that,defeat,was,waiting,to,mock,her,<END>

where,is,mr,wilkes,<END>
perhaps,he'll,have,some,suggestion,<END>
will,turned,his,mild,gaze,on,her,and,she,felt,as,from,the,first,day,when,ashley,came,home,that,he,knew,everything,<END>
he's,down,in,the,orchard,splittin',rails,<END>

better,get,your,shawl,miss,scarlett,<END>
it's,raw,outside,<END>
but,she,went,without,the,shawl,for,it,was,upstairs,and,her,need,to,see,ashley,and,lay,her,troubles,before,him,was,too,urgent,to,wait,<END>

never,once,since,his,return,had,she,had,a,private,word,with,him,<END>

the,sight,of,that,happy,possessive,gesture,had,aroused,in,scarlett,all,the,jealous,animosity,which,had,slumbered,during,the,months,when,she,had,thought,ashley,probably,dead,<END>
now,she,was,determined,to,see,him,alone,<END>

she,went,through,the,orchard,under,the,bare,boughs,and,the,damp,weeds,beneath,them,wet,her,feet,<END>
she,could,hear,the,sound,of,the,axe,ringing,as,ashley,split,into,rails,the,logs,hauled,from,the,swamp,<END>
replacing,the,fences,the,yankees,had,so,blithely,burned,was,a,long,hard,task,<END>
everything,was,a,long,hard,task,she,thought,wearily,and,she,was,tired,of,it,tired,and,mad,and,sick,of,it,all,<END>
if,only,ashley,were,her,husband,instead,of,melanie's,how,sweet,it,would,be,to,go,to,him,and,lay,her,head,upon,his,shoulder,and,cry,and,shove,her,burdens,onto,him,to,work,out,as,best,he,might,<END>
she,rounded,a,thicket,of,pomegranate,trees,which,were,shaking,bare,limbs,in,the,cold,wind,and,saw,him,leaning,on,his,axe,wiping,his,forehead,with,the,back,of,his,hand,<END>
he,was,wearing,the,remains,of,his,butternut,trousers,and,one,of,gerald's,shirts,a,shirt,which,in,better,times,went,only,to,court,days,and,barbecues,a,ruffled,shirt,which,was,far,too,short,for,its,present,owner,<END>
he,had,hung,his,coat,on,a,tree,limb,for,the,work,was,hot,and,he,stood,resting,as,she,came,up,to,him,<END>
at,the,sight,of,ashley,in,rags,with,an,axe,in,his,hand,her,heart,went,out,in,a,surge,of,love,and,of,fury,at,fate,<END>
she,could,not,bear,to,see,him,in,tatters,working,her,debonaire,immaculate,ashley,<END>
his,hands,were,not,made,for,work,or,his,body,for,anything,but,broadcloth,and,fine,linen,<END>
god,intended,him,to,sit,in,a,great,house,talking,with,pleasant,people,playing,the,piano,and,writing,things,which,sounded,beautiful,and,made,no,sense,whatsoever,<END>
she,could,endure,the,sight,of,her,own,child,in,aprons,made,of,sacking,and,the,girls,in,dingy,old,gingham,could,bear,it,that,will,worked,harder,than,any,field,hand,but,not,ashley,<END>
he,was,too,fine,for,all,this,too,infinitely,dear,to,her,<END>
she,would,rather,split,logs,herself,than,suffer,while,he,did,it,<END>
they,say,abe,lincoln,got,his,start,splitting,rails,he,said,as,she,came,up,to,him,<END>
just,think,to,what,heights,i,may,climb,<END>
she,frowned,<END>
he,was,always,saying,light,things,like,this,about,their,hardships,<END>
they,were,deadly,serious,matters,to,her,and,sometimes,she,was,almost,irritated,at,his,remarks,<END>
abruptly,she,told,him,will's,news,tersely,and,in,short,words,feeling,a,sense,of,relief,as,she,spoke,<END>
surely,he'd,have,something,helpful,to,offer,<END>
he,said,nothing,but,seeing,her,shiver,he,took,his,coat,and,placed,it,about,her,shoulders,<END>
well,she,said,finally,doesn't,it,occur,to,you,that,we'll,have,to,get,the,money,somewhere,<END>
yes,he,said,but,where,<END>
i'm,asking,you,she,replied,annoyed,<END>
the,sense,of,relief,at,unburdening,herself,had,disappeared,<END>
even,if,he,couldn't,help,why,didn't,he,say,something,comforting,even,if,it,was,only,oh,i'm,so,sorry,<END>
he,smiled,<END>
in,all,these,months,since,i've,been,home,i've,only,heard,of,one,person,rhett,butler,who,actually,has,money,he,said,<END>
aunt,pittypat,had,written,melanie,the,week,before,that,rhett,was,back,in,atlanta,with,a,carriage,and,two,fine,horses,and,pocketfuls,of,greenbacks,<END>
she,had,intimated,however,that,he,didn't,come,by,them,honestly,<END>
aunt,pitty,had,a,theory,largely,shared,by,atlanta,that,rhett,had,managed,to,get,away,with,the,mythical,millions,of,the,confederate,treasury,<END>
don't,let's,talk,about,him,said,scarlett,shortly,<END>
he's,a,skunk,if,ever,there,was,one,<END>
what's,to,become,of,us,all,<END>
ashley,put,down,the,axe,and,looked,away,and,his,eyes,seemed,to,be,journeying,to,some,far-off,country,where,she,could,not,follow,<END>
i,wonder,he,said,<END>
i,wonder,not,only,what,will,become,of,us,at,tara,but,what,will,become,of,everybody,in,the,south,<END>
she,felt,like,snapping,out,abruptly,to,hell,with,everybody,in,the,south,<END>
what,about,us,<END>
but,she,remained,silent,because,the,tired,feeling,was,back,on,her,more,strongly,than,ever,<END>
ashley,wasn't,being,any,help,at,all,<END>
in,the,end,what,will,happen,will,be,what,has,happened,whenever,a,civilization,breaks,up,<END>
the,people,who,have,brains,and,courage,come,through,and,the,ones,who,haven't,are,winnowed,out,<END>
at,least,it,has,been,interesting,if,not,comfortable,to,witness,a,gotterdammerung,<END>
a,what,<END>
a,dusk,of,the,gods,<END>
unfortunately,we,southerners,did,think,we,were,gods,<END>
for,heaven's,sake,ashley,wilkes,<END>
don't,stand,there,and,talk,nonsense,at,me,when,it's,us,who,are,going,to,be,winnowed,out,<END>
something,of,her,exasperated,weariness,seemed,to,penetrate,his,mind,calling,it,back,from,its,wanderings,for,he,raised,her,hands,with,tenderness,and,turning,them,palm,up,looked,at,the,calluses,<END>
these,are,the,most,beautiful,hands,i,know,he,said,and,kissed,each,palm,lightly,<END>
they,are,beautiful,because,they,are,strong,and,every,callus,is,a,medal,scarlett,every,blister,an,award,for,bravery,and,unselfishness,<END>
they've,been,roughened,for,all,of,us,your,father,the,girls,melanie,the,baby,the,negroes,and,for,me,<END>
my,dear,i,know,what,you,are,thinking,<END>
you're,thinking,'here,stands,an,impractical,fool,talking,tommyrot,about,dead,gods,when,living,people,are,in,danger,',<END>
isn't,that,true,<END>
she,nodded,wishing,he,would,keep,on,holding,her,hands,forever,but,he,dropped,them,<END>
and,you,came,to,me,hoping,i,could,help,you,<END>
well,i,can't,<END>
his,eyes,were,bitter,as,he,looked,toward,the,axe,and,the,pile,of,logs,<END>
my,home,is,gone,and,all,the,money,that,i,so,took,for,granted,i,never,realized,i,had,it,<END>
and,i,am,fitted,for,nothing,in,this,world,for,the,world,i,belonged,in,has,gone,<END>
i,can't,help,you,scarlett,except,by,learning,with,as,good,grace,as,possible,to,be,a,clumsy,farmer,<END>
and,that,won't,keep,tara,for,you,<END>
don't,you,think,i,realize,the,bitterness,of,our,situation,living,here,on,your,charity,oh,yes,scarlett,your,charity,<END>
i,can,never,repay,you,what,you've,done,for,me,and,for,mine,out,of,the,kindness,of,your,heart,<END>
i,realize,it,more,acutely,every,day,<END>
and,every,day,i,see,more,clearly,how,helpless,i,am,to,cope,with,what,has,come,on,us,all,every,day,my,accursed,shrinking,from,realities,makes,it,harder,for,me,to,face,the,new,realities,<END>
do,you,know,what,i,mean,<END>
she,nodded,<END>
she,had,no,very,clear,idea,what,he,meant,but,she,clung,breathlessly,on,his,words,<END>
this,was,the,first,time,he,had,ever,spoken,to,her,of,the,things,he,was,thinking,when,he,seemed,so,remote,from,her,<END>
it,excited,her,as,if,she,were,on,the,brink,of,a,discovery,<END>
it's,a,curse,this,not,wanting,to,look,on,naked,realities,<END>
until,the,war,life,was,never,more,real,to,me,than,a,shadow,show,on,a,curtain,<END>
and,i,preferred,it,so,<END>
i,do,not,like,the,outlines,of,things,to,be,too,sharp,<END>
i,like,them,gently,blurred,a,little,hazy,<END>
he,stopped,and,smiled,faintly,shivering,a,little,as,the,cold,wind,went,through,his,thin,shirt,<END>
in,other,words,scarlett,i,am,a,coward,<END>
his,talk,of,shadow,shows,and,hazy,outlines,conveyed,no,meaning,to,her,but,his,last,words,were,in,language,she,could,understand,<END>
she,knew,they,were,untrue,<END>
cowardice,was,not,in,him,<END>
every,line,of,his,slender,body,spoke,of,generations,of,brave,and,gallant,men,and,scarlett,knew,his,war,record,by,heart,<END>
why,that's,not,so,<END>
would,a,coward,have,climbed,on,the,cannon,at,gettysburg,and,rallied,the,men,<END>
would,the,general,himself,have,written,melanie,a,letter,about,a,coward,<END>
and,<END>
that's,not,courage,he,said,tiredly,<END>
fighting,is,like,champagne,<END>
it,goes,to,the,heads,of,cowards,as,quickly,as,of,heroes,<END>
any,fool,can,be,brave,on,a,battle,field,when,it's,be,brave,or,else,be,killed,<END>
i'm,talking,of,something,else,<END>
and,my,kind,of,cowardice,is,infinitely,worse,than,if,i,had,run,the,first,time,i,heard,a,cannon,fired,<END>
his,words,came,slowly,and,with,difficulty,as,if,it,hurt,to,speak,them,and,he,seemed,to,stand,off,and,look,with,a,sad,heart,at,what,he,had,said,<END>
had,any,other,man,spoken,so,scarlett,would,have,dismissed,such,protestations,contemptuously,as,mock,modesty,and,a,bid,for,praise,<END>
but,ashley,seemed,to,mean,them,and,there,was,a,look,in,his,eyes,which,eluded,her,not,fear,not,apology,but,the,bracing,to,a,strain,which,was,inevitable,and,overwhelming,<END>
the,wintry,wind,swept,her,damp,ankles,and,she,shivered,again,but,her,shiver,was,less,from,the,wind,than,from,the,dread,his,words,evoked,in,her,heart,<END>
but,ashley,what,are,you,afraid,of,<END>
oh,nameless,things,<END>
things,which,sound,very,silly,when,they,are,put,into,words,<END>
mostly,of,having,life,suddenly,become,too,real,of,being,brought,into,personal,too,personal,contact,with,some,of,the,simple,facts,of,life,<END>
it,isn't,that,i,mind,splitting,logs,here,in,the,mud,but,i,do,mind,what,it,stands,for,<END>
i,do,mind,very,much,the,loss,of,the,beauty,of,the,old,life,i,loved,<END>
scarlett,before,the,war,life,was,beautiful,<END>
there,was,a,glamor,to,it,a,perfection,and,a,completeness,and,a,symmetry,to,it,like,grecian,art,<END>
maybe,it,wasn't,so,to,everyone,<END>
i,know,that,now,<END>
but,to,me,living,at,twelve,oaks,there,was,a,real,beauty,to,living,<END>
i,belonged,in,that,life,<END>
i,was,a,part,of,it,<END>
and,now,it,is,gone,and,i,am,out,of,place,in,this,new,life,and,i,am,afraid,<END>
now,i,know,that,in,the,old,days,it,was,a,shadow,show,i,watched,<END>
i,avoided,everything,which,was,not,shadowy,people,and,situations,which,were,too,real,too,vital,<END>
i,resented,their,intrusion,<END>
i,tried,to,avoid,you,too,scarlett,<END>
you,were,too,full,of,living,and,too,real,and,i,was,cowardly,enough,to,prefer,shadows,and,dreams,<END>
but,but,melly,<END>
melanie,is,the,gentlest,of,dreams,and,a,part,of,my,dreaming,<END>
and,if,the,war,had,not,come,i,would,have,lived,out,my,life,happily,buried,at,twelve,oaks,contentedly,watching,life,go,by,and,never,being,a,part,of,it,<END>
but,when,the,war,came,life,as,it,really,is,thrust,itself,against,me,<END>
the,first,time,i,went,into,action,it,was,at,bull,run,you,remember,i,saw,my,boyhood,friends,blown,to,bits,and,heard,dying,horses,scream,and,learned,the,sickeningly,horrible,feeling,of,seeing,men,crumple,up,and,spit,blood,when,i,shot,them,<END>
but,those,weren't,the,worst,things,about,the,war,scarlett,<END>
the,worst,thing,about,the,war,was,the,people,i,had,to,live,with,<END>
i,had,sheltered,myself,from,people,all,my,life,i,had,carefully,selected,my,few,friends,<END>
but,the,war,taught,me,i,had,created,a,world,of,my,own,with,dream,people,in,it,<END>
it,taught,me,what,people,really,are,but,it,didn't,teach,me,how,to,live,with,them,<END>
and,i'm,afraid,i'll,never,learn,<END>
now,i,know,that,in,order,to,support,my,wife,and,child,i,will,have,to,make,my,way,among,a,world,of,people,with,whom,i,have,nothing,in,common,<END>
you,scarlett,are,taking,life,by,the,horns,and,twisting,it,to,your,will,<END>
but,where,do,i,fit,in,the,world,any,more,<END>
i,tell,you,i,am,afraid,<END>
while,his,low,resonant,voice,went,on,desolate,with,a,feeling,she,could,not,understand,scarlett,clutched,at,words,here,and,there,trying,to,make,sense,of,them,<END>
but,the,words,swooped,from,her,hands,like,wild,birds,<END>
something,was,driving,him,driving,him,with,a,cruel,goad,but,she,did,not,understand,what,it,was,<END>
scarlett,i,don't,know,just,when,it,was,that,the,bleak,realization,came,over,me,that,my,own,private,shadow,show,was,over,<END>
perhaps,in,the,first,five,minutes,at,bull,run,when,i,saw,the,first,man,i,killed,drop,to,the,ground,<END>
but,i,knew,it,was,over,and,i,could,no,longer,be,a,spectator,<END>
no,i,suddenly,found,myself,on,the,curtain,an,actor,posturing,and,making,futile,gestures,<END>
my,little,inner,world,was,gone,invaded,by,people,whose,thoughts,were,not,my,thoughts,whose,actions,were,as,alien,as,a,hottentot's,<END>
they'd,tramped,through,my,world,with,slimy,feet,and,there,was,no,place,left,where,i,could,take,refuge,when,things,became,too,bad,to,stand,<END>
when,i,was,in,prison,i,thought,when,the,war,is,over,i,can,go,back,to,the,old,life,and,the,old,dreams,and,watch,the,shadow,show,again,<END>
but,scarlett,there's,no,going,back,<END>
and,this,which,is,facing,all,of,us,now,is,worse,than,war,and,worse,than,prison,and,to,me,worse,than,death,<END>
so,you,see,scarlett,i'm,being,punished,for,being,afraid,<END>
but,ashley,she,began,floundering,in,a,quagmire,of,bewilderment,if,you're,afraid,we'll,starve,why,why,oh,ashley,we'll,manage,somehow,<END>
i,know,we,will,<END>
for,a,moment,his,eyes,came,back,to,her,wide,and,crystal,gray,and,there,was,admiration,in,them,<END>
then,suddenly,they,were,remote,again,and,she,knew,with,a,sinking,heart,that,he,had,not,been,thinking,about,starving,<END>
they,were,always,like,two,people,talking,to,each,other,in,different,languages,<END>
but,she,loved,him,so,much,that,when,he,withdrew,as,he,had,now,done,it,was,like,the,warm,sun,going,down,and,leaving,her,in,chilly,twilight,dews,<END>
she,wanted,to,catch,him,by,the,shoulders,and,hug,him,to,her,make,him,realize,that,she,was,flesh,and,blood,and,not,something,he,had,read,or,dreamed,<END>
if,she,could,only,feel,that,sense,of,oneness,with,him,for,which,she,had,yearned,since,that,day,so,long,ago,when,he,had,come,home,from,europe,and,stood,on,the,steps,of,tara,and,smiled,up,at,her,<END>
starving's,not,pleasant,he,said,<END>
i,know,for,i've,starved,but,i'm,not,afraid,of,that,<END>
i,am,afraid,of,facing,life,without,the,slow,beauty,of,our,old,world,that,is,gone,<END>
scarlett,thought,despairingly,that,melanie,would,know,what,he,meant,<END>
melly,and,he,were,always,talking,such,foolishness,poetry,and,books,and,dreams,and,moonrays,and,star,dust,<END>
he,was,not,fearing,the,things,she,feared,not,the,gnawing,of,an,empty,stomach,nor,the,keenness,of,the,winter,wind,nor,eviction,from,tara,<END>
he,was,shrinking,before,some,fear,she,had,never,known,and,could,not,imagine,<END>
for,in,god's,name,what,was,there,to,fear,in,this,wreck,of,a,world,but,hunger,and,cold,and,the,loss,of,home,<END>
and,she,had,thought,that,if,she,listened,closely,she,would,know,the,answer,to,ashley,<END>
oh,<END>
she,said,and,the,disappointment,in,her,voice,was,that,of,a,child,who,opens,a,beautifully,wrapped,package,to,find,it,empty,<END>
at,her,tone,he,smiled,ruefully,as,though,apologizing,<END>
forgive,me,scarlett,for,talking,so,<END>
i,can't,make,you,understand,because,you,don't,know,the,meaning,of,fear,<END>
you,have,the,heart,of,a,lion,and,an,utter,lack,of,imagination,and,i,envy,you,both,of,those,qualities,<END>
you'll,never,mind,facing,realities,and,you'll,never,want,to,escape,from,them,as,i,do,<END>
escape,<END>
it,was,as,if,that,were,the,only,understandable,word,he,had,spoken,<END>
ashley,like,her,was,tired,of,the,struggle,and,he,wanted,to,escape,<END>
her,breath,came,fast,<END>
oh,ashley,she,cried,you're,wrong,<END>
i,do,want,to,escape,too,<END>
i,am,so,very,tired,of,it,all,<END>
his,eyebrows,went,up,in,disbelief,and,she,laid,a,hand,feverish,and,urgent,on,his,arm,<END>
listen,to,me,she,began,swiftly,the,words,tumbling,out,one,over,the,other,<END>
i'm,tired,of,it,all,i,tell,you,<END>
bone,tired,and,i'm,not,going,to,stand,it,any,longer,<END>
i've,struggled,for,food,and,for,money,and,i've,weeded,and,hoed,and,picked,cotton,and,i've,even,plowed,until,i,can't,stand,it,another,minute,<END>
i,tell,you,ashley,the,south,is,dead,<END>
it's,dead,<END>
the,yankees,and,the,free,niggers,and,the,carpetbaggers,have,got,it,and,there's,nothing,left,for,us,<END>
ashley,let's,run,away,<END>
he,peered,at,her,sharply,lowering,his,head,to,look,into,her,face,now,flaming,with,color,<END>
yes,let's,run,away,leave,them,all,<END>
i'm,tired,of,working,for,the,folks,<END>
somebody,will,take,care,of,them,<END>
there's,always,somebody,who,takes,care,of,people,who,can't,take,care,of,themselves,<END>
oh,ashley,let's,run,away,you,and,i,we,could,go,to,mexico,they,want,officers,in,the,mexican,army,and,we,could,be,so,happy,there,<END>
i'd,work,for,you,ashley,<END>
i'd,do,anything,for,you,<END>
you,know,you,don't,love,melanie,<END>
he,started,to,speak,a,stricken,look,on,his,face,but,she,stemmed,his,words,with,a,torrent,of,her,own,<END>
you,told,me,you,loved,me,better,than,her,that,day,oh,you,remember,that,day,<END>
and,i,know,you,haven't,changed,<END>
i,can,tell,you,haven't,changed,<END>
and,you've,just,said,she,was,nothing,but,a,dream,oh,ashley,let's,go,away,<END>
i,could,make,you,so,happy,<END>
and,anyway,she,added,venomously,melanie,can't,dr,fontaine,said,she,couldn't,ever,have,any,more,children,and,i,could,give,you,<END>
his,hands,were,on,her,shoulders,so,tightly,that,they,hurt,and,she,stopped,breathless,<END>
we,were,to,forget,that,day,at,twelve,oaks,<END>
do,you,think,i,could,ever,forget,it,<END>
have,you,forgotten,it,<END>
can,you,honestly,say,you,don't,love,me,<END>
he,drew,a,deep,breath,and,answered,quickly,<END>
no,<END>
i,don't,love,you,<END>
that's,a,lie,<END>
even,if,it,is,a,lie,said,ashley,and,his,voice,was,deadly,quiet,it,is,not,something,which,can,be,discussed,<END>
you,mean,<END>
do,you,think,i,could,go,off,and,leave,melanie,and,the,baby,even,if,i,hated,them,both,<END>
break,melanie's,heart,<END>
leave,them,both,to,the,charity,of,friends,<END>
scarlett,are,you,mad,<END>
isn't,there,any,sense,of,loyalty,in,you,<END>
you,couldn't,leave,your,father,and,the,girls,<END>
they're,your,responsibility,just,as,melanie,and,beau,are,mine,and,whether,you,are,tired,or,not,they,are,here,and,you've,got,to,bear,them,<END>
i,could,leave,them,i'm,sick,of,them,tired,of,them,<END>
he,leaned,toward,her,and,for,a,moment,she,thought,with,a,catch,at,her,heart,that,he,was,going,to,take,her,in,his,arms,<END>
but,instead,he,patted,her,arm,and,spoke,as,one,comforting,a,child,<END>
i,know,you're,sick,and,tired,<END>
that's,why,you,are,talking,this,way,<END>
you've,carried,the,load,of,three,men,<END>
but,i'm,going,to,help,you,i,won't,always,be,so,awkward,<END>
there's,only,one,way,you,can,help,me,she,said,dully,and,that's,to,take,me,away,from,here,and,give,us,a,new,start,somewhere,with,a,chance,for,happiness,<END>
there's,nothing,to,keep,us,here,<END>
nothing,he,said,quietly,nothing,except,honor,<END>
she,looked,at,him,with,baffled,longing,and,saw,as,if,for,the,first,time,how,the,crescents,of,his,lashes,were,the,thick,rich,gold,of,ripe,wheat,how,proudly,his,head,sat,upon,his,bared,neck,and,how,the,look,of,race,and,dignity,persisted,in,his,slim,erect,body,even,through,its,grotesque,rags,<END>
her,eyes,met,his,hers,naked,with,pleading,his,remote,as,mountain,lakes,under,gray,skies,<END>
she,saw,in,them,defeat,of,her,wild,dream,her,mad,desires,<END>
heartbreak,and,weariness,sweeping,over,her,she,dropped,her,head,in,her,hands,and,cried,<END>
he,had,never,seen,her,cry,<END>
he,had,never,thought,that,women,of,her,strong,mettle,had,tears,and,a,flood,of,tenderness,and,remorse,swept,him,<END>
he,came,to,her,swiftly,and,in,a,moment,had,her,in,his,arms,cradling,her,comfortingly,pressing,her,black,head,to,his,heart,whispering,dear,<END>
my,brave,dear,don't,<END>
you,mustn't,cry,<END>
at,his,touch,he,felt,her,change,within,his,grip,and,there,was,madness,and,magic,in,the,slim,body,he,held,and,a,hot,soft,glow,in,the,green,eyes,which,looked,up,at,him,<END>
of,a,sudden,it,was,no,longer,bleak,winter,<END>
for,ashley,spring,was,back,again,that,half-,forgotten,balmy,spring,of,green,rustlings,and,murmurings,a,spring,of,ease,and,indolence,careless,days,when,the,desires,of,youth,were,warm,in,his,body,<END>
the,bitter,years,since,then,fell,away,and,he,saw,that,the,lips,turned,up,to,his,were,red,and,trembling,and,he,kissed,her,<END>
there,was,a,curious,low,roaring,sound,in,her,ears,as,of,sea,shells,held,against,them,and,through,the,sound,she,dimly,heard,the,swift,thudding,of,her,heart,<END>
her,body,seemed,to,melt,into,his,and,for,a,timeless,time,they,stood,fused,together,as,his,lips,took,hers,hungrily,as,if,he,could,never,have,enough,<END>
when,he,suddenly,released,her,she,felt,that,she,could,not,stand,alone,and,gripped,the,fence,for,support,<END>
she,raised,eyes,blazing,with,love,and,triumph,to,him,<END>
you,do,love,me,<END>
you,do,love,me,<END>
say,it,say,it,<END>
his,hands,still,rested,on,her,shoulders,and,she,felt,them,tremble,and,loved,their,trembling,<END>
she,leaned,toward,him,ardently,but,he,held,her,away,from,him,looking,at,her,with,eyes,from,which,all,remoteness,had,fled,eyes,tormented,with,struggle,and,despair,<END>
don't,<END>
he,said,<END>
don't,<END>
if,you,do,i,shall,take,you,now,here,<END>
she,smiled,a,bright,hot,smile,which,was,forgetful,of,time,or,place,or,anything,but,the,memory,of,his,mouth,on,hers,<END>
suddenly,he,shook,her,shook,her,until,her,black,hair,tumbled,down,about,her,shoulders,shook,her,as,if,in,a,mad,rage,at,her,and,at,himself,<END>
we,won't,do,this,<END>
he,said,<END>
i,tell,you,we,won't,do,it,<END>
it,seemed,as,if,her,neck,would,snap,if,he,shook,her,again,<END>
she,was,blinded,by,her,hair,and,stunned,by,his,action,<END>
she,wrenched,herself,away,and,stared,at,him,<END>
there,were,small,beads,of,moisture,on,his,forehead,and,his,fists,were,curled,into,claws,as,if,in,pain,<END>
he,looked,at,her,directly,his,gray,eyes,piercing,<END>
it's,all,my,fault,none,of,yours,and,it,will,never,happen,again,because,i,am,going,to,take,melanie,and,the,baby,and,go,<END>
go,<END>
she,cried,in,anguish,<END>
oh,no,<END>
yes,by,god,<END>
do,you,think,i'll,stay,here,after,this,<END>
when,this,might,happen,again,<END>
but,ashley,you,can't,go,<END>
why,should,you,go,<END>
you,love,me,<END>
you,want,me,to,say,it,<END>
all,right,i'll,say,it,<END>
i,love,you,<END>
he,leaned,over,her,with,a,sudden,savagery,which,made,her,shrink,back,against,the,fence,<END>
i,love,you,your,courage,and,your,stubbornness,and,your,fire,and,your,utter,ruthlessness,<END>
how,much,do,i,love,you,<END>
so,much,that,a,moment,ago,i,would,have,outraged,the,hospitality,of,the,house,which,has,sheltered,me,and,my,family,forgotten,the,best,wife,any,man,ever,had,enough,to,take,you,here,in,the,mud,like,a,<END>
she,struggled,with,a,chaos,of,thoughts,and,there,was,a,cold,pain,in,her,heart,as,if,an,icicle,had,pierced,it,<END>
she,said,haltingly,if,you,felt,like,that,and,didn't,take,me,then,you,don't,love,me,<END>
i,can,never,make,you,understand,<END>
they,fell,silent,and,looked,at,each,other,<END>
suddenly,scarlett,shivered,and,saw,as,if,coming,back,from,a,long,journey,that,it,was,winter,and,the,fields,were,bare,and,harsh,with,stubble,and,she,was,very,cold,<END>
she,saw,too,that,the,old,aloof,face,of,ashley,the,one,she,knew,so,well,had,come,back,and,it,was,wintry,too,and,harsh,with,hurt,and,remorse,<END>
she,would,have,turned,and,left,him,then,seeking,the,shelter,of,the,house,to,hide,herself,but,she,was,too,tired,to,move,<END>
even,speech,was,a,labor,and,a,weariness,<END>
there,is,nothing,left,she,said,at,last,<END>
nothing,left,for,me,<END>
nothing,to,love,<END>
nothing,to,fight,for,<END>
you,are,gone,and,tara,is,going,<END>
he,looked,at,her,for,a,long,space,and,then,leaning,scooped,up,a,small,wad,of,red,clay,from,the,ground,<END>
yes,there,is,something,left,he,said,and,the,ghost,of,his,old,smile,came,back,the,smile,which,mocked,himself,as,well,as,her,<END>
something,you,love,better,than,me,though,you,may,not,know,it,<END>
you've,still,got,tara,<END>
he,took,her,limp,hand,and,pressed,the,damp,clay,into,it,and,closed,her,fingers,about,it,<END>
there,was,no,fever,in,his,hands,now,nor,in,hers,<END>
she,looked,at,the,red,soil,for,a,moment,and,it,meant,nothing,to,her,<END>
she,looked,at,him,and,realized,dimly,that,there,was,an,integrity,of,spirit,in,him,which,was,not,to,be,torn,apart,by,her,passionate,hands,nor,by,any,hands,<END>
if,it,killed,him,he,would,never,leave,melanie,<END>
if,he,burned,for,scarlett,until,the,end,of,his,days,he,would,never,take,her,and,he,would,fight,to,keep,her,at,a,distance,<END>
she,would,never,again,get,through,that,armor,<END>
the,words,hospitality,and,loyalty,and,honor,meant,more,to,him,than,she,did,<END>
the,clay,was,cold,in,her,hand,and,she,looked,at,it,again,<END>
yes,she,said,i've,still,got,this,<END>
at,first,the,words,meant,nothing,and,the,clay,was,only,red,clay,<END>
but,unbidden,came,the,thought,of,the,sea,of,red,dirt,which,surrounded,tara,and,how,very,dear,it,was,and,how,hard,she,had,fought,to,keep,it,how,hard,she,was,going,to,have,to,fight,if,she,wished,to,keep,it,hereafter,<END>
she,looked,at,him,again,and,wondered,where,the,hot,flood,of,feeling,had,gone,<END>
she,could,think,but,could,not,feel,not,about,him,nor,tara,either,for,she,was,drained,of,all,emotion,<END>
you,need,not,go,she,said,clearly,<END>
i,won't,have,you,all,starve,simply,because,i've,thrown,myself,at,your,head,<END>
it,will,never,happen,again,<END>
she,turned,away,and,started,back,toward,the,house,across,the,rough,fields,twisting,her,hair,into,a,knot,upon,her,neck,<END>
ashley,watched,her,go,and,saw,her,square,her,small,thin,shoulders,as,she,went,<END>
and,that,gesture,went,to,his,heart,more,than,any,words,she,had,spoken,<END>
chapter,xxxii,<END>
she,was,still,clutching,the,ball,of,red,clay,when,she,went,up,the,front,steps,<END>
she,had,carefully,avoided,the,back,entrance,for,mammy's,sharp,eyes,would,certainly,have,seen,that,something,was,greatly,amiss,<END>
scarlett,did,not,want,to,see,mammy,or,anyone,else,<END>
she,did,not,feel,that,she,could,endure,seeing,anyone,or,talking,to,anyone,again,<END>
she,had,no,feeling,of,shame,or,disappointment,or,bitterness,now,only,a,weakness,of,the,knees,and,a,great,emptiness,of,heart,<END>
she,squeezed,the,clay,so,tightly,it,ran,out,from,her,clenched,fist,and,she,said,over,and,over,parrot-like,i've,still,got,this,<END>
yes,i've,still,got,this,<END>
there,was,nothing,else,she,did,have,nothing,but,this,red,land,this,land,she,had,been,willing,to,throw,away,like,a,torn,handkerchief,only,a,few,minutes,before,<END>
now,it,was,dear,to,her,again,and,she,wondered,dully,what,madness,had,possessed,her,to,hold,it,so,lightly,<END>
had,ashley,yielded,she,could,have,gone,away,with,him,and,left,family,and,friends,without,a,backward,look,but,even,in,her,emptiness,she,knew,it,would,have,torn,her,heart,to,leave,these,dear,red,hills,and,long,washed,gullies,and,gaunt,black,pines,<END>
her,thoughts,would,have,turned,back,to,them,hungrily,until,the,day,she,died,<END>
not,even,ashley,could,have,filled,the,empty,spaces,in,her,heart,where,tara,had,been,uprooted,<END>
how,wise,ashley,was,and,how,well,he,knew,her,<END>
he,had,only,to,press,the,damp,earth,into,her,hand,to,bring,her,to,her,senses,<END>
she,was,in,the,hall,preparing,to,close,the,door,when,she,heard,the,sound,of,horse's,hooves,and,turned,to,look,down,the,driveway,<END>
to,have,visitors,at,this,of,all,times,was,too,much,<END>
she'd,hurry,to,her,room,and,plead,a,headache,<END>
but,when,the,carriage,came,nearer,her,flight,was,checked,by,her,amazement,<END>
it,was,a,new,carriage,shiny,with,varnish,and,the,harness,was,new,too,with,bits,of,polished,brass,here,and,there,<END>
strangers,certainly,<END>
no,one,she,knew,had,the,money,for,such,a,grand,new,turn-out,as,this,<END>
she,stood,in,the,doorway,watching,the,cold,draft,blowing,her,skirts,about,her,damp,ankles,<END>
then,the,carriage,stopped,in,front,of,the,house,and,jonas,wilkerson,alighted,<END>
scarlett,was,so,surprised,at,the,sight,of,their,former,overseer,driving,so,fine,a,rig,and,in,so,splendid,a,greatcoat,she,could,not,for,a,moment,believe,her,eyes,<END>
will,had,told,her,he,looked,quite,prosperous,since,he,got,his,new,job,with,the,freedmen's,bureau,<END>
made,a,lot,of,money,will,said,swindling,the,niggers,or,the,government,one,or,tuther,or,confiscating,folks',cotton,and,swearing,it,was,confederate,government,cotton,<END>
certainly,he,never,came,by,all,that,money,honestly,in,these,hard,times,<END>
and,here,he,was,now,stepping,out,of,an,elegant,carriage,and,handing,down,a,woman,dressed,within,an,inch,of,her,life,<END>
scarlett,saw,in,a,glance,that,the,dress,was,bright,in,color,to,the,point,of,vulgarity,but,nevertheless,her,eyes,went,over,the,outfit,hungrily,<END>
it,had,been,so,long,since,she,had,even,seen,stylish,new,clothes,<END>
well,<END>
so,hoops,aren't,so,wide,this,year,she,thought,scanning,the,red,plaid,gown,<END>
and,as,she,took,in,the,black,velvet,paletot,how,short,jackets,are,<END>
and,what,a,cunning,hat,<END>
bonnets,must,be,out,of,style,for,this,hat,was,only,an,absurd,flat,red,velvet,affair,perched,on,the,top,of,the,woman's,head,like,a,stiffened,pancake,<END>
the,ribbons,did,not,tie,under,the,chin,as,bonnet,ribbons,tied,but,in,the,back,under,the,massive,bunch,of,curls,which,fell,from,the,rear,of,the,hat,curls,which,scarlett,could,not,help,noticing,did,not,match,the,woman's,hair,in,either,color,or,texture,<END>
as,the,woman,stepped,to,the,ground,and,looked,toward,the,house,scarlett,saw,there,was,something,familiar,about,the,rabbity,face,caked,with,white,powder,<END>
why,it's,emmie,slattery,<END>
she,cried,so,surprised,she,spoke,the,words,aloud,<END>
yes'm,it's,me,said,emmie,tossing,her,head,with,an,ingratiating,smile,and,starting,toward,the,steps,<END>
emmie,slattery,<END>
the,dirty,tow-headed,slut,whose,illegitimate,baby,ellen,had,baptized,emmie,who,had,given,typhoid,to,ellen,and,killed,her,<END>
this,overdressed,common,nasty,piece,of,poor,white,trash,was,coming,up,the,steps,of,tara,bridling,and,grinning,as,if,she,belonged,here,<END>
scarlett,thought,of,ellen,and,in,a,rush,feeling,came,back,into,the,emptiness,of,her,mind,a,murderous,rage,so,strong,it,shook,her,like,the,ague,<END>
get,off,those,steps,you,trashy,wench,<END>
she,cried,<END>
get,off,this,land,<END>
get,out,<END>
emmie's,jaw,sagged,suddenly,and,she,glanced,at,jonas,who,came,up,with,lowering,brows,<END>
he,made,an,effort,at,dignity,despite,his,anger,<END>
you,must,not,speak,that,way,to,my,wife,he,said,<END>
wife,<END>
said,scarlett,and,burst,into,a,laugh,that,was,cutting,with,contempt,<END>
high,time,you,made,her,your,wife,<END>
who,baptized,your,other,brats,after,you,killed,my,mother,<END>
emmie,said,oh,<END>
and,retreated,hastily,down,the,steps,but,jonas,stopped,her,flight,toward,the,carriage,with,a,rough,grip,on,her,arm,<END>
we,came,out,here,to,pay,a,call,a,friendly,call,he,snarled,<END>
and,talk,a,little,business,with,old,friends,<END>
friends,<END>
scarlett's,voice,was,like,a,whiplash,<END>
when,were,we,ever,friends,with,the,like,of,you,<END>
the,slatterys,lived,on,our,charity,and,paid,it,back,by,killing,mother,and,you,you,pa,discharged,you,about,emmie's,brat,and,you,know,it,<END>
friends,<END>
get,off,this,place,before,i,call,mr,benteen,and,mr,<END>
wilkes,<END>
under,the,words,emmie,broke,her,husband's,hold,and,fled,for,the,carriage,scrambling,in,with,a,flash,of,patent-leather,boots,with,bright-red,tops,and,red,tassels,<END>
now,jonas,shook,with,a,fury,equal,to,scarlett's,and,his,sallow,face,was,as,red,as,an,angry,turkey,gobbler's,<END>
still,high,and,mighty,aren't,you,<END>
well,i,know,all,about,you,<END>
i,know,you,haven't,got,shoes,for,your,feet,<END>
i,know,your,father's,turned,idiot,<END>
get,off,this,place,<END>
oh,you,won't,sing,that,way,very,long,<END>
i,know,you're,broke,<END>
i,know,you,can't,even,pay,your,taxes,<END>
i,came,out,here,to,offer,to,buy,this,place,from,you,to,make,you,a,right,good,offer,<END>
emmie,had,a,hankering,to,live,here,<END>
but,by,god,i,won't,give,you,a,cent,now,<END>
you,highflying,bog-trotting,irish,will,find,out,who's,running,things,around,here,when,you,get,sold,out,for,taxes,<END>
and,i'll,buy,this,place,lock,stock,and,barrel,furniture,and,all,and,i'll,live,in,it,<END>
so,it,was,jonas,wilkerson,who,wanted,tara,jonas,and,emmie,who,in,some,twisted,way,thought,to,even,past,slights,by,living,in,the,home,where,they,had,been,slighted,<END>
all,her,nerves,hummed,with,hate,as,they,had,hummed,that,day,when,she,shoved,the,pistol,barrel,into,the,yankee's,bearded,face,and,fired,<END>
she,wished,she,had,that,pistol,now,<END>
i'll,tear,this,house,down,stone,by,stone,and,burn,it,and,sow,every,acre,with,salt,before,i,see,either,of,you,put,foot,over,this,threshold,she,shouted,<END>
get,out,i,tell,you,<END>
get,out,<END>
jonas,glared,at,her,started,to,say,more,and,then,walked,toward,the,carriage,<END>
he,climbed,in,beside,his,whimpering,wife,and,turned,the,horse,<END>
as,they,drove,off,scarlett,had,the,impulse,to,spit,at,them,<END>
she,did,spit,<END>
she,knew,it,was,a,common,childish,gesture,but,it,made,her,feel,better,<END>
she,wished,she,had,done,it,while,they,could,see,her,<END>
those,damned,nigger,lovers,daring,to,come,here,and,taunt,her,about,her,poverty,<END>
that,hound,never,intended,offering,her,a,price,for,tara,<END>
he,just,used,that,as,an,excuse,to,come,and,flaunt,himself,and,emmie,in,her,face,<END>
the,dirty,scallawags,the,lousy,trashy,poor,whites,boasting,they,would,live,at,tara,<END>
then,sudden,terror,struck,her,and,her,rage,melted,<END>
god's,nightgown,<END>
they,will,come,and,live,here,<END>
there,was,nothing,she,could,do,to,keep,them,from,buying,tara,nothing,to,keep,them,from,levying,on,every,mirror,and,table,and,bed,on,ellen's,shining,mahogany,and,rosewood,and,every,bit,of,it,precious,to,her,scarred,though,it,was,by,the,yankee,raiders,<END>
and,the,robillard,silver,too,<END>
i,won't,let,them,do,it,thought,scarlett,vehemently,<END>
no,not,if,i've,got,to,burn,the,place,down,<END>
emmie,slattery,will,never,set,her,foot,on,a,single,bit,of,flooring,mother,ever,walked,on,<END>
she,closed,the,door,and,leaned,against,it,and,she,was,very,frightened,<END>
more,frightened,even,than,she,had,been,that,day,when,sherman's,army,was,in,the,house,<END>
that,day,the,worst,she,could,fear,was,that,tara,would,be,burned,over,her,head,<END>
but,this,was,worse,these,low,common,creatures,living,in,this,house,bragging,to,their,low,common,friends,how,they,had,turned,the,proud,o'haras,out,<END>
perhaps,they'd,even,bring,negroes,here,to,dine,and,sleep,<END>
will,had,told,her,jonas,made,a,great,to-do,about,being,equal,with,the,negroes,ate,with,them,visited,in,their,houses,rode,them,around,with,him,in,his,carriage,put,his,arms,around,their,shoulders,<END>
when,she,thought,of,the,possibility,of,this,final,insult,to,tara,her,heart,pounded,so,hard,she,could,scarcely,breathe,<END>
she,was,trying,to,get,her,mind,on,her,problem,trying,to,figure,some,way,out,but,each,time,she,collected,her,thoughts,fresh,gusts,of,rage,and,fear,shook,her,<END>
there,must,be,some,way,out,there,must,be,someone,somewhere,who,had,money,she,could,borrow,<END>
money,couldn't,just,dry,up,and,blow,away,<END>
somebody,had,to,have,money,<END>
then,the,laughing,words,of,ashley,came,back,to,her,<END>
only,one,person,rhett,butler,<END>
who,has,money,<END>
rhett,butler,<END>
she,walked,quickly,into,the,parlor,and,shut,the,door,behind,her,<END>
the,dim,gloom,of,drawn,blinds,and,winter,twilight,closed,about,her,<END>
no,one,would,think,of,hunting,for,her,here,and,she,wanted,time,to,think,undisturbed,<END>
the,idea,which,had,just,occurred,to,her,was,so,simple,she,wondered,why,she,had,not,thought,of,it,before,<END>
i'll,get,the,money,from,rhett,<END>
i'll,sell,him,the,diamond,earbobs,<END>
or,i'll,borrow,the,money,from,him,and,let,him,keep,the,earbobs,till,i,can,pay,him,back,<END>
for,a,moment,relief,was,so,great,she,felt,weak,<END>
she,would,pay,the,taxes,and,laugh,in,jonas,wilkerson's,face,<END>
but,close,on,this,happy,thought,came,relentless,knowledge,<END>
it's,not,only,for,this,year,that,i'll,need,tax,money,<END>
there's,next,year,and,all,the,years,of,my,life,<END>
if,i,pay,up,this,time,they'll,raise,the,taxes,higher,next,time,till,they,drive,me,out,<END>
if,i,make,a,good,cotton,crop,they'll,tax,it,till,i'll,get,nothing,for,it,or,maybe,confiscate,it,outright,and,say,it's,confederate,cotton,<END>
the,yankees,and,the,scoundrels,teamed,up,with,them,have,got,me,where,they,want,me,<END>
all,my,life,as,long,as,i,live,i'll,be,afraid,they'll,get,me,somehow,<END>
all,my,life,i'll,be,scared,and,scrambling,for,money,and,working,myself,to,death,only,to,see,my,work,go,for,nothing,and,my,cotton,stolen,<END>
just,borrowing,three,hundred,dollars,for,the,taxes,will,be,only,a,stopgap,<END>
what,i,want,is,to,get,out,of,this,fix,for,good,so,i,can,go,to,sleep,at,night,without,worrying,over,what's,going,to,happen,to,me,tomorrow,and,next,month,and,next,year,<END>
her,mind,ticked,on,steadily,<END>
coldly,and,logically,an,idea,grew,in,her,brain,<END>
she,thought,of,rhett,a,flash,of,white,teeth,against,swarthy,skin,sardonic,black,eyes,caressing,her,<END>
she,recalled,the,hot,night,in,atlanta,close,to,the,end,of,the,siege,when,he,sat,on,aunt,pitty's,porch,half,hidden,in,the,summer,darkness,and,she,felt,again,the,heat,of,his,hand,upon,her,arm,as,he,said,i,want,you,more,than,i,have,ever,wanted,any,woman,and,i've,waited,longer,for,you,than,i've,ever,waited,for,any,woman,<END>
i'll,marry,him,she,thought,coolly,<END>
and,then,i'll,never,have,to,bother,about,money,again,<END>
oh,blessed,thought,sweeter,than,hope,of,heaven,never,to,worry,about,money,again,to,know,that,tara,was,safe,that,the,family,was,fed,and,clothed,that,she,would,never,again,have,to,bruise,herself,against,stone,walls,<END>
she,felt,very,old,<END>

no,there,was,no,emotion,left,in,her,<END>

his,wife,<END>

something,of,repulsion,buried,deep,beneath,her,cold,thinking,stirred,faintly,and,then,was,stilled,<END>

after,all,he,had,once,asked,her,to,be,his,mistress,<END>
in,the,dim,grayness,of,the,parlor,she,fought,a,quick,decisive,battle,with,the,three,most,binding,ties,of,her,soul,the,memory,of,ellen,the,teachings,of,her,religion,and,her,love,for,ashley,<END>
she,knew,that,what,she,had,in,her,mind,must,be,hideous,to,her,mother,even,in,that,warm,far-off,heaven,where,she,surely,was,<END>
she,knew,that,fornication,was,a,mortal,sin,<END>

but,all,these,things,went,down,before,the,merciless,coldness,of,her,mind,and,the,goad,of,desperation,<END>
ellen,was,dead,and,perhaps,death,gave,an,understanding,of,all,things,<END>
religion,forbade,fornication,on,pain,of,hell,fire,but,if,the,church,thought,she,was,going,to,leave,one,stone,unturned,in,saving,tara,and,saving,the,family,from,starving,well,let,the,church,bother,about,that,<END>
she,wouldn't,<END>
at,least,not,now,<END>

yes,he,did,want,her,<END>
the,memory,of,his,warm,mouth,on,hers,told,her,that,<END>
but,he,would,never,take,her,away,with,him,<END>
strange,that,going,away,with,ashley,did,not,seem,like,a,sin,but,with,rhett,<END>
in,the,dull,twilight,of,the,winter,afternoon,she,came,to,the,end,of,the,long,road,which,had,begun,the,night,atlanta,fell,<END>
she,had,set,her,feet,upon,that,road,a,spoiled,selfish,and,untried,girl,full,of,youth,warm,of,emotion,easily,bewildered,by,life,<END>
now,at,the,end,of,the,road,there,was,nothing,left,of,that,girl,<END>
hunger,and,hard,labor,fear,and,constant,strain,the,terrors,of,war,and,the,terrors,of,reconstruction,had,taken,away,all,warmth,and,youth,and,softness,<END>
about,the,core,of,her,being,a,shell,of,hardness,had,formed,and,little,by,little,layer,by,layer,the,shell,had,thickened,during,the,endless,months,<END>

she,had,hoped,that,the,war,being,over,life,would,gradually,resume,its,old,face,<END>
she,had,hoped,that,ashley's,return,would,bring,back,some,meaning,into,life,<END>
now,both,hopes,were,gone,<END>
the,sight,of,jonas,wilkerson,in,the,front,walk,of,tara,had,made,her,realize,that,for,her,for,the,whole,south,the,war,would,never,end,<END>
the,bitterest,fighting,the,most,brutal,retaliations,were,just,beginning,<END>
and,ashley,was,imprisoned,forever,by,words,which,were,stronger,than,any,jail,<END>
peace,had,failed,her,and,ashley,had,failed,her,both,in,the,same,day,and,it,was,as,if,the,last,crevice,in,the,shell,had,been,sealed,the,final,layer,hardened,<END>
she,had,become,what,grandma,fontaine,had,counseled,against,a,woman,who,had,seen,the,worst,and,so,had,nothing,else,to,fear,<END>
not,life,nor,mother,nor,loss,of,love,nor,public,opinion,<END>
only,hunger,and,her,nightmare,dream,of,hunger,could,make,her,afraid,<END>
a,curious,sense,of,lightness,of,freedom,pervaded,her,now,that,she,had,finally,hardened,her,heart,against,all,that,bound,her,to,the,old,days,and,the,old,scarlett,<END>
she,had,made,her,decision,and,thank,god,she,wasn't,afraid,<END>
she,had,nothing,to,lose,and,her,mind,was,made,up,<END>
if,she,could,only,coax,rhett,into,marrying,her,all,would,be,perfect,<END>
but,if,she,couldn't,well,she'd,get,the,money,just,the,same,<END>
for,a,brief,moment,she,wondered,with,impersonal,curiosity,what,would,be,expected,of,a,mistress,<END>
would,rhett,insist,on,keeping,her,in,atlanta,as,people,said,he,kept,the,watling,woman,<END>
if,he,made,her,stay,in,atlanta,he'd,have,to,pay,well,pay,enough,to,balance,what,her,absence,from,tara,would,be,worth,<END>
scarlett,was,very,ignorant,of,the,hidden,side,of,men's,lives,and,had,no,way,of,knowing,just,what,the,arrangement,might,involve,<END>
and,she,wondered,if,she,would,have,a,baby,<END>
that,would,be,distinctly,terrible,<END>
i,won't,think,of,that,now,<END>
i'll,think,of,it,later,and,she,pushed,the,unwelcome,idea,into,the,back,of,her,mind,lest,it,shake,her,resolution,<END>
she'd,tell,the,family,tonight,she,was,going,to,atlanta,to,borrow,money,to,try,to,mortgage,the,farm,if,necessary,<END>
that,would,be,all,they,needed,to,know,until,such,an,evil,day,when,they,might,find,out,differently,<END>
with,the,thought,of,action,her,head,went,up,and,her,shoulders,went,back,<END>
this,affair,was,not,going,to,be,easy,she,knew,<END>
formerly,it,had,been,rhett,who,asked,for,her,favors,and,she,who,held,the,power,<END>
now,she,was,the,beggar,and,a,beggar,in,no,position,to,dictate,terms,<END>
but,i,won't,go,to,him,like,a,beggar,<END>
i'll,go,like,a,queen,granting,favors,<END>
he'll,never,know,<END>
she,walked,to,the,long,pier,glass,and,looked,at,herself,her,head,held,high,<END>
and,she,saw,framed,in,the,cracking,gilt,molding,a,stranger,<END>
it,was,as,if,she,were,really,seeing,herself,for,the,first,time,in,a,year,<END>
she,had,glanced,in,the,mirror,every,morning,to,see,that,her,face,was,clean,and,her,hair,tidy,but,she,had,always,been,too,pressed,by,other,things,to,really,see,herself,<END>
but,this,stranger,<END>
surely,this,thin,hollow-cheeked,woman,couldn't,be,scarlett,o'hara,<END>
scarlett,o'hara,had,a,pretty,coquettish,high-,spirited,face,<END>
this,face,at,which,she,stared,was,not,pretty,at,all,and,had,none,of,the,charm,she,remembered,so,well,<END>
it,was,white,and,strained,and,the,black,brows,above,slanting,green,eyes,swooped,up,startlingly,against,the,white,skin,like,frightened,bird's,wings,<END>
there,was,a,hard,and,hunted,look,about,this,face,<END>
i'm,not,pretty,enough,to,get,him,<END>
she,thought,and,desperation,came,back,to,her,<END>
i'm,thin,oh,i'm,terribly,thin,<END>
she,patted,her,cheeks,felt,frantically,at,her,collar,bones,feeling,them,stand,out,through,her,basque,<END>
and,her,breasts,were,so,small,almost,as,small,as,melanie's,<END>
she'd,have,to,put,ruffles,in,her,bosom,to,make,them,look,larger,and,she,had,always,had,contempt,for,girls,who,resorted,to,such,subterfuges,<END>
ruffles,<END>
that,brought,up,another,thought,<END>
her,clothes,<END>
she,looked,down,at,her,dress,spreading,its,mended,folds,wide,between,her,hands,<END>
rhett,liked,women,who,were,well,dressed,fashionably,dressed,<END>
she,remembered,with,longing,the,flounced,green,dress,she,had,worn,when,she,first,came,out,of,mourning,the,dress,she,wore,with,the,green,plumed,bonnet,he,had,brought,her,and,she,recalled,the,approving,compliments,he,had,paid,her,<END>
she,remembered,too,with,hate,sharpened,by,envy,the,red,plaid,dress,the,red-topped,boots,with,tassels,and,the,pancake,hat,of,emmie,slattery,<END>
they,were,gaudy,but,they,were,new,and,fashionable,and,certainly,they,caught,the,eye,<END>
and,oh,how,she,wanted,to,catch,the,eye,<END>
especially,the,eye,of,rhett,butler,<END>
if,he,should,see,her,in,her,old,clothes,he'd,know,everything,was,wrong,at,tara,<END>
and,he,must,not,know,<END>
what,a,fool,she,had,been,to,think,she,could,go,to,atlanta,and,have,him,for,the,asking,she,with,her,scrawny,neck,and,hungry,cat,eyes,and,raggedy,dress,<END>
if,she,hadn't,been,able,to,pry,a,proposal,from,him,at,the,height,of,her,beauty,when,she,had,her,prettiest,clothes,how,could,she,expect,to,get,one,now,when,she,was,ugly,and,dressed,tackily,<END>
if,miss,pitty's,story,was,true,he,must,have,more,money,than,anyone,in,atlanta,and,probably,had,his,pick,of,all,the,pretty,ladies,good,and,bad,<END>
well,she,thought,grimly,i've,got,something,that,most,pretty,ladies,haven't,got,and,that's,a,mind,that's,made,up,<END>
and,if,i,had,just,one,nice,dress,<END>
there,wasn't,a,nice,dress,in,tara,or,a,dress,which,hadn't,been,turned,twice,and,mended,<END>
that's,that,she,thought,disconsolately,looking,down,at,the,floor,<END>
she,saw,ellen's,moss-green,velvet,carpet,now,worn,and,scuffed,and,torn,and,spotted,from,the,numberless,men,who,had,slept,upon,it,and,the,sight,depressed,her,more,for,it,made,her,realize,that,tara,was,just,as,ragged,as,she,<END>
the,whole,darkening,room,depressed,her,and,going,to,the,window,she,raised,the,sash,unlatched,the,shutters,and,let,the,last,light,of,the,wintry,sunset,into,the,room,<END>
she,closed,the,window,and,leaned,her,head,against,the,velvet,curtains,and,looked,out,across,the,bleak,pasture,toward,the,dark,cedars,of,the,burying,ground,<END>
the,moss-green,velvet,curtains,felt,prickly,and,soft,beneath,her,cheek,and,she,rubbed,her,face,against,them,gratefully,like,a,cat,<END>
and,then,suddenly,she,looked,at,them,<END>
a,minute,later,she,was,dragging,a,heavy,marble-topped,table,across,the,floor,<END>
its,rusty,castors,screeching,in,protest,<END>
she,rolled,the,table,under,the,window,gathered,up,her,skirts,climbed,on,it,and,tiptoed,to,reach,the,heavy,curtain,pole,<END>
it,was,almost,out,of,her,reach,and,she,jerked,at,it,so,impatiently,the,nails,came,out,of,the,wood,and,the,curtains,pole,and,all,fell,to,the,floor,with,a,clatter,<END>
as,if,by,magic,the,door,of,the,parlor,opened,and,the,wide,black,face,of,mammy,appeared,ardent,curiosity,and,deepest,suspicion,evident,in,every,wrinkle,<END>
she,looked,disapprovingly,at,scarlett,poised,on,the,table,top,her,skirts,above,her,knees,ready,to,leap,to,the,floor,<END>
there,was,a,look,of,excitement,and,triumph,on,her,face,which,brought,sudden,distrust,to,mammy,<END>
whut,you,up,to,wid,miss,ellen's,po'teers,<END>

quickly,she,snatched,the,curtain,lengths,from,scarlett,holding,them,against,her,monumental,sagging,breasts,as,if,they,were,holy,relics,<END>

a,cold,wind,was,blowing,stiffly,and,the,scudding,clouds,overhead,were,the,deep,gray,of,slate,when,scarlett,and,mammy,stepped,from,the,train,in,atlanta,the,next,afternoon,<END>
the,depot,had,not,been,rebuilt,since,the,burning,of,the,city,and,they,alighted,amid,cinders,and,mud,a,few,yards,above,the,blackened,ruins,which,marked,the,site,<END>

then,she,caught,herself,with,a,sniff,at,her,own,absent-mindedness,<END>
naturally,peter,wasn't,there,for,she,had,given,aunt,pitty,no,warning,of,her,coming,and,moreover,she,remembered,that,one,of,the,old,lady's,letters,had,dealt,tearfully,with,the,death,of,the,old,nag,peter,had,'quired,in,macon,to,bring,her,back,to,atlanta,after,the,surrender,<END>
she,looked,about,the,rutted,and,cut-up,space,around,the,depot,for,the,equipage,of,some,old,friend,or,acquaintance,who,might,drive,them,to,aunt,pitty's,house,but,she,recognized,no,one,black,or,white,<END>
probably,none,of,her,old,friends,owned,carriages,now,if,what,pitty,had,written,them,was,true,<END>
times,were,so,hard,it,was,difficult,to,feed,and,lodge,humans,much,less,animals,<END>
most,of,pitty's,friends,like,herself,were,afoot,these,days,<END>
there,were,a,few,wagons,loading,at,the,freight,cars,and,several,mud-splashed,buggies,with,rough-looking,strangers,at,the,reins,but,only,two,carriages,<END>
one,was,a,closed,carriage,the,other,open,and,occupied,by,a,well-dressed,woman,and,a,yankee,officer,<END>

the,comparative,emptiness,around,the,train,took,her,mind,back,to,that,morning,in,1862,when,she,had,come,to,atlanta,as,a,young,widow,swathed,in,crepe,and,wild,with,boredom,<END>

she,sighed,for,the,light-hearted,excitement,of,the,war,days,and,sighed,again,at,the,thought,of,walking,all,the,way,to,aunt,pitty's,house,<END>

they,passed,beside,what,had,been,the,atlanta,hotel,where,rhett,and,uncle,henry,had,lived,and,of,that,elegant,hostelry,there,remained,only,a,shell,a,part,of,the,blackened,walls,<END>
the,warehouses,which,had,bordered,the,train,tracks,for,a,quarter,of,a,mile,and,held,tons,of,military,supplies,had,not,been,rebuilt,and,their,rectangular,foundations,looked,dreary,under,the,dark,sky,<END>

despite,all,frank,had,told,her,about,the,town,burning,to,the,ground,she,had,never,really,visualized,complete,destruction,<END>
in,her,mind,the,town,she,loved,so,well,still,stood,full,of,close-packed,buildings,and,fine,houses,<END>

the,lord,stopped,thinking,about,us,years,ago,said,scarlett,savagely,<END>
and,don't,go,telling,me,mother,is,turning,in,her,grave,to,hear,me,say,it,either,<END>
she,wanted,to,feel,superior,and,virtuous,about,belle,but,she,could,not,<END>
if,her,plans,went,well,she,might,be,on,the,same,footing,with,belle,and,supported,by,the,same,man,<END>
while,she,did,not,regret,her,decision,one,whit,the,matter,in,its,true,light,discomfited,her,<END>
i,won't,think,of,it,now,she,told,herself,and,hurried,her,steps,<END>
they,passed,the,lot,where,the,meade,house,had,stood,and,there,remained,of,it,only,a,forlorn,pair,of,stone,steps,and,a,walk,leading,up,to,nothing,<END>
where,the,whitings',home,had,been,was,bare,ground,<END>
even,the,foundation,stones,and,the,brick,chimneys,were,gone,and,there,were,wagon,tracks,where,they,had,been,carted,away,<END>
the,brick,house,of,the,elsings,still,stood,with,a,new,roof,and,a,new,second,floor,<END>
the,bonnell,home,awkwardly,patched,and,roofed,with,rude,boards,instead,of,shingles,managed,to,look,livable,for,all,its,battered,appearance,<END>
but,in,neither,house,was,there,a,face,at,the,window,or,a,figure,on,the,porch,and,scarlett,was,glad,<END>
she,did,not,want,to,talk,to,anyone,now,<END>
then,the,new,slate,roof,of,aunt,pitty's,house,came,in,view,with,its,red-brick,walls,and,scarlett's,heart,throbbed,<END>
how,good,of,the,lord,not,to,level,it,beyond,repair,<END>
coming,out,of,the,front,yard,was,uncle,peter,a,market,basket,on,his,arm,and,when,he,saw,scarlett,and,mammy,trudging,along,a,wide,incredulous,smile,split,his,black,face,<END>
i,could,kiss,the,old,black,fool,i'm,so,glad,to,see,him,thought,scarlett,joyfully,and,she,called,run,get,auntie's,swoon,bottle,peter,<END>
it's,really,me,<END>
that,night,the,inevitable,hominy,and,dried,peas,were,on,aunt,pitty's,supper,table,and,as,scarlett,ate,them,she,made,a,vow,that,these,two,dishes,would,never,appear,on,her,table,when,she,had,money,again,<END>
and,no,matter,what,price,she,had,to,pay,she,was,going,to,have,money,again,more,than,just,enough,to,pay,the,taxes,on,tara,<END>
somehow,some,day,she,was,going,to,have,plenty,of,money,if,she,had,to,commit,murder,to,get,it,<END>
in,the,yellow,lamplight,of,the,dining,room,she,asked,pitty,about,her,finances,hoping,against,hope,that,charles',family,might,be,able,to,lend,her,the,money,she,needed,<END>
the,questions,were,none,too,subtle,but,pitty,in,her,pleasure,at,having,a,member,of,the,family,to,talk,to,did,not,even,notice,the,bald,way,the,questions,were,put,<END>
she,plunged,with,tears,into,the,details,of,her,misfortunes,<END>
she,just,didn't,know,where,her,farms,and,town,property,and,money,had,gone,but,everything,had,slipped,away,<END>
at,least,that,was,what,brother,henry,told,her,<END>
he,hadn't,been,able,to,pay,the,taxes,on,her,estate,<END>
everything,except,the,house,she,was,living,in,was,gone,and,pitty,did,not,stop,to,think,that,the,house,had,never,been,hers,but,was,the,joint,property,of,melanie,and,scarlett,<END>
brother,henry,could,just,barely,pay,taxes,on,this,house,<END>
he,gave,her,a,little,something,every,month,to,live,on,and,though,it,was,very,humiliating,to,take,money,from,him,she,had,to,do,it,<END>
brother,henry,says,he,doesn't,know,how,he'll,make,ends,meet,with,the,load,he's,carrying,and,the,taxes,so,high,but,of,course,he's,probably,lying,and,has,loads,of,money,and,just,won't,give,me,much,<END>
scarlett,knew,uncle,henry,wasn't,lying,<END>
the,few,letters,she,had,had,from,him,in,connection,with,charles',property,showed,that,<END>
the,old,lawyer,was,battling,valiantly,to,save,the,house,and,the,one,piece,of,downtown,property,where,the,warehouse,had,been,so,wade,and,scarlett,would,have,something,left,from,the,wreckage,<END>
scarlett,knew,he,was,carrying,these,taxes,for,her,at,a,great,sacrifice,<END>
of,course,he,hasn't,any,money,thought,scarlett,grimly,<END>
well,check,him,and,aunt,pitty,off,my,list,<END>
there's,nobody,left,but,rhett,<END>
i'll,have,to,do,it,<END>
i,must,do,it,<END>
but,i,mustn't,think,about,it,now,<END>
i,must,get,her,to,talking,about,rhett,so,i,can,casually,suggest,to,her,to,invite,him,to,call,tomorrow,<END>
she,smiled,and,squeezed,the,plump,palms,of,aunt,pitty,between,her,own,<END>
darling,auntie,she,said,don't,let's,talk,about,distressing,things,like,money,any,more,<END>
let's,forget,about,them,and,talk,of,pleasanter,things,<END>
you,must,tell,me,all,the,news,about,our,old,friends,<END>
how,is,mrs,merriwether,and,maybelle,<END>
i,heard,that,maybelle's,little,creole,came,home,safely,<END>
how,are,the,elsings,and,dr,and,mrs,<END>
meade,<END>
pittypat,brightened,at,the,change,of,subject,and,her,baby,face,stopped,quivering,with,tears,<END>
she,gave,detailed,reports,about,old,neighbors,what,they,were,doing,and,wearing,and,eating,and,thinking,<END>
she,told,with,accents,of,horror,how,before,rene,picard,came,home,from,the,war,mrs,merriwether,and,maybelle,had,made,ends,meet,by,baking,pies,and,selling,them,to,the,yankee,soldiers,<END>
imagine,that,<END>
sometimes,there,were,two,dozen,yankees,standing,in,the,back,yard,of,the,merriwether,home,waiting,for,the,baking,to,be,finished,<END>
now,that,rene,was,home,he,drove,an,old,wagon,to,the,yankee,camp,every,day,and,sold,cakes,and,pies,and,beaten,biscuits,to,the,soldiers,<END>
mrs,merriwether,said,that,when,she,made,a,little,more,money,she,was,going,to,open,a,bake,shop,downtown,<END>
pitty,did,not,wish,to,criticize,but,after,all,as,for,herself,said,pitty,she,would,rather,starve,than,have,such,commerce,with,yankees,<END>
she,made,a,point,of,giving,a,disdainful,look,to,every,soldier,she,met,and,crossed,to,the,other,side,of,the,street,in,as,insulting,a,manner,as,possible,though,she,said,this,was,quite,inconvenient,in,wet,weather,<END>
scarlett,gathered,that,no,sacrifice,even,though,it,be,muddy,shoes,was,too,great,to,show,loyalty,to,the,confederacy,in,so,far,as,miss,pittypat,was,concerned,<END>
mrs,meade,and,the,doctor,had,lost,their,home,when,the,yankees,fired,the,town,and,they,had,neither,the,money,nor,the,heart,to,rebuild,now,that,phil,and,darcy,were,dead,<END>
mrs,meade,said,she,never,wanted,a,home,again,for,what,was,a,home,without,children,and,grandchildren,in,it,<END>
they,were,very,lonely,and,had,gone,to,live,with,the,elsings,who,had,rebuilt,the,damaged,part,of,their,home,<END>
mr,and,mrs,whiting,had,a,room,there,too,and,mrs,bonnell,was,talking,of,moving,in,if,she,was,fortunate,enough,to,rent,her,house,to,a,yankee,officer,and,his,family,<END>
but,how,do,they,all,squeeze,in,<END>
cried,scarlett,<END>
there's,mrs,elsing,and,fanny,and,hugh,<END>
mrs,elsing,and,fanny,sleep,in,the,parlor,and,hugh,in,the,attic,explained,pitty,who,knew,the,domestic,arrangements,of,all,her,friends,<END>
my,dear,i,do,hate,to,tell,you,this,but,mrs,<END>
elsing,calls,them,'paying,guests',but,pitty,dropped,her,voice,they,are,really,nothing,at,all,except,boarders,<END>
mrs,elsing,is,running,a,boarding,house,<END>
isn't,that,dreadful,<END>
i,think,it's,wonderful,said,scarlett,shortly,<END>
i,only,wish,we'd,had,'paying,guests',at,tara,for,the,last,year,instead,of,free,boarders,<END>
maybe,we,wouldn't,be,so,poor,now,<END>
scarlett,how,can,you,say,such,things,<END>
your,poor,mother,must,be,turning,in,her,grave,at,the,very,thought,of,charging,money,for,the,hospitality,of,tara,<END>
of,course,mrs,elsing,was,simply,forced,to,it,because,while,she,took,in,fine,sewing,and,fanny,painted,china,and,hugh,made,a,little,money,peddling,firewood,they,couldn't,make,ends,meet,<END>
imagine,darling,hugh,forced,to,peddle,wood,<END>
and,he,all,set,to,be,a,fine,lawyer,<END>
i,could,just,cry,at,the,things,our,boys,are,reduced,to,<END>
scarlett,thought,of,the,rows,of,cotton,beneath,the,glaring,coppery,sky,at,tara,and,how,her,back,had,ached,as,she,bent,over,them,<END>
she,remembered,the,feel,of,plow,handles,between,her,inexperienced,blistered,palms,and,she,felt,that,hugh,elsing,was,deserving,of,no,special,sympathy,<END>
what,an,innocent,old,fool,pitty,was,and,despite,the,ruin,all,around,her,how,sheltered,<END>
if,he,doesn't,like,peddling,why,doesn't,he,practice,law,<END>
or,isn't,there,any,law,practice,left,in,atlanta,<END>
oh,dear,yes,<END>
there's,plenty,of,law,practice,<END>
practically,everybody,is,suing,everybody,else,these,days,<END>
with,everything,burned,down,and,boundary,lines,wiped,out,no,one,knows,just,where,their,land,begins,or,ends,<END>
but,you,can't,get,any,pay,for,suing,because,nobody,has,any,money,<END>
so,hugh,sticks,to,his,peddling,<END>
oh,i,almost,forgot,<END>
did,i,write,you,<END>
fanny,elsing,is,getting,married,tomorrow,night,and,of,course,you,must,attend,<END>
mrs,elsing,will,be,only,too,pleased,to,have,you,when,she,knows,you're,in,town,<END>
i,do,hope,you,have,some,other,frock,besides,that,one,<END>
not,that,it,isn't,a,very,sweet,frock,darling,but,well,it,does,look,a,bit,worn,<END>
oh,you,have,a,pretty,frock,<END>
i'm,so,glad,because,it's,going,to,be,the,first,real,wedding,we've,had,in,atlanta,since,before,the,town,fell,<END>
cake,and,wine,and,dancing,afterward,though,i,don't,know,how,the,elsings,can,afford,it,they,are,so,poor,<END>
who,is,fanny,marrying,<END>
i,thought,after,dallas,mclure,was,killed,at,gettysburg,<END>
darling,you,mustn't,criticize,fanny,<END>
everybody,isn't,as,loyal,to,the,dead,as,you,are,to,poor,charlie,<END>
let,me,see,<END>
what,is,his,name,<END>
i,can,never,remember,names,tom,somebody,<END>
i,knew,his,mother,well,we,went,to,lagrange,female,institute,together,<END>
she,was,a,tomlinson,from,lagrange,and,her,mother,was,let,me,see,<END>
perkins,<END>
parkins,<END>
parkinson,<END>
that's,it,<END>
from,sparta,<END>
a,very,good,family,but,just,the,same,well,i,know,i,shouldn't,say,it,but,i,don't,see,how,fanny,can,bring,herself,to,marry,him,<END>
does,he,drink,or,<END>
dear,no,<END>
his,character,is,perfect,but,you,see,he,was,wounded,low,down,by,a,bursting,shell,and,it,did,something,to,his,legs,makes,them,makes,them,well,i,hate,to,use,the,word,but,it,makes,him,spraddle,<END>
it,gives,him,a,very,vulgar,appearance,when,he,walks,well,it,doesn't,look,very,pretty,<END>
i,don't,see,why,she's,marrying,him,<END>
girls,have,to,marry,someone,<END>
indeed,they,do,not,said,pitty,ruffling,<END>
i,never,had,to,<END>
now,darling,i,didn't,mean,you,<END>
everybody,knows,how,popular,you,were,and,still,are,<END>
why,old,judge,canton,used,to,throw,sheep's,eyes,at,you,till,i,<END>
oh,scarlett,hush,<END>
that,old,fool,<END>
giggled,pitty,good,humor,restored,<END>
but,after,all,fanny,was,so,popular,she,could,have,made,a,better,match,and,i,don't,believe,she,loves,this,tom,what's-,his-name,<END>
i,don't,believe,she's,ever,gotten,over,dallas,mclure,getting,killed,but,she's,not,like,you,darling,<END>
you've,remained,so,faithful,to,dear,charlie,though,you,could,have,married,dozens,of,times,<END>
melly,and,i,have,often,said,how,loyal,you,were,to,his,memory,when,everyone,else,said,you,were,just,a,heartless,coquette,<END>
scarlett,passed,over,this,tactless,confidence,and,skillfully,led,pitty,from,one,friend,to,another,but,all,the,while,she,was,in,a,fever,of,impatience,to,bring,the,conversation,around,to,rhett,<END>
it,would,never,do,for,her,to,ask,outright,about,him,so,soon,after,arriving,<END>
it,might,start,the,old,lady's,mind,to,working,on,channels,better,left,untouched,<END>
there,would,be,time,enough,for,pitty's,suspicions,to,be,aroused,if,rhett,refused,to,marry,her,<END>
aunt,pitty,prattled,on,happily,pleased,as,a,child,at,having,an,audience,<END>
things,in,atlanta,were,in,a,dreadful,pass,she,said,due,to,the,vile,doings,of,the,republicans,<END>
there,was,no,end,to,their,goings,on,and,the,worst,thing,was,the,way,they,were,putting,ideas,in,the,poor,darkies',heads,<END>
my,dear,they,want,to,let,the,darkies,vote,<END>
did,you,ever,hear,of,anything,more,silly,<END>
though,i,don't,know,now,that,i,think,about,it,uncle,peter,has,much,more,sense,than,any,republican,i,ever,saw,and,much,better,manners,but,of,course,uncle,peter,is,far,too,well,bred,to,want,to,vote,<END>
but,the,very,notion,has,upset,the,darkies,till,they're,right,addled,<END>
and,some,of,them,are,so,insolent,<END>
your,life,isn't,safe,on,the,streets,after,dark,and,even,in,the,broad,daylight,they,push,ladies,off,the,sidewalks,into,the,mud,<END>
and,if,any,gentleman,dares,to,protest,they,arrest,him,and,my,dear,did,i,tell,you,that,captain,butler,was,in,jail,<END>
rhett,butler,<END>
even,with,this,startling,news,scarlett,was,grateful,that,aunt,pitty,had,saved,her,the,necessity,of,bringing,his,name,into,the,conversation,herself,<END>
yes,indeed,<END>
excitement,colored,pitty's,cheeks,pink,and,she,sat,upright,<END>
he's,in,jail,this,very,minute,for,killing,a,negro,and,they,may,hang,him,<END>
imagine,captain,butler,hanging,<END>
for,a,moment,the,breath,went,out,of,scarlett's,lungs,in,a,sickening,gasp,and,she,could,only,stare,at,the,fat,old,lady,who,was,so,obviously,pleased,at,the,effect,of,her,statement,<END>
they,haven't,proved,it,yet,but,somebody,killed,this,darky,who,had,insulted,a,white,woman,<END>
and,the,yankees,are,very,upset,because,so,many,uppity,darkies,have,been,killed,recently,<END>
they,can't,prove,it,on,captain,butler,but,they,want,to,make,an,example,of,someone,so,dr,meade,says,<END>
the,doctor,says,that,if,they,do,hang,him,it,will,be,the,first,good,honest,job,the,yankees,ever,did,but,then,i,don't,know,<END>
and,to,think,that,captain,butler,was,here,just,a,week,ago,and,brought,me,the,loveliest,quail,you,ever,saw,for,a,present,and,he,was,asking,about,you,and,saying,he,feared,he,had,offended,you,during,the,siege,and,you,would,never,forgive,him,<END>
how,long,will,he,be,in,jail,<END>
nobody,knows,<END>
perhaps,till,they,hang,him,but,maybe,they,won't,be,able,to,prove,the,killing,on,him,after,all,<END>
however,it,doesn't,seem,to,bother,the,yankees,whether,folks,are,guilty,or,not,so,long,as,they,can,hang,somebody,<END>
they,are,so,upset,pitty,dropped,her,voice,mysteriously,about,the,ku,klux,klan,<END>
do,you,have,the,klan,down,in,the,county,<END>
my,dear,i'm,sure,you,must,and,ashley,just,doesn't,tell,you,girls,anything,about,it,<END>
klansmen,aren't,supposed,to,tell,<END>
they,ride,around,at,night,dressed,up,like,ghosts,and,call,on,carpetbaggers,who,steal,money,and,negroes,who,are,uppity,<END>
sometimes,they,just,scare,them,and,warn,them,to,leave,atlanta,but,when,they,don't,behave,they,whip,them,and,pitty,whispered,sometimes,they,kill,them,and,leave,them,where,they'll,be,easily,found,with,the,ku,klux,card,on,them,<END>
and,the,yankees,are,very,angry,about,it,and,want,to,make,an,example,of,someone,<END>
but,hugh,elsing,told,me,he,didn't,think,they'd,hang,captain,butler,because,the,yankees,think,he,does,know,where,the,money,is,and,just,won't,tell,<END>
they,are,trying,to,make,him,tell,<END>
the,money,<END>
didn't,you,know,<END>
didn't,i,write,you,<END>
my,dear,you,have,been,buried,at,tara,haven't,you,<END>
the,town,simply,buzzed,when,captain,butler,came,back,here,with,a,fine,horse,and,carriage,and,his,pockets,full,of,money,when,all,the,rest,of,us,didn't,know,where,our,next,meal,was,coming,from,<END>
it,simply,made,everybody,furious,that,an,old,speculator,who,always,said,nasty,things,about,the,confederacy,should,have,so,much,money,when,we,were,all,so,poor,<END>
everybody,was,bursting,to,know,how,he,managed,to,save,his,money,but,no,one,had,the,courage,to,ask,him,except,me,and,he,just,laughed,and,said,'in,no,honest,way,you,may,be,sure,',<END>
you,know,how,hard,it,is,to,get,anything,sensible,out,of,him,<END>
but,of,course,he,made,his,money,out,of,the,blockade,<END>
of,course,he,did,honey,some,of,it,<END>
but,that's,not,a,drop,in,the,bucket,to,what,that,man,has,really,got,<END>
everybody,including,the,yankees,believes,he's,got,millions,of,dollars,in,gold,belonging,to,the,confederate,government,hid,out,somewhere,<END>
millions,in,gold,<END>
well,honey,where,did,all,our,confederate,gold,go,to,<END>
somebody,got,it,and,captain,butler,must,be,one,of,the,somebodies,<END>
the,yankees,thought,president,davis,had,it,when,he,left,richmond,but,when,they,captured,the,poor,man,he,had,hardly,a,cent,<END>
there,just,wasn't,any,money,in,the,treasury,when,the,war,was,over,and,everybody,thinks,some,of,the,blockade,runners,got,it,and,are,keeping,quiet,about,it,<END>
millions,in,gold,<END>
but,how,<END>
didn't,captain,butler,take,thousands,of,bales,of,cotton,to,england,and,nassau,to,sell,for,the,confederate,government,<END>
asked,pitty,triumphantly,<END>
not,only,his,own,cotton,but,government,cotton,too,<END>
and,you,know,what,cotton,brought,in,england,during,the,war,<END>
any,price,you,wanted,to,ask,<END>
he,was,a,free,agent,acting,for,the,government,and,he,was,supposed,to,sell,the,cotton,and,buy,guns,with,the,money,and,run,the,guns,in,for,us,<END>
well,when,the,blockade,got,too,tight,he,couldn't,bring,in,the,guns,and,he,couldn't,have,spent,one,one-hundredth,of,the,cotton,money,on,them,anyway,so,there,were,simply,millions,of,dollars,in,english,banks,put,there,by,captain,butler,and,other,blockaders,waiting,till,the,blockade,loosened,<END>
and,you,can't,tell,me,they,banked,that,money,in,the,name,of,the,confederacy,<END>
they,put,it,in,their,own,names,and,it's,still,there,<END>
everybody,has,been,talking,about,it,ever,since,the,surrender,and,criticizing,the,blockaders,severely,and,when,the,yankees,arrested,captain,butler,for,killing,this,darky,they,must,have,heard,the,rumor,because,they've,been,at,him,to,tell,them,where,the,money,is,<END>
you,see,all,of,our,confederate,funds,belong,to,the,yankees,now,at,least,the,yankees,think,so,<END>
but,captain,butler,says,he,doesn't,know,anything,<END>
dr,meade,says,they,ought,to,hang,him,anyhow,only,hanging,is,too,good,for,a,thief,and,a,profiteer,dear,you,look,so,oddly,<END>
do,you,feel,faint,<END>
have,i,upset,you,talking,like,this,<END>
i,knew,he,was,once,a,beau,of,yours,but,i,thought,you'd,fallen,out,long,ago,<END>
personally,i,never,approved,of,him,for,he's,such,a,scamp,<END>
he's,no,friend,of,mine,said,scarlett,with,an,effort,<END>
i,had,a,quarrel,with,him,during,the,siege,after,you,went,to,macon,<END>
where,where,is,he,<END>
in,the,firehouse,over,near,the,public,square,<END>
in,the,firehouse,<END>
aunt,pitty,crowed,with,laughter,<END>
yes,he's,in,the,firehouse,<END>
the,yankees,use,it,for,a,military,jail,now,<END>
the,yankees,are,camped,in,huts,all,round,the,city,hall,in,the,square,and,the,firehouse,is,just,down,the,street,so,that's,where,captain,butler,is,<END>
and,scarlett,i,heard,the,funniest,thing,yesterday,about,captain,butler,<END>
i,forget,who,told,me,<END>
you,know,how,well,groomed,he,always,was,really,a,dandy,and,they've,been,keeping,him,in,the,firehouse,and,not,letting,him,bathe,and,every,day,he's,been,insisting,that,he,wanted,a,bath,and,finally,they,led,him,out,of,his,cell,onto,the,square,and,there,was,a,long,horse,trough,where,the,whole,regiment,had,bathed,in,the,same,water,<END>
and,they,told,him,he,could,bathe,there,and,he,said,no,that,he,preferred,his,own,brand,of,southern,dirt,to,yankee,dirt,and,<END>
scarlett,heard,the,cheerful,babbling,voice,going,on,and,on,but,she,did,not,hear,the,words,<END>
in,her,mind,there,were,only,two,ideas,rhett,had,more,money,than,she,had,even,hoped,and,he,was,in,jail,<END>
the,fact,that,he,was,in,jail,and,possibly,might,be,hanged,changed,the,face,of,matters,somewhat,in,fact,made,them,look,a,little,brighter,<END>
she,had,very,little,feeling,about,rhett,being,hanged,<END>
her,need,of,money,was,too,pressing,too,desperate,for,her,to,bother,about,his,ultimate,fate,<END>
besides,she,half,shared,dr,meade's,opinion,that,hanging,was,too,good,for,him,<END>
any,man,who'd,leave,a,woman,stranded,between,two,armies,in,the,middle,of,the,night,just,to,go,off,and,fight,for,a,cause,already,lost,deserved,hanging,<END>
if,she,could,somehow,manage,to,marry,him,while,he,was,in,jail,all,those,millions,would,be,hers,and,hers,alone,should,he,be,executed,<END>
and,if,marriage,was,not,possible,perhaps,she,could,get,a,loan,from,him,by,promising,to,marry,him,when,he,was,released,or,by,promising,oh,promising,anything,<END>
and,if,they,hanged,him,her,day,of,settlement,would,never,come,<END>
for,a,moment,her,imagination,flamed,at,the,thought,of,being,made,a,widow,by,the,kindly,intervention,of,the,yankee,government,<END>
millions,in,gold,<END>
she,could,repair,tara,and,hire,hands,and,plant,miles,and,miles,of,cotton,<END>
and,she,could,have,pretty,clothes,and,all,she,wanted,to,eat,and,so,could,suellen,and,carreen,<END>
and,wade,could,have,nourishing,food,to,fill,out,his,thin,cheeks,and,warm,clothes,and,a,governess,and,afterward,go,to,the,university,<END>
and,not,grow,up,barefooted,and,ignorant,like,a,cracker,<END>
and,a,good,doctor,could,look,after,pa,and,as,for,ashley,what,couldn't,she,do,for,ashley,<END>
aunt,pittypat's,monologue,broke,off,suddenly,as,she,said,inquiringly,yes,mammy,<END>
and,scarlett,coming,back,from,dreams,saw,mammy,standing,in,the,doorway,her,hands,under,her,apron,and,in,her,eyes,an,alert,piercing,look,<END>
she,wondered,how,long,mammy,had,been,standing,there,and,how,much,she,had,heard,and,observed,<END>
probably,everything,to,judge,by,the,gleam,in,her,old,eyes,<END>
miss,scarlett,look,lak,she,tared,<END>
ah,spec,she,better,go,ter,bed,<END>
i,am,tired,said,scarlett,rising,and,meeting,mammy's,eyes,with,a,childlike,helpless,look,and,i'm,afraid,i'm,catching,a,cold,too,<END>
aunt,pitty,would,you,mind,if,i,stayed,in,bed,tomorrow,and,didn't,go,calling,with,you,<END>
i,can,go,calling,any,time,and,i'm,so,anxious,to,go,to,fanny's,wedding,tomorrow,night,<END>
and,if,my,cold,gets,worse,i,won't,be,able,to,go,<END>
and,a,day,in,bed,would,be,such,a,lovely,treat,for,me,<END>
mammy's,look,changed,to,faint,worry,as,she,felt,scarlett's,hands,and,looked,into,her,face,<END>
she,certainly,didn't,look,well,<END>
the,excitement,of,her,thoughts,had,abruptly,ebbed,leaving,her,white,and,shaking,<END>
yo',han's,lak,ice,honey,<END>
you,come,ter,bed,an',ah'll,brew,you,some,sassfrass,tea,an',git,you,a,hot,brick,ter,mek,you,sweat,<END>
how,thoughtless,i've,been,cried,the,plump,old,lady,hopping,from,her,chair,and,patting,scarlett's,arm,<END>
just,chattering,on,and,not,thinking,of,you,<END>
honey,you,shall,stay,in,bed,all,tomorrow,and,rest,up,and,we,can,gossip,together,oh,dear,no,<END>
i,can't,be,with,you,<END>
i've,promised,to,sit,with,mrs,bonnell,tomorrow,<END>
she,is,down,with,la,grippe,and,so,is,her,cook,<END>
mammy,i'm,so,glad,you,are,here,<END>
you,must,go,over,with,me,in,the,morning,and,help,me,<END>
mammy,hurried,scarlett,up,the,dark,stairs,muttering,fussy,remarks,about,cold,hands,and,thin,shoes,and,scarlett,looked,meek,and,was,well,content,<END>
if,she,could,only,lull,mammy's,suspicions,further,and,get,her,out,of,the,house,in,the,morning,all,would,be,well,<END>
then,she,could,go,to,the,yankee,jail,and,see,rhett,<END>
as,she,climbed,the,stairs,the,faint,rumbling,of,thunder,began,and,standing,on,the,well-remembered,landing,she,thought,how,like,the,siege,cannon,it,sounded,<END>
she,shivered,<END>
forever,thunder,would,mean,cannon,and,war,to,her,<END>
chapter,xxxiv,<END>
the,sun,shone,intermittently,the,next,morning,and,the,hard,wind,that,drove,dark,clouds,swiftly,across,its,face,rattled,the,windowpanes,and,moaned,faintly,about,the,house,<END>
scarlett,said,a,brief,prayer,of,thanksgiving,that,the,rain,of,the,previous,night,had,ceased,for,she,had,lain,awake,listening,to,it,knowing,that,it,would,mean,the,ruin,of,her,velvet,dress,and,new,bonnet,<END>
now,that,she,could,catch,fleeting,glimpses,of,the,sun,her,spirits,soared,<END>
she,could,hardly,remain,in,bed,and,look,languid,and,make,croaking,noises,until,aunt,pitty,mammy,and,uncle,peter,were,out,of,the,house,and,on,their,way,to,mrs,bonnell's,<END>
when,at,last,the,front,gate,banged,and,she,was,alone,in,the,house,except,for,cookie,who,was,singing,in,the,kitchen,she,leaped,from,the,bed,and,lifted,her,new,clothes,from,the,closet,hooks,<END>
sleep,had,refreshed,her,and,given,her,strength,and,from,the,cold,hard,core,at,the,bottom,of,her,heart,she,drew,courage,<END>
there,was,something,about,the,prospect,of,a,struggle,of,wits,with,a,man,with,any,man,that,put,her,on,her,mettle,and,after,months,of,battling,against,countless,discouragements,the,knowledge,that,she,was,at,last,facing,a,definite,adversary,one,whom,she,might,unhorse,by,her,own,efforts,gave,her,a,buoyant,sensation,<END>
dressing,unaided,was,difficult,but,she,finally,accomplished,it,and,putting,on,the,bonnet,with,its,rakish,feathers,she,ran,to,aunt,pitty's,room,to,preen,herself,in,front,of,the,long,mirror,<END>
how,pretty,she,looked,<END>
the,cock,feathers,gave,her,a,dashing,air,and,the,dull-green,velvet,of,the,bonnet,made,her,eyes,startlingly,bright,almost,emerald,colored,<END>
and,the,dress,was,incomparable,so,rich,and,handsome,looking,and,yet,so,dignified,<END>
it,was,wonderful,to,have,a,lovely,dress,again,<END>
it,was,so,nice,to,know,that,she,looked,pretty,and,provocative,and,she,impulsively,bent,forward,and,kissed,her,reflection,in,the,mirror,and,then,laughed,at,her,own,foolishness,<END>
she,picked,up,ellen's,paisley,shawl,to,wrap,about,her,but,the,colors,of,the,faded,old,square,clashed,with,the,moss-green,dress,and,made,her,appear,a,little,shabby,<END>
opening,aunt,pitty's,closet,she,removed,a,black,broadcloth,cloak,a,thin,fall,garment,which,pitty,used,only,for,sunday,wear,and,put,it,on,<END>
she,slipped,into,her,pierced,ears,the,diamond,earrings,she,had,brought,from,tara,and,tossed,her,head,to,observe,the,effect,<END>
they,made,pleasant,clicking,noises,which,were,very,satisfactory,and,she,thought,that,she,must,remember,to,toss,her,head,frequently,when,with,rhett,<END>
dancing,earrings,always,attracted,a,man,and,gave,a,girl,such,a,spirited,air,<END>
what,a,shame,aunt,pitty,had,no,other,gloves,than,the,ones,now,on,her,fat,hands,<END>
no,woman,could,really,feel,like,a,lady,without,gloves,but,scarlett,had,not,had,a,pair,since,she,left,atlanta,<END>
and,the,long,months,of,hard,work,at,tara,had,roughened,her,hands,until,they,were,far,from,pretty,<END>
well,it,couldn't,be,helped,<END>
she'd,take,aunt,pitty's,little,seal,muff,and,hide,her,bare,hands,in,it,<END>
scarlett,felt,that,it,gave,her,the,final,finishing,touch,of,elegance,<END>
no,one,looking,at,her,now,would,suspect,that,poverty,and,want,were,standing,at,her,shoulder,<END>
it,was,so,important,that,rhett,should,not,suspect,<END>
he,must,not,think,that,anything,but,tender,feelings,were,driving,her,<END>
she,tiptoed,down,the,stairs,and,out,of,the,house,while,cookie,bawled,on,unconcernedly,in,the,kitchen,<END>
she,hastened,down,baker,street,to,avoid,the,all,seeing,eyes,of,the,neighbors,and,sat,down,on,a,carriage,block,on,ivy,street,in,front,of,a,burned,house,to,wait,for,some,passing,carriage,or,wagon,which,would,give,her,a,ride,<END>
the,sun,dipped,in,and,out,from,behind,hurrying,clouds,lighting,the,street,with,a,false,brightness,which,had,no,warmth,in,it,and,the,wind,fluttered,the,lace,of,her,pantalets,<END>
it,was,colder,than,she,had,expected,and,she,wrapped,aunt,pitty's,thin,cloak,about,her,and,shivered,impatiently,<END>
just,as,she,was,preparing,to,start,walking,the,long,way,across,town,to,the,yankee,encampment,a,battered,wagon,appeared,<END>
in,it,was,an,old,woman,with,a,lip,full,of,snuff,and,a,weather-beaten,face,under,a,drab,sunbonnet,driving,a,dawdling,old,mule,<END>
she,was,going,in,the,direction,of,the,city,hall,and,she,grudgingly,gave,scarlett,a,ride,<END>
but,it,was,obvious,that,the,dress,bonnet,and,muff,found,no,favor,with,her,<END>
she,thinks,i'm,a,hussy,thought,scarlett,<END>
and,perhaps,she's,right,at,that,<END>
when,at,last,they,reached,the,town,square,and,the,tall,white,cupola,of,the,city,hall,loomed,up,she,made,her,thanks,climbed,down,from,the,wagon,and,watched,the,country,woman,drive,off,<END>
looking,around,carefully,to,see,that,she,was,not,observed,she,pinched,her,cheeks,to,give,them,color,and,bit,her,lips,until,they,stung,to,make,them,red,<END>
she,adjusted,the,bonnet,and,smoothed,back,her,hair,and,looked,about,the,square,<END>
the,two-story,red-brick,city,hall,had,survived,the,burning,of,the,city,<END>
but,it,looked,forlorn,and,unkempt,under,the,gray,sky,<END>
surrounding,the,building,completely,and,covering,the,square,of,land,of,which,it,was,the,center,were,row,after,row,of,army,huts,dingy,and,mud,splashed,<END>
yankee,soldiers,loitered,everywhere,and,scarlett,looked,at,them,uncertainly,some,of,her,courage,deserting,her,<END>
how,would,she,go,about,finding,rhett,in,this,enemy,camp,<END>
she,looked,down,the,street,toward,the,firehouse,and,saw,that,the,wide,arched,doors,were,closed,and,heavily,barred,and,two,sentries,passed,and,repassed,on,each,side,of,the,building,<END>
rhett,was,in,there,<END>
but,what,should,she,say,to,the,yankee,soldiers,<END>
and,what,would,they,say,to,her,<END>
she,squared,her,shoulders,<END>
if,she,hadn't,been,afraid,to,kill,one,yankee,she,shouldn't,fear,merely,talking,to,another,<END>
she,picked,her,way,precariously,across,the,stepping,stones,of,the,muddy,street,and,walked,forward,until,a,sentry,his,blue,overcoat,buttoned,high,against,the,wind,stopped,her,<END>
what,is,it,ma'm,<END>
his,voice,had,a,strange,mid-western,twang,but,it,was,polite,and,respectful,<END>
i,want,to,see,a,man,in,there,he,is,a,prisoner,<END>
well,i,don't,know,said,the,sentry,scratching,his,head,<END>
they,are,mighty,particular,about,visitors,and,he,stopped,and,peered,into,her,face,sharply,<END>
lord,lady,<END>
don't,you,cry,<END>
you,go,over,to,post,headquarters,and,ask,the,officers,<END>
they'll,let,you,see,him,i,bet,<END>
scarlett,who,had,no,intention,of,crying,beamed,at,him,<END>
he,turned,to,another,sentry,who,was,slowly,pacing,his,beat,yee-ah,bill,<END>
come'eer,<END>
the,second,sentry,a,large,man,muffled,in,a,blue,overcoat,from,which,villainous,black,whiskers,burst,came,through,the,mud,toward,them,<END>
you,take,this,lady,to,headquarters,<END>
scarlett,thanked,him,and,followed,the,sentry,<END>
mind,you,don't,turn,your,ankle,on,those,stepping,stones,said,the,soldier,taking,her,arm,<END>
and,you'd,better,hist,up,your,skirts,a,little,to,keep,them,out,of,the,mud,<END>
the,voice,issuing,from,the,whiskers,had,the,same,nasal,twang,but,was,kind,and,pleasant,and,his,hand,was,firm,and,respectful,<END>
why,yankees,weren't,bad,at,all,<END>
it's,a,mighty,cold,day,for,a,lady,to,be,out,in,said,her,escort,<END>
have,you,come,a,fer,piece,<END>
oh,yes,from,clear,across,the,other,side,of,town,she,said,warming,to,the,kindness,in,his,voice,<END>
this,ain't,no,weather,for,a,lady,to,be,out,in,said,the,soldier,reprovingly,with,all,this,la,grippe,in,the,air,<END>
here's,post,command,lady,what's,the,matter,<END>
this,house,this,house,is,your,headquarters,<END>
scarlett,looked,up,at,the,lovely,old,dwelling,facing,on,the,square,and,could,have,cried,<END>
she,had,been,to,so,many,parties,in,this,house,during,the,war,<END>
it,had,been,a,gay,beautiful,place,and,now,there,was,a,large,united,states,flag,floating,over,it,<END>
what's,the,matter,<END>
nothing,only,only,i,used,to,know,the,people,who,lived,here,<END>
well,that's,too,bad,<END>
i,guess,they,wouldn't,know,it,themselves,if,they,saw,it,for,it,shore,is,torn,up,on,the,inside,<END>
now,you,go,on,in,ma'm,and,ask,for,the,captain,<END>
she,went,up,the,steps,caressing,the,broken,white,banisters,and,pushed,open,the,front,door,<END>
the,hall,was,dark,and,as,cold,as,a,vault,and,a,shivering,sentry,was,leaning,against,the,closed,folding,doors,of,what,had,been,in,better,days,the,dining,room,<END>
i,want,to,see,the,captain,she,said,<END>
he,pulled,back,the,doors,and,she,entered,the,room,her,heart,beating,rapidly,her,face,flushing,with,embarrassment,and,excitement,<END>
there,was,a,close,stuffy,smell,in,the,room,compounded,of,the,smoking,fire,tobacco,fumes,leather,damp,woolen,uniforms,and,unwashed,bodies,<END>
she,had,a,confused,impression,of,bare,walls,with,torn,wallpaper,rows,of,blue,overcoats,and,slouch,hats,hung,on,nails,a,roaring,fire,a,long,table,covered,with,papers,and,a,group,of,officers,in,blue,uniforms,with,brass,buttons,<END>
she,gulped,once,and,found,her,voice,<END>
she,mustn't,let,these,yankees,know,she,was,afraid,<END>
she,must,look,and,be,her,prettiest,and,most,unconcerned,self,<END>
the,captain,<END>
i'm,one,captain,said,a,fat,man,whose,tunic,was,unbuttoned,<END>
i,want,to,see,a,prisoner,captain,rhett,butler,<END>
butler,again,<END>
he's,popular,that,man,laughed,the,captain,taking,a,chewed,cigar,from,his,mouth,<END>
you,a,relative,ma'm,<END>
yes,his,his,sister,<END>
he,laughed,again,<END>
he's,got,a,lot,of,sisters,one,of,them,here,yesterday,<END>
scarlett,flushed,<END>
one,of,those,creatures,rhett,consorted,with,probably,that,watling,woman,<END>
and,these,yankees,thought,she,was,another,one,<END>
it,was,unendurable,<END>
not,even,for,tara,would,she,stay,here,another,minute,and,be,insulted,<END>
she,turned,to,the,door,and,reached,angrily,for,the,knob,but,another,officer,was,by,her,side,quickly,<END>
he,was,clean,shaven,and,young,and,had,merry,kind,eyes,<END>
just,a,minute,ma'm,<END>
won't,you,sit,down,here,by,the,fire,where,it's,warm,<END>
i'll,go,see,what,i,can,do,about,it,<END>
what,is,your,name,<END>
he,refused,to,see,the,lady,who,called,yesterday,<END>
she,sank,into,the,proffered,chair,glaring,at,the,discomfited,fat,captain,and,gave,her,name,<END>
the,nice,young,officer,slipped,on,his,overcoat,and,left,the,room,and,the,others,took,themselves,off,to,the,far,end,of,the,table,where,they,talked,in,low,tones,and,pawed,at,the,papers,<END>
she,stretched,her,feet,gratefully,toward,the,fire,realizing,for,the,first,time,how,cold,they,were,and,wishing,she,had,thought,to,put,a,piece,of,cardboard,over,the,hole,in,the,sole,of,one,slipper,<END>
after,a,time,voices,murmured,outside,the,door,and,she,heard,rhett's,laugh,<END>
the,door,opened,a,cold,draft,swept,the,room,and,rhett,appeared,hatless,a,long,cape,thrown,carelessly,across,his,shoulders,<END>
he,was,dirty,and,unshaven,and,without,a,cravat,but,somehow,jaunty,despite,his,dishabille,and,his,dark,eyes,were,snapping,joyfully,at,the,sight,of,her,<END>
scarlett,<END>
he,had,her,hands,in,both,of,his,and,as,always,there,was,something,hot,and,vital,and,exciting,about,his,grip,<END>
before,she,quite,knew,what,he,was,about,he,had,bent,and,kissed,her,cheek,his,mustache,tickling,her,<END>
as,he,felt,the,startled,movement,of,her,body,away,from,him,he,hugged,her,about,the,shoulders,and,said,my,darling,little,sister,<END>
and,grinned,down,at,her,as,if,he,relished,her,helplessness,in,resisting,his,caress,<END>
she,couldn't,help,laughing,back,at,him,for,the,advantage,he,had,taken,<END>
what,a,rogue,he,was,<END>
jail,had,not,changed,him,one,bit,<END>
the,fat,captain,was,muttering,through,his,cigar,to,the,merry-eyed,officer,<END>
most,irregular,<END>
he,should,be,in,the,firehouse,<END>
you,know,the,orders,<END>
oh,for,god's,sake,henry,<END>
the,lady,would,freeze,in,that,barn,<END>
oh,all,right,all,right,<END>
it's,your,responsibility,<END>
i,assure,you,gentlemen,said,rhett,turning,to,them,but,still,keeping,a,grip,on,scarlett's,shoulders,my,sister,hasn't,brought,me,any,saws,or,files,to,help,me,escape,<END>
they,all,laughed,and,as,they,did,scarlett,looked,quickly,about,her,<END>
good,heavens,was,she,going,to,have,to,talk,to,rhett,before,six,yankee,officers,<END>
was,he,so,dangerous,a,prisoner,they,wouldn't,let,him,out,of,their,sight,<END>
seeing,her,anxious,glance,the,nice,officer,pushed,open,a,door,and,spoke,brief,low,words,to,two,privates,who,had,leaped,to,their,feet,at,his,entrance,<END>
they,picked,up,their,rifles,and,went,out,into,the,hall,closing,the,door,behind,them,<END>
if,you,wish,you,may,sit,here,in,the,orderly,room,said,the,young,captain,<END>
and,don't,try,to,bolt,through,that,door,<END>
the,men,are,just,outside,<END>
you,see,what,a,desperate,character,i,am,scarlett,said,rhett,<END>
thank,you,captain,<END>
this,is,most,kind,of,you,<END>
he,bowed,carelessly,and,taking,scarlett's,arm,pulled,her,to,her,feet,and,propelled,her,into,the,dingy,orderly,room,<END>
she,was,never,to,remember,what,the,room,looked,like,except,that,it,was,small,and,dim,and,none,too,warm,and,there,were,handwritten,papers,tacked,on,the,mutilated,walls,and,chairs,which,had,cowhide,seats,with,the,hair,still,on,them,<END>
when,he,had,closed,the,door,behind,them,rhett,came,to,her,swiftly,and,bent,over,her,<END>
knowing,his,desire,she,turned,her,head,quickly,but,smiled,provocatively,at,him,out,of,the,corners,of,her,eyes,<END>
can't,i,really,kiss,you,now,<END>
on,the,forehead,like,a,good,brother,she,answered,demurely,<END>
thank,you,no,<END>
i,prefer,to,wait,and,hope,for,better,things,<END>
his,eyes,sought,her,lips,and,lingered,there,a,moment,<END>
but,how,good,of,you,to,come,to,see,me,scarlett,<END>
you,are,the,first,respectable,citizen,who,has,called,on,me,since,my,incarceration,and,being,in,jail,makes,one,appreciate,friends,<END>
when,did,you,come,to,town,<END>
yesterday,afternoon,<END>
and,you,came,out,this,morning,<END>
why,my,dear,you,are,more,than,good,<END>
he,smiled,down,at,her,with,the,first,expression,of,honest,pleasure,she,had,ever,seen,on,his,face,<END>
scarlett,smiled,inwardly,with,excitement,and,ducked,her,head,as,if,embarrassed,<END>
of,course,i,came,out,right,away,<END>
aunt,pitty,told,me,about,you,last,night,and,i,i,just,couldn't,sleep,all,night,for,thinking,how,awful,it,was,<END>
rhett,i'm,so,distressed,<END>
why,scarlett,<END>
his,voice,was,soft,but,there,was,a,vibrant,note,in,it,and,looking,up,into,his,dark,face,she,saw,in,it,none,of,the,skepticism,the,jeering,humor,she,knew,so,well,<END>
before,his,direct,gaze,her,eyes,fell,again,in,real,confusion,<END>
things,were,going,even,better,than,she,hoped,<END>
it's,worth,being,in,jail,to,see,you,again,and,to,hear,you,say,things,like,that,<END>
i,really,couldn't,believe,my,ears,when,they,brought,me,your,name,<END>
you,see,i,never,expected,you,to,forgive,me,for,my,patriotic,conduct,that,night,on,the,road,near,rough,and,ready,<END>
but,i,take,it,that,this,call,means,you,have,forgiven,me,<END>
she,could,feel,swift,anger,stir,even,at,this,late,date,as,she,thought,of,that,night,but,she,subdued,it,and,tossed,her,head,until,the,earrings,danced,<END>
no,i,haven't,forgiven,you,she,said,and,pouted,<END>
another,hope,crushed,<END>
and,after,i,offered,up,myself,for,my,country,and,fought,barefooted,in,the,snow,at,franklin,and,got,the,finest,case,of,dysentery,you,ever,heard,of,for,my,pains,<END>
i,don't,want,to,hear,about,your,pains,she,said,still,pouting,but,smiling,at,him,from,up-tilted,eyes,<END>
i,still,think,you,were,hateful,that,night,and,i,never,expect,to,forgive,you,<END>
leaving,me,alone,like,that,when,anything,might,have,happened,to,me,<END>
but,nothing,did,happen,to,you,<END>
so,you,see,my,confidence,in,you,was,justified,<END>
i,knew,you'd,get,home,safely,and,god,help,any,yankee,who,got,in,your,way,<END>
rhett,why,on,earth,did,you,do,such,a,silly,thing,enlisting,at,the,last,minute,when,you,knew,we,were,going,to,get,licked,<END>
and,after,all,you'd,said,about,idiots,who,went,out,and,got,shot,<END>
scarlett,spare,me,<END>
i,am,always,overcome,with,shame,when,i,think,about,it,<END>
well,i'm,glad,to,learn,you,are,ashamed,of,the,way,you,treated,me,<END>
you,misunderstand,<END>
i,regret,to,say,that,my,conscience,has,not,troubled,me,at,all,about,deserting,you,<END>
but,as,for,enlisting,when,i,think,of,joining,the,army,in,varnished,boots,and,a,white,linen,suit,and,armed,with,only,a,pair,of,dueling,pistols,and,those,long,cold,miles,in,the,snow,after,my,boots,wore,out,and,i,had,no,overcoat,and,nothing,to,eat,<END>
i,cannot,understand,why,i,did,not,desert,<END>
it,was,all,the,purest,insanity,<END>
but,it's,in,one's,blood,<END>
southerners,can,never,resist,a,losing,cause,<END>
but,never,mind,my,reasons,<END>
it's,enough,that,i'm,forgiven,<END>
you're,not,<END>
i,think,you're,a,hound,<END>
but,she,caressed,the,last,word,until,it,might,have,been,darling,<END>
don't,fib,<END>
you've,forgiven,me,<END>
young,ladies,don't,dare,yankee,sentries,to,see,a,prisoner,just,for,charity's,sweet,sake,and,come,all,dressed,up,in,velvet,and,feathers,and,seal,muffs,too,<END>
scarlett,how,pretty,you,look,<END>
thank,god,you,aren't,in,rags,or,mourning,<END>
i,get,so,sick,of,women,in,dowdy,old,clothes,and,perpetual,crepe,<END>
you,look,like,the,rue,de,la,paix,<END>
turn,around,my,dear,and,let,me,look,at,you,<END>
so,he,had,noticed,the,dress,<END>
of,course,he,would,notice,such,things,being,rhett,<END>
she,laughed,in,soft,excitement,and,spun,about,on,her,toes,her,arms,extended,her,hoops,tilting,up,to,show,her,lace,trimmed,pantalets,<END>
his,black,eyes,took,her,in,from,bonnet,to,heels,in,a,glance,that,missed,nothing,that,old,impudent,unclothing,glance,which,always,gave,her,goose,bumps,<END>
you,look,very,prosperous,and,very,very,tidy,<END>
and,almost,good,enough,to,eat,<END>
if,it,wasn't,for,the,yankees,outside,but,you,are,quite,safe,my,dear,<END>
sit,down,<END>
i,won't,take,advantage,of,you,as,i,did,the,last,time,i,saw,you,<END>
he,rubbed,his,cheek,with,pseudo,ruefulness,<END>
honestly,scarlett,don't,you,think,you,were,a,bit,selfish,that,night,<END>
think,of,all,i,had,done,for,you,risked,my,life,stolen,a,horse,and,such,a,horse,<END>
rushed,to,the,defense,of,our,glorious,cause,<END>
and,what,did,i,get,for,my,pains,<END>
some,hard,words,and,a,very,hard,slap,in,the,face,<END>
she,sat,down,<END>
the,conversation,was,not,going,in,quite,the,direction,she,hoped,<END>
he,had,seemed,so,nice,when,he,first,saw,her,so,genuinely,glad,she,had,come,<END>
he,had,almost,seemed,like,a,human,being,and,not,the,perverse,wretch,she,knew,so,well,<END>
must,you,always,get,something,for,your,pains,<END>
why,of,course,<END>
i,am,a,monster,of,selfishness,as,you,ought,to,know,<END>
i,always,expect,payment,for,anything,i,give,<END>
that,sent,a,slight,chill,through,her,but,she,rallied,and,jingled,her,earbobs,again,<END>
oh,you,really,aren't,so,bad,rhett,<END>
you,just,like,to,show,off,<END>
my,word,but,you,have,changed,<END>
he,said,and,laughed,<END>
what,has,made,a,christian,of,you,<END>
i,have,kept,up,with,you,through,miss,pittypat,but,she,gave,me,no,intimation,that,you,had,developed,womanly,sweetness,<END>
tell,me,more,about,yourself,scarlett,<END>
what,have,you,been,doing,since,i,last,saw,you,<END>
the,old,irritation,and,antagonism,which,he,roused,in,her,was,hot,in,her,heart,and,she,yearned,to,speak,tart,words,<END>
but,she,smiled,instead,and,the,dimple,crept,into,her,cheek,<END>
he,had,drawn,a,chair,close,beside,hers,and,she,leaned,over,and,put,a,gentle,hand,on,his,arm,in,an,unconscious,manner,<END>
oh,i've,been,doing,nicely,thank,you,and,everything,at,tara,is,fine,now,<END>
of,course,we,had,a,dreadful,time,right,after,sherman,went,through,but,after,all,he,didn't,burn,the,house,and,the,darkies,saved,most,of,the,livestock,by,driving,it,into,the,swamp,<END>
and,we,cleared,a,fair,crop,this,last,fall,twenty,bales,<END>
of,course,that's,practically,nothing,compared,with,what,tara,can,do,but,we,haven't,many,field,hands,<END>
pa,says,of,course,we'll,do,better,next,year,<END>
but,rhett,it's,so,dull,in,the,country,now,<END>
imagine,there,aren't,any,balls,or,barbecues,and,the,only,thing,people,talk,about,is,hard,times,<END>
goodness,i,get,sick,of,it,<END>
finally,last,week,i,got,too,bored,to,stand,it,any,longer,so,pa,said,i,must,take,a,trip,and,have,a,good,time,<END>
so,i,came,up,here,to,get,me,some,frocks,made,and,then,i'm,going,over,to,charleston,to,visit,my,aunt,<END>
it'll,be,lovely,to,go,to,balls,again,<END>
there,she,thought,with,pride,i,delivered,that,with,just,the,right,airy,way,<END>
not,too,rich,but,certainly,not,poor,<END>
you,look,beautiful,in,ball,dresses,my,dear,and,you,know,it,too,worse,luck,<END>
i,suppose,the,real,reason,you,are,going,visiting,is,that,you,have,run,through,the,county,swains,and,are,seeking,fresh,ones,in,fields,afar,<END>
scarlett,had,a,thankful,thought,that,rhett,had,spent,the,last,several,months,abroad,and,had,only,recently,come,back,to,atlanta,<END>
otherwise,he,would,never,have,made,so,ridiculous,a,statement,<END>
she,thought,briefly,of,the,county,swains,the,ragged,embittered,little,fontaines,the,poverty-stricken,munroe,boys,the,jonesboro,and,fayetteville,beaux,who,were,so,busy,plowing,splitting,rails,and,nursing,sick,old,animals,that,they,had,forgotten,such,things,as,balls,and,pleasant,flirtations,ever,existed,<END>
but,she,put,down,this,memory,and,giggled,self-consciously,as,if,admitting,the,truth,of,his,assertion,<END>
oh,well,she,said,deprecatingly,<END>
you,are,a,heartless,creature,scarlett,but,perhaps,that's,part,of,your,charm,<END>
he,smiled,in,his,old,way,one,corner,of,his,mouth,curving,down,but,she,knew,he,was,complimenting,her,<END>
for,of,course,you,know,you,have,more,charm,than,the,law,should,permit,<END>
even,i,have,felt,it,case-hardened,though,i,am,<END>
i've,often,wondered,what,it,was,about,you,that,made,me,always,remember,you,for,i've,known,many,ladies,who,were,prettier,than,you,and,certainly,more,clever,and,i,fear,morally,more,upright,and,kind,<END>
but,somehow,i,always,remembered,you,<END>
even,during,the,months,since,the,surrender,when,i,was,in,france,and,england,and,hadn't,seen,you,or,heard,of,you,and,was,enjoying,the,society,of,many,beautiful,ladies,i,always,remembered,you,and,wondered,what,you,were,doing,<END>
for,a,moment,she,was,indignant,that,he,should,say,other,women,were,prettier,more,clever,and,kind,than,she,but,that,momentary,flare,was,wiped,out,in,her,pleasure,that,he,had,remembered,her,and,her,charm,<END>
so,he,hadn't,forgotten,<END>
that,would,make,things,easier,<END>
and,he,was,behaving,so,nicely,almost,like,a,gentleman,would,do,under,the,circumstances,<END>
now,all,she,had,to,do,was,bring,the,subject,around,to,himself,so,she,could,intimate,that,she,had,not,forgotten,him,either,and,then,<END>
she,gently,squeezed,his,arm,and,dimpled,again,<END>
oh,rhett,how,you,do,run,on,teasing,a,country,girl,like,me,<END>
i,know,mighty,well,you,never,gave,me,a,thought,after,you,left,me,that,night,<END>
you,can't,tell,me,you,ever,thought,of,me,with,all,those,pretty,french,and,english,girls,around,you,<END>
but,i,didn't,come,all,the,way,out,here,to,hear,you,talk,foolishness,about,me,<END>
i,came,i,came,because,<END>
because,<END>
oh,rhett,i'm,so,terribly,distressed,about,you,<END>
so,frightened,for,you,<END>
when,will,they,let,you,out,of,that,terrible,place,<END>
he,swiftly,covered,her,hand,with,his,and,held,it,hard,against,his,arm,<END>
your,distress,does,you,credit,<END>
there's,no,telling,when,i'll,be,out,<END>
probably,when,they've,stretched,the,rope,a,bit,more,<END>
the,rope,<END>
yes,i,expect,to,make,my,exit,from,here,at,the,rope's,end,<END>
they,won't,really,hang,you,<END>
they,will,if,they,can,get,a,little,more,evidence,against,me,<END>
oh,rhett,<END>
she,cried,her,hand,at,her,heart,<END>
would,you,be,sorry,<END>
if,you,are,sorry,enough,i'll,mention,you,in,my,will,<END>
his,dark,eyes,laughed,at,her,recklessly,and,he,squeezed,her,hand,<END>
his,will,<END>
she,hastily,cast,down,her,eyes,for,fear,of,betrayal,but,not,swiftly,enough,for,his,eyes,gleamed,suddenly,curious,<END>
according,to,the,yankees,i,ought,to,have,a,fine,will,<END>
there,seems,to,be,considerable,interest,in,my,finances,at,present,<END>
every,day,i,am,hauled,up,before,another,board,of,inquiry,and,asked,foolish,questions,<END>
the,rumor,seems,current,that,i,made,off,with,the,mythical,gold,of,the,confederacy,<END>
well,did,you,<END>
what,a,leading,question,<END>
you,know,as,well,as,i,do,that,the,confederacy,ran,a,printing,press,instead,of,a,mint,<END>
where,did,you,get,all,your,money,<END>
speculating,<END>
aunt,pittypat,said,<END>
what,probing,questions,you,ask,<END>
damn,him,<END>
of,course,he,had,the,money,<END>
she,was,so,excited,it,became,difficult,to,talk,sweetly,to,him,<END>
rhett,i'm,so,upset,about,your,being,here,<END>
don't,you,think,there's,a,chance,of,your,getting,out,<END>
'nihil,desperandum',is,my,motto,<END>
what,does,that,mean,<END>
it,means,'maybe,',my,charming,ignoramus,<END>
she,fluttered,her,thick,lashes,up,to,look,at,him,and,fluttered,them,down,again,<END>
oh,you're,too,smart,to,let,them,hang,you,<END>
i,know,you'll,think,of,some,clever,way,to,beat,them,and,get,out,<END>
and,when,you,do,<END>
and,when,i,do,<END>
he,asked,softly,leaning,closer,<END>
well,i,and,she,managed,a,pretty,confusion,and,a,blush,<END>
the,blush,was,not,difficult,for,she,was,breathless,and,her,heart,was,beating,like,a,drum,<END>
rhett,i'm,so,sorry,about,what,i,i,said,to,you,that,night,you,know,at,rough,and,ready,<END>
i,was,oh,so,very,frightened,and,upset,and,you,were,so,so,she,looked,down,and,saw,his,brown,hand,tighten,over,hers,<END>
and,i,thought,then,that,i'd,never,never,forgive,you,<END>
but,when,aunt,pitty,told,me,yesterday,that,you,that,they,might,hang,you,it,came,over,me,of,a,sudden,and,i,i,she,looked,up,into,his,eyes,with,one,swift,imploring,glance,and,in,it,she,put,an,agony,of,heartbreak,<END>
oh,rhett,i'd,die,if,they,hanged,you,<END>
i,couldn't,bear,it,<END>
you,see,i,and,because,she,could,not,longer,sustain,the,hot,leaping,light,that,was,in,his,eyes,her,lids,fluttered,down,again,<END>
in,a,moment,i'll,be,crying,she,thought,in,a,frenzy,of,wonder,and,excitement,<END>
shall,i,let,myself,cry,<END>
would,that,seem,more,natural,<END>
he,said,quickly,my,god,scarlett,you,can't,mean,that,you,and,his,hands,closed,over,hers,in,so,hard,a,grip,that,it,hurt,<END>
she,shut,her,eyes,tightly,trying,to,squeeze,out,tears,but,remembered,to,turn,her,face,up,slightly,so,he,could,kiss,her,with,no,difficulty,<END>
now,in,an,instant,his,lips,would,be,upon,hers,the,hard,insistent,lips,which,she,suddenly,remembered,with,a,vividness,that,left,her,weak,<END>
but,he,did,not,kiss,her,<END>
disappointment,queerly,stirring,her,she,opened,her,eyes,a,trifle,and,ventured,a,peep,at,him,<END>
his,black,head,was,bent,over,her,hands,and,as,she,watched,he,lifted,one,and,kissed,it,and,taking,the,other,laid,it,against,his,cheek,for,a,moment,<END>
expecting,violence,this,gentle,and,loverlike,gesture,startled,her,<END>
she,wondered,what,expression,was,on,his,face,but,could,not,tell,for,his,head,was,bowed,<END>
she,quickly,lowered,her,gaze,lest,he,should,look,up,suddenly,and,see,the,expression,on,her,face,<END>
she,knew,that,the,feeling,of,triumph,surging,through,her,was,certain,to,be,plain,in,her,eyes,<END>
in,a,moment,he,would,ask,her,to,marry,him,or,at,least,say,that,he,loved,her,and,then,<END>
as,she,watched,him,through,the,veil,of,her,lashes,he,turned,her,hand,over,palm,up,to,kiss,it,too,and,suddenly,he,drew,a,quick,breath,<END>
looking,down,she,saw,her,own,palm,saw,it,as,it,really,was,for,the,first,time,in,a,year,and,a,cold,sinking,fear,gripped,her,<END>
this,was,a,stranger's,palm,not,scarlett,o'hara's,soft,white,dimpled,helpless,one,<END>
this,hand,was,rough,from,work,brown,with,sunburn,splotched,with,freckles,<END>
the,nails,were,broken,and,irregular,there,were,heavy,calluses,on,the,cushions,of,the,palm,a,half-healed,blister,on,the,thumb,<END>
the,red,scar,which,boiling,fat,had,left,last,month,was,ugly,and,glaring,<END>
she,looked,at,it,in,horror,and,before,she,thought,she,swiftly,clenched,her,fist,<END>
still,he,did,not,raise,his,head,<END>
still,she,could,not,see,his,face,<END>
he,pried,her,fist,open,inexorably,and,stared,at,it,picked,up,her,other,hand,and,held,them,both,together,silently,looking,down,at,them,<END>
look,at,me,he,said,finally,raising,his,head,and,his,voice,was,very,quiet,<END>
and,drop,that,demure,expression,<END>
unwillingly,she,met,his,eyes,defiance,and,perturbation,on,her,face,<END>
his,black,brows,were,up,and,his,eyes,gleamed,<END>
so,you,have,been,doing,very,nicely,at,tara,have,you,<END>
cleared,so,much,money,on,the,cotton,you,can,go,visiting,<END>
what,have,you,been,doing,with,your,hands,plowing,<END>
she,tried,to,wrench,them,away,but,he,held,them,hard,running,his,thumbs,over,the,calluses,<END>
these,are,not,the,hands,of,a,lady,he,said,and,tossed,them,into,her,lap,<END>
oh,shut,up,<END>
she,cried,feeling,a,momentary,intense,relief,at,being,able,to,speak,her,feelings,<END>
whose,business,is,it,what,i,do,with,my,hands,<END>
what,a,fool,i,am,she,thought,vehemently,<END>
i,should,have,borrowed,or,stolen,aunt,pitty's,gloves,<END>
but,i,didn't,realize,my,hands,looked,so,bad,<END>
of,course,he,would,notice,them,<END>
and,now,i've,lost,my,temper,and,probably,ruined,everything,<END>
oh,to,have,this,happen,when,he,was,right,at,the,point,of,a,declaration,<END>
your,hands,are,certainly,no,business,of,mine,said,rhett,coolly,and,lounged,back,in,his,chair,indolently,his,face,a,smooth,blank,<END>
so,he,was,going,to,be,difficult,<END>
well,she'd,have,to,bear,it,meekly,much,as,she,disliked,it,if,she,expected,to,snatch,victory,from,this,debacle,<END>
perhaps,if,she,sweet-talked,him,<END>
i,think,you're,real,rude,to,throw,off,on,my,poor,hands,<END>
just,because,i,went,riding,last,week,without,my,gloves,and,ruined,them,<END>
riding,hell,<END>
he,said,in,the,same,level,voice,<END>
you've,been,working,with,those,hands,working,like,a,nigger,<END>
what's,the,answer,<END>
why,did,you,lie,to,me,about,everything,being,nice,at,tara,<END>
now,rhett,<END>
suppose,we,get,down,to,the,truth,<END>
what,is,the,real,purpose,of,your,visit,<END>
almost,i,was,persuaded,by,your,coquettish,airs,that,you,cared,something,about,me,and,were,sorry,for,me,<END>
oh,i,am,sorry,<END>
indeed,<END>
no,you,aren't,<END>
they,can,hang,me,higher,than,haman,for,all,you,care,<END>
it's,written,as,plainly,on,your,face,as,hard,work,is,written,on,your,hands,<END>
you,wanted,something,from,me,and,you,wanted,it,badly,enough,to,put,on,quite,a,show,<END>
why,didn't,you,come,out,in,the,open,and,tell,me,what,it,was,<END>
you'd,have,stood,a,much,better,chance,of,getting,it,for,if,there's,one,virtue,i,value,in,women,it's,frankness,<END>
but,no,you,had,to,come,jingling,your,earbobs,and,pouting,and,frisking,like,a,prostitute,with,a,prospective,client,<END>
he,did,not,raise,his,voice,at,the,last,words,or,emphasize,them,in,any,way,but,to,scarlett,they,cracked,like,a,whiplash,and,with,despair,she,saw,the,end,of,her,hopes,of,getting,him,to,propose,marriage,<END>
had,he,exploded,with,rage,and,injured,vanity,or,upbraided,her,as,other,men,would,have,done,she,could,have,handled,him,<END>
but,the,deadly,quietness,of,his,voice,frightened,her,left,her,utterly,at,a,loss,as,to,her,next,move,<END>
although,he,was,a,prisoner,and,the,yankees,were,in,the,next,room,it,came,to,her,suddenly,that,rhett,butler,was,a,dangerous,man,to,run,afoul,of,<END>
i,suppose,my,memory,is,getting,faulty,<END>
i,should,have,recalled,that,you,are,just,like,me,and,that,you,never,do,anything,without,an,ulterior,motive,<END>
now,let,me,see,<END>
what,could,you,have,had,up,your,sleeve,mrs,hamilton,<END>
it,isn't,possible,that,you,were,so,misguided,as,to,think,i,would,propose,matrimony,<END>
her,face,went,crimson,and,she,did,not,answer,<END>
but,you,can't,have,forgotten,my,oft-repeated,remark,that,i,am,not,a,marrying,man,<END>
when,she,did,not,speak,he,said,with,sudden,violence,<END>
you,hadn't,forgotten,<END>
answer,me,<END>
i,hadn't,forgotten,she,said,wretchedly,<END>
what,a,gambler,you,are,scarlett,he,jeered,<END>
you,took,a,chance,that,my,incarceration,away,from,female,companionship,would,put,me,in,such,a,state,i'd,snap,at,you,like,a,trout,at,a,worm,<END>
and,that's,what,you,did,thought,scarlett,with,inward,rage,and,if,it,hadn't,been,for,my,hands,<END>
now,we,have,most,of,the,truth,everything,except,your,reason,<END>
see,if,you,can,tell,me,the,truth,about,why,you,wanted,to,lead,me,into,wedlock,<END>
there,was,a,suave,almost,teasing,note,in,his,voice,and,she,took,heart,<END>
perhaps,everything,wasn't,lost,after,all,<END>
of,course,she,had,ruined,any,hope,of,marriage,but,even,in,her,despair,she,was,glad,<END>
there,was,something,about,this,immobile,man,which,frightened,her,so,that,now,the,thought,of,marrying,him,was,fearful,<END>
but,perhaps,if,she,was,clever,and,played,on,his,sympathies,and,his,memories,she,could,secure,a,loan,<END>
she,pulled,her,face,into,a,placating,and,childlike,expression,<END>
oh,rhett,you,can,help,me,so,much,if,you'll,just,be,sweet,<END>

what,do,you,want,<END>
money,<END>
the,bluntness,of,his,question,ruined,all,hopes,of,leading,up,to,the,matter,in,any,circuitous,and,sentimental,way,<END>

oh,ye,well,not,so,terribly,but,i,could,use,it,<END>
three,hundred,dollars,<END>
that's,a,vast,amount,of,money,<END>
what,do,you,want,it,for,<END>
to,pay,taxes,on,tara,<END>
so,you,want,to,borrow,some,money,<END>
well,since,you're,so,businesslike,i'll,be,businesslike,too,<END>
what,collateral,will,you,give,me,<END>

collateral,<END>
security,on,my,investment,<END>
of,course,i,don't,want,to,lose,all,that,money,<END>
his,voice,was,deceptively,smooth,almost,silky,but,she,did,not,notice,<END>
maybe,everything,would,turn,out,nicely,after,all,<END>
my,earrings,<END>
i'm,not,interested,in,earrings,<END>
i'll,give,you,a,mortgage,on,tara,<END>

he,tilted,back,in,his,chair,and,stuck,his,hands,in,his,pockets,<END>
cotton,prices,are,dropping,<END>
times,are,so,hard,and,money's,so,tight,<END>
oh,rhett,you,are,teasing,me,<END>
you,know,you,have,millions,<END>
there,was,a,warm,dancing,malice,in,his,eyes,as,he,surveyed,her,<END>
so,everything,is,going,nicely,and,you,don't,need,the,money,very,badly,<END>
well,i'm,glad,to,hear,that,<END>
i,like,to,know,that,all,is,well,with,old,friends,<END>
oh,rhett,for,god's,sake,<END>

i,i,lied,about,everything,being,all,right,<END>
everything's,as,wrong,as,it,could,be,<END>
father,is,is,he's,not,himself,<END>
he's,been,queer,ever,since,mother,died,and,he,can't,help,me,any,<END>
he's,just,like,a,child,<END>
and,we,haven't,a,single,field,hand,to,work,the,cotton,and,there's,so,many,to,feed,thirteen,of,us,<END>
and,the,taxes,they,are,so,high,<END>
rhett,i'll,tell,you,everything,<END>
for,over,a,year,we've,been,just,this,side,of,starvation,<END>
oh,you,don't,know,<END>
you,can't,know,<END>
we've,never,had,enough,to,eat,and,it's,terrible,to,wake,up,hungry,and,go,to,sleep,hungry,<END>
and,we,haven't,any,warm,clothes,and,the,children,are,always,cold,and,sick,and,<END>
where,did,you,get,the,pretty,dress,<END>
it's,made,out,of,mother's,curtains,she,answered,too,desperate,to,lie,about,this,shame,<END>
i,could,stand,being,hungry,and,cold,but,now,now,the,carpetbaggers,have,raised,our,taxes,<END>
and,the,money's,got,to,be,paid,right,away,<END>
and,i,haven't,any,money,except,one,five-dollar,gold,piece,<END>
i've,got,to,have,money,for,the,taxes,<END>
don't,you,see,<END>
if,i,don't,pay,them,i'll,we'll,lose,tara,and,we,just,can't,lose,it,<END>
i,can't,let,it,go,<END>
why,didn't,you,tell,me,all,this,at,first,instead,of,preying,on,my,susceptible,heart,always,weak,where,pretty,ladies,are,concerned,<END>
no,scarlett,don't,cry,<END>
you've,tried,every,trick,except,that,one,and,i,don't,think,i,could,stand,it,<END>
my,feelings,are,already,lacerated,with,disappointment,at,discovering,it,was,my,money,and,not,my,charming,self,you,wanted,<END>
she,remembered,that,he,frequently,told,bald,truths,about,himself,when,he,spoke,mockingly,mocking,himself,as,well,as,others,and,she,hastily,looked,up,at,him,<END>
were,his,feelings,really,hurt,<END>
did,he,really,care,about,her,<END>
had,he,been,on,the,verge,of,a,proposal,when,he,saw,her,palms,<END>
or,had,he,only,been,leading,up,to,another,such,odious,proposal,as,he,had,made,twice,before,<END>
if,he,really,cared,about,her,perhaps,she,could,smooth,him,down,<END>
but,his,black,eyes,raked,her,in,no,lover-like,way,and,he,was,laughing,softly,<END>
i,don't,like,your,collateral,<END>
i'm,no,planter,<END>
what,else,have,you,to,offer,<END>
well,she,had,come,to,it,at,last,<END>
now,for,it,<END>
she,drew,a,deep,breath,and,met,his,eyes,squarely,all,coquetry,and,airs,gone,as,her,spirit,rushed,out,to,grapple,that,which,she,feared,most,<END>
i,i,have,myself,<END>
yes,<END>
her,jaw,line,tightened,to,squareness,and,her,eyes,went,emerald,<END>
you,remember,that,night,on,aunt,pitty's,porch,during,the,siege,<END>
you,said,you,said,then,that,you,wanted,me,<END>
he,leaned,back,carelessly,in,his,chair,and,looked,into,her,tense,face,and,his,own,dark,face,was,inscrutable,<END>
something,flickered,behind,his,eyes,but,he,said,nothing,<END>
you,said,you,said,you'd,never,wanted,a,woman,as,much,as,you,wanted,me,<END>
if,you,still,want,me,you,can,have,me,<END>
rhett,i'll,do,anything,you,say,but,for,god's,sake,write,me,a,draft,for,the,money,<END>
my,word's,good,<END>
i,swear,it,<END>
i,won't,go,back,on,it,<END>
i'll,put,it,in,writing,if,you,like,<END>
he,looked,at,her,oddly,still,inscrutable,and,as,she,hurried,on,she,could,not,tell,if,he,were,amused,or,repelled,<END>
if,he,would,only,say,something,anything,<END>
she,felt,her,cheeks,getting,hot,<END>
i,have,got,to,have,the,money,soon,rhett,<END>
they'll,turn,us,out,in,the,road,and,that,damned,overseer,of,father's,will,own,the,place,and,<END>
just,a,minute,<END>
what,makes,you,think,i,still,want,you,<END>
what,makes,you,think,you,are,worth,three,hundred,dollars,<END>
most,women,don't,come,that,high,<END>
she,blushed,to,her,hair,line,and,her,humiliation,was,complete,<END>
why,are,you,doing,this,<END>
why,not,let,the,farm,go,and,live,at,miss,pittypat's,<END>
you,own,half,that,house,<END>
name,of,god,<END>
she,cried,<END>
are,you,a,fool,<END>
i,can't,let,tara,go,<END>
it's,home,<END>
i,won't,let,it,go,<END>
not,while,i've,got,breath,left,in,me,<END>
the,irish,said,he,lowering,his,chair,back,to,level,and,removing,his,hands,from,his,pockets,are,the,damnedest,race,<END>
they,put,so,much,emphasis,on,so,many,wrong,things,<END>
land,for,instance,<END>
and,every,bit,of,earth,is,just,like,every,other,bit,<END>
now,let,me,get,this,straight,scarlett,<END>
you,are,coming,to,me,with,a,business,proposition,<END>
i'll,give,you,three,hundred,dollars,and,you'll,become,my,mistress,<END>
yes,<END>
now,that,the,repulsive,word,had,been,said,she,felt,somehow,easier,and,hope,awoke,in,her,again,<END>
he,had,said,i'll,give,you,<END>
there,was,a,diabolic,gleam,in,his,eyes,as,if,something,amused,him,greatly,<END>
and,yet,when,i,had,the,effrontery,to,make,you,this,same,proposition,you,turned,me,out,of,the,house,<END>
and,also,you,called,me,a,number,of,very,hard,names,and,mentioned,in,passing,that,you,didn't,want,a,'passel,of,brats,',<END>
no,my,dear,i'm,not,rubbing,it,in,<END>
i'm,only,wondering,at,the,peculiarities,of,your,mind,<END>
you,wouldn't,do,it,for,your,own,pleasure,but,you,will,to,keep,the,wolf,away,from,the,door,<END>
it,proves,my,point,that,all,virtue,is,merely,a,matter,of,prices,<END>
oh,rhett,how,you,run,on,<END>
if,you,want,to,insult,me,go,on,and,do,it,but,give,me,the,money,<END>
she,was,breathing,easier,now,<END>
being,what,he,was,rhett,would,naturally,want,to,torment,and,insult,her,as,much,as,possible,to,pay,her,back,for,past,slights,and,for,her,recent,attempted,trickery,<END>
well,she,could,stand,it,<END>
she,could,stand,anything,<END>
tara,was,worth,it,all,<END>
for,a,brief,moment,it,was,mid-summer,and,the,afternoon,skies,were,blue,and,she,lay,drowsily,in,the,thick,clover,of,tara's,lawn,looking,up,at,the,billowing,cloud,castles,the,fragrance,of,white,blossoms,in,her,nose,and,the,pleasant,busy,humming,of,bees,in,her,ears,<END>
afternoon,and,hush,and,the,far-off,sound,of,the,wagons,coming,in,from,the,spiraling,red,fields,<END>
worth,it,all,worth,more,<END>
her,head,went,up,<END>
are,you,going,to,give,me,the,money,<END>
he,looked,as,if,he,were,enjoying,himself,and,when,he,spoke,there,was,suave,brutality,in,his,voice,<END>
no,i'm,not,he,said,<END>
for,a,moment,her,mind,could,not,adjust,itself,to,his,words,<END>
i,couldn't,give,it,to,you,even,if,i,wanted,to,<END>
i,haven't,a,cent,on,me,<END>
not,a,dollar,in,atlanta,<END>
i,have,some,money,yes,but,not,here,<END>
and,i'm,not,saying,where,it,is,or,how,much,<END>
but,if,i,tried,to,draw,a,draft,on,it,the,yankees,would,be,on,me,like,a,duck,on,a,june,bug,and,then,neither,of,us,would,get,it,<END>
what,do,you,think,of,that,<END>
her,face,went,an,ugly,green,freckles,suddenly,standing,out,across,her,nose,and,her,contorted,mouth,was,like,gerald's,in,a,killing,rage,<END>
she,sprang,to,her,feet,with,an,incoherent,cry,which,made,the,hum,of,voices,in,the,next,room,cease,suddenly,<END>
swift,as,a,panther,rhett,was,beside,her,his,heavy,hand,across,her,mouth,his,arm,tight,about,her,waist,<END>
she,struggled,against,him,madly,trying,to,bite,his,hand,to,kick,his,legs,to,scream,her,rage,despair,hate,her,agony,of,broken,pride,<END>
she,bent,and,twisted,every,way,against,the,iron,of,his,arm,her,heart,near,bursting,her,tight,stays,cutting,off,her,breath,<END>
he,held,her,so,tightly,so,roughly,that,it,hurt,and,the,hand,over,her,mouth,pinched,into,her,jaws,cruelly,<END>
his,face,was,white,under,its,tan,his,eyes,hard,and,anxious,as,he,lifted,her,completely,off,her,feet,swung,her,up,against,his,chest,and,sat,down,in,the,chair,holding,her,writhing,in,his,lap,<END>
darling,for,god's,sake,<END>
stop,<END>
hush,<END>
don't,yell,<END>
they'll,be,in,here,in,a,minute,if,you,do,<END>
do,calm,yourself,<END>
do,you,want,the,yankees,to,see,you,like,this,<END>
she,was,beyond,caring,who,saw,her,beyond,anything,except,a,fiery,desire,to,kill,him,but,dizziness,was,sweeping,her,<END>
she,could,not,breathe,he,was,choking,her,her,stays,were,like,a,swiftly,compressing,band,of,iron,his,arms,about,her,made,her,shake,with,helpless,hate,and,fury,<END>
then,his,voice,became,thin,and,dim,and,his,face,above,her,swirled,in,a,sickening,mist,which,became,heavier,and,heavier,until,she,no,longer,saw,him,or,anything,else,<END>
when,she,made,feeble,swimming,motions,to,come,back,to,consciousness,she,was,tired,to,her,bones,weak,bewildered,<END>
she,was,lying,back,in,the,chair,her,bonnet,off,rhett,was,slapping,her,wrist,his,black,eyes,searching,her,face,anxiously,<END>
the,nice,young,captain,was,trying,to,pour,a,glass,of,brandy,into,her,mouth,and,had,spilled,it,down,her,neck,<END>
the,other,officers,hovered,helplessly,about,whispering,and,waving,their,hands,<END>
i,guess,i,must,have,fainted,she,said,and,her,voice,sounded,so,far,away,it,frightened,her,<END>
drink,this,said,rhett,taking,the,glass,and,pushing,it,against,her,lips,<END>
now,she,remembered,and,glared,feebly,at,him,but,she,was,too,tired,for,anger,<END>
please,for,my,sake,<END>
she,gulped,and,choked,and,began,coughing,but,he,pushed,it,to,her,mouth,again,<END>
she,swallowed,deeply,and,the,hot,liquid,burned,suddenly,in,her,throat,<END>
i,think,she's,better,now,gentlemen,said,rhett,and,i,thank,you,very,much,<END>
the,realization,that,i'm,to,be,executed,was,too,much,for,her,<END>
the,group,in,blue,shuffled,their,feet,and,looked,embarrassed,and,after,several,clearings,of,throats,they,tramped,out,<END>
the,young,captain,paused,in,the,doorway,<END>
if,there's,anything,more,i,can,do,<END>
no,thank,you,<END>
he,went,out,closing,the,door,behind,him,<END>
drink,some,more,said,rhett,<END>
no,<END>
drink,it,<END>
she,swallowed,another,mouthful,and,the,warmth,began,spreading,through,her,body,and,strength,flowed,slowly,back,into,her,shaking,legs,<END>
she,pushed,away,the,glass,and,tried,to,rise,but,he,pressed,her,back,<END>
take,your,hands,off,me,<END>
i'm,going,<END>
not,yet,<END>
wait,a,minute,<END>
you,might,faint,again,<END>
i'd,rather,faint,in,the,road,than,be,here,with,you,<END>
just,the,same,i,won't,have,you,fainting,in,the,road,<END>
let,me,go,<END>
i,hate,you,<END>
a,faint,smile,came,back,to,his,face,at,her,words,<END>
that,sounds,more,like,you,<END>
you,must,be,feeling,better,<END>
she,lay,relaxed,for,a,moment,trying,to,summon,anger,to,her,aid,trying,to,draw,on,her,strength,<END>
but,she,was,too,tired,<END>
she,was,too,tired,to,hate,or,to,care,very,much,about,anything,<END>
defeat,lay,on,her,spirit,like,lead,<END>
she,had,gambled,everything,and,lost,everything,<END>
not,even,pride,was,left,<END>
this,was,the,dead,end,of,her,last,hope,<END>
this,was,the,end,of,tara,the,end,of,them,all,<END>
for,a,long,time,she,lay,back,with,her,eyes,closed,hearing,his,heavy,breathing,near,her,and,the,glow,of,the,brandy,crept,gradually,over,her,giving,a,false,strength,and,warmth,<END>
when,finally,she,opened,her,eyes,and,looked,him,in,the,face,anger,had,roused,again,<END>
as,her,slanting,eyebrows,rushed,down,together,in,a,frown,rhett's,old,smile,came,back,<END>
now,you,are,better,<END>
i,can,tell,it,by,your,scowl,<END>
of,course,i'm,all,right,<END>
rhett,butler,you,are,hateful,a,skunk,if,ever,i,saw,one,<END>
you,knew,very,well,what,i,was,going,to,say,as,soon,as,i,started,talking,and,you,knew,you,weren't,going,to,give,me,the,money,<END>
and,yet,you,let,me,go,right,on,<END>
you,could,have,spared,me,<END>
spared,you,and,missed,hearing,all,that,<END>
not,much,<END>

i,don't,know,when,i've,ever,heard,anything,so,gratifying,<END>
he,laughed,his,sudden,mocking,laugh,<END>
at,the,sound,she,leaped,to,her,feet,snatching,up,her,bonnet,<END>

she,did,not,even,notice,that,his,hands,were,jammed,in,his,pockets,in,hard,fists,as,if,he,were,straining,at,his,own,impotence,<END>
cheer,up,he,said,as,she,tied,the,bonnet,strings,<END>

a,horse,and,buggy,came,slowly,up,the,road,and,she,turned,to,watch,it,determined,to,beg,a,ride,if,the,driver,was,a,white,person,<END>

there,was,something,familiar,about,his,face,and,as,she,stepped,out,into,the,road,to,get,a,closer,view,there,was,an,embarrassed,little,cough,from,the,man,and,a,well-known,voice,cried,in,accents,of,pleasure,and,astonishment,surely,it,can't,be,miss,scarlett,<END>

he,colored,with,pleasure,at,the,obvious,sincerity,of,her,words,hastily,squirted,a,stream,of,tobacco,juice,from,the,opposite,side,of,the,buggy,and,leaped,spryly,to,the,ground,<END>
he,shook,her,hand,enthusiastically,and,holding,up,the,tarpaulin,assisted,her,into,the,buggy,<END>

it,was,nice,to,have,a,man,fussing,and,clucking,and,scolding,even,if,it,was,only,that,old,maid,in,pants,frank,kennedy,<END>
it,was,especially,soothing,after,rhett's,brutal,treatment,<END>

he,was,well,dressed,she,noticed,and,the,buggy,was,new,too,<END>
the,horse,looked,young,and,well,fed,but,frank,looked,far,older,than,his,years,older,than,on,that,christmas,eve,when,he,had,been,at,tara,with,his,men,<END>
he,was,thin,and,sallow,faced,and,his,yellow,eyes,were,watery,and,sunken,in,creases,of,loose,flesh,<END>

no,she,said,wrapping,the,warm,lap,robe,about,her,and,trying,to,pull,it,up,around,her,neck,<END>
i,came,alone,<END>

all,the,folks,at,tara,well,<END>
oh,yes,so-so,<END>
she,must,think,of,something,to,talk,about,yet,it,was,so,hard,to,talk,<END>
her,mind,was,leaden,with,defeat,and,all,she,wanted,was,to,lie,back,in,this,warm,blanket,and,say,to,herself,i,won't,think,of,tara,now,<END>
i'll,think,of,it,later,when,it,won't,hurt,so,much,<END>
if,she,could,just,get,him,started,talking,on,some,subject,which,would,hold,him,all,the,way,home,so,she,would,have,nothing,to,do,but,murmur,how,nice,and,you,certainly,are,smart,at,intervals,<END>
mr,kennedy,i'm,so,surprised,to,see,you,<END>
i,know,i've,been,a,bad,girl,not,keeping,up,with,old,friends,but,i,didn't,know,you,were,here,in,atlanta,<END>

i,do,business,in,marietta,a,lot,of,business,he,said,<END>
didn't,miss,suellen,tell,you,i,had,settled,in,atlanta,<END>
didn't,she,tell,you,about,my,store,<END>
vaguely,she,had,a,memory,of,suellen,chattering,about,frank,and,a,store,but,she,never,paid,much,heed,to,anything,suellen,said,<END>
it,had,been,sufficient,to,know,that,frank,was,alive,and,would,some,day,take,suellen,off,her,hands,<END>
no,not,a,word,she,lied,<END>
have,you,a,store,<END>
how,smart,you,must,be,<END>
he,looked,a,little,hurt,at,hearing,that,suellen,had,not,published,the,news,but,brightened,at,the,flattery,<END>
yes,i've,got,a,store,and,a,pretty,good,one,i,think,<END>
folks,tell,me,i'm,a,born,merchant,<END>
he,laughed,pleasedly,the,tittery,cackling,laugh,which,she,always,found,so,annoying,<END>
conceited,old,fool,she,thought,<END>
oh,you,could,be,a,success,at,anything,you,turned,your,hand,to,mr,kennedy,<END>
but,how,on,earth,did,you,ever,get,started,with,the,store,<END>
when,i,saw,you,christmas,before,last,you,said,you,didn't,have,a,cent,in,the,world,<END>
he,cleared,his,throat,raspingly,clawed,at,his,whiskers,and,smiled,his,nervous,timid,smile,<END>
well,it's,a,long,story,miss,scarlett,<END>
thank,the,lord,<END>
she,thought,<END>
perhaps,it,will,hold,him,till,we,get,home,<END>
and,aloud,do,tell,<END>
you,recall,when,we,came,to,tara,last,hunting,for,supplies,<END>
well,not,long,after,that,i,went,into,active,service,<END>
i,mean,real,fighting,<END>
no,more,commissary,for,me,<END>
there,wasn't,much,need,for,a,commissary,miss,scarlett,because,we,couldn't,hardly,pick,up,a,thing,for,the,army,and,i,thought,the,place,for,an,able-bodied,man,was,in,the,fighting,line,<END>
well,i,fought,along,with,the,cavalry,for,a,spell,till,i,got,a,minie,ball,through,the,shoulder,<END>
he,looked,very,proud,and,scarlett,said,how,dreadful,<END>
oh,it,wasn't,so,bad,just,a,flesh,wound,he,said,deprecatingly,<END>
i,was,sent,down,south,to,a,hospital,and,when,i,was,just,about,well,the,yankee,raiders,came,through,<END>
my,my,but,that,was,a,hot,time,<END>
we,didn't,have,much,warning,and,all,of,us,who,could,walk,helped,haul,out,the,army,stores,and,the,hospital,equipment,to,the,train,tracks,to,move,it,<END>
we'd,gotten,one,train,about,loaded,when,the,yankees,rode,in,one,end,of,town,and,out,we,went,the,other,end,as,fast,as,we,could,go,<END>
my,my,that,was,a,mighty,sad,sight,sitting,on,top,of,that,train,and,seeing,the,yankees,burn,those,supplies,we,had,to,leave,at,the,depot,<END>
miss,scarlett,they,burned,about,a,half-mile,of,stuff,we,had,piled,up,there,along,the,tracks,<END>
we,just,did,get,away,ourselves,<END>
how,dreadful,<END>
yes,that's,the,word,<END>
dreadful,<END>
our,men,had,come,back,into,atlanta,then,and,so,our,train,was,sent,here,<END>
well,miss,scarlett,it,wasn't,long,before,the,war,was,over,and,well,there,was,a,lot,of,china,and,cots,and,mattresses,and,blankets,and,nobody,claiming,them,<END>
i,suppose,rightfully,they,belonged,to,the,yankees,<END>
i,think,those,were,the,terms,of,the,surrender,weren't,they,<END>
um,said,scarlett,absently,<END>
she,was,getting,warmer,now,and,a,little,drowsy,<END>
i,don't,know,till,now,if,i,did,right,he,said,a,little,querulously,<END>
but,the,way,i,figured,it,all,that,stuff,wouldn't,do,the,yankees,a,bit,of,good,<END>
they'd,probably,burn,it,<END>
and,our,folks,had,paid,good,solid,money,for,it,and,i,thought,it,still,ought,to,belong,to,the,confederacy,or,to,the,confederates,<END>
do,you,see,what,i,mean,<END>
um,<END>
i'm,glad,you,agree,with,me,miss,scarlett,<END>
in,a,way,it's,been,on,my,conscience,<END>
lots,of,folks,have,told,me,'oh,forget,about,it,frank,',but,i,can't,<END>
i,couldn't,hold,up,my,head,if,i,thought,i'd,done,what,wasn't,right,<END>
do,you,think,i,did,right,<END>
of,course,she,said,wondering,what,the,old,fool,had,been,talking,about,<END>
some,struggle,with,his,conscience,<END>
when,a,man,got,as,old,as,frank,kennedy,he,ought,to,have,learned,not,to,bother,about,things,that,didn't,matter,<END>
but,he,always,was,so,nervous,and,fussy,and,old,maidish,<END>
i'm,glad,to,hear,you,say,it,<END>
after,the,surrender,i,had,about,ten,dollars,in,silver,and,nothing,else,in,the,world,<END>
you,know,what,they,did,to,jonesboro,and,my,house,and,store,there,<END>
i,just,didn't,know,what,to,do,<END>
but,i,used,the,ten,dollars,to,put,a,roof,on,an,old,store,down,by,five,points,and,i,moved,the,hospital,equipment,in,and,started,selling,it,<END>
everybody,needed,beds,and,china,and,mattresses,and,i,sold,them,cheap,because,i,figured,it,was,about,as,much,other,folks',stuff,as,it,was,mine,<END>
but,i,cleared,money,on,it,and,bought,some,more,stuff,and,the,store,just,went,along,fine,<END>
i,think,i'll,make,a,lot,of,money,on,it,if,things,pick,up,<END>
at,the,word,money,her,mind,came,back,to,him,crystal,clear,<END>
you,say,you've,made,money,<END>
he,visibly,expanded,under,her,interest,<END>
few,women,except,suellen,had,ever,given,him,more,than,perfunctory,courtesy,and,it,was,very,flattering,to,have,a,former,belle,like,scarlett,hanging,on,his,words,<END>
he,slowed,the,horse,so,they,would,not,reach,home,before,he,had,finished,his,story,<END>
i'm,not,a,millionaire,miss,scarlett,and,considering,the,money,i,used,to,have,what,i've,got,now,sounds,small,<END>
but,i,made,a,thousand,dollars,this,year,<END>
of,course,five,hundred,of,it,went,to,paying,for,new,stock,and,repairing,the,store,and,paying,the,rent,<END>
but,i've,made,five,hundred,clear,and,as,things,are,certainly,picking,up,i,ought,to,clear,two,thousand,next,year,<END>
i,can,sure,use,it,too,for,you,see,i've,got,another,iron,in,the,fire,<END>
interest,had,sprung,up,sharply,in,her,at,the,talk,of,money,<END>
she,veiled,her,eyes,with,thick,bristly,lashes,and,moved,a,little,closer,to,him,<END>
what,does,that,mean,mr,<END>
kennedy,<END>
he,laughed,and,slapped,the,reins,against,the,horse's,back,<END>
i,guess,i'm,boring,you,talking,about,business,miss,scarlett,<END>
a,pretty,little,woman,like,you,doesn't,need,to,know,anything,about,business,<END>
the,old,fool,<END>
oh,i,know,i'm,a,goose,about,business,but,i'm,so,interested,<END>
please,tell,me,all,about,it,and,you,can,explain,what,i,don't,understand,<END>
well,my,other,iron,is,a,sawmill,<END>
a,what,<END>
a,mill,to,cut,up,lumber,and,plane,it,<END>
i,haven't,bought,it,yet,but,i'm,going,to,<END>
there's,a,man,named,johnson,who,has,one,way,out,peachtree,road,and,he's,anxious,to,sell,it,<END>
he,needs,some,cash,right,away,so,he,wants,to,sell,and,stay,and,run,it,for,me,at,a,weekly,wage,<END>
it's,one,of,the,few,mills,in,this,section,miss,scarlett,<END>
the,yankees,destroyed,most,of,them,<END>
and,anyone,who,owns,a,sawmill,owns,a,gold,mine,for,nowadays,you,can,ask,your,own,price,for,lumber,<END>
the,yankees,burned,so,many,houses,here,and,there,aren't,enough,for,people,to,live,in,and,it,looks,like,folks,have,gone,crazy,about,rebuilding,<END>
they,can't,get,enough,lumber,and,they,can't,get,it,fast,enough,<END>
people,are,just,pouring,into,atlanta,now,all,the,folks,from,the,country,districts,who,can't,make,a,go,of,farming,without,darkies,and,the,yankees,and,carpetbaggers,who,are,swarming,in,trying,to,pick,our,bones,a,little,barer,than,they,already,are,<END>
i,tell,you,atlanta's,going,to,be,a,big,town,soon,<END>
they've,got,to,have,lumber,for,their,houses,so,i'm,going,to,buy,this,mill,just,as,soon,as,well,as,soon,as,some,of,the,bills,owing,me,are,paid,<END>
by,this,time,next,year,i,ought,to,be,breathing,easier,about,money,<END>
i,i,guess,you,know,why,i'm,so,anxious,to,make,money,quickly,don't,you,<END>
he,blushed,and,cackled,again,<END>
he's,thinking,of,suellen,scarlett,thought,in,disgust,<END>
for,a,moment,she,considered,asking,him,to,lend,her,three,hundred,dollars,but,wearily,she,rejected,the,idea,<END>
he,would,be,embarrassed,he,would,stammer,he,would,offer,excuses,but,he,wouldn't,lend,it,to,her,<END>
he,had,worked,hard,for,it,so,he,could,marry,suellen,in,the,spring,and,if,he,parted,with,it,his,wedding,would,be,postponed,indefinitely,<END>
even,if,she,worked,on,his,sympathies,and,his,duty,toward,his,future,family,and,gained,his,promise,of,a,loan,she,knew,suellen,would,never,permit,it,<END>
suellen,was,getting,more,and,more,worried,over,the,fact,that,she,was,practically,an,old,maid,and,she,would,move,heaven,and,earth,to,prevent,anything,from,delaying,her,marriage,<END>
what,was,there,in,that,whining,complaining,girl,to,make,this,old,fool,so,anxious,to,give,her,a,soft,nest,<END>
suellen,didn't,deserve,a,loving,husband,and,the,profits,of,a,store,and,a,sawmill,<END>
the,minute,sue,got,her,hands,on,a,little,money,she'd,give,herself,unendurable,airs,and,never,contribute,one,cent,toward,the,upkeep,of,tara,<END>
not,suellen,<END>
she'd,think,herself,well,out,of,it,and,not,care,if,tara,went,for,taxes,or,burned,to,the,ground,so,long,as,she,had,pretty,clothes,and,a,mrs,in,front,of,her,name,<END>
as,scarlett,thought,of,suellen's,secure,future,and,the,precarious,one,of,herself,and,tara,anger,flamed,in,her,at,the,unfairness,of,life,<END>
hastily,she,looked,out,of,the,buggy,into,the,muddy,street,lest,frank,should,see,her,expression,<END>
she,was,going,to,lose,everything,she,had,while,sue,suddenly,a,determination,was,born,in,her,<END>
suellen,should,not,have,frank,and,his,store,and,his,mill,<END>
suellen,didn't,deserve,them,<END>
she,was,going,to,have,them,herself,<END>
she,thought,of,tara,and,remembered,jonas,wilkerson,venomous,as,a,rattler,at,the,foot,of,the,front,steps,and,she,grasped,at,the,last,straw,floating,above,the,shipwreck,of,her,life,<END>
rhett,had,failed,her,but,the,lord,had,provided,frank,<END>

if,i,could,make,rhett,almost,propose,i,know,i,could,get,frank,<END>
her,eyes,went,over,him,her,lids,flickering,<END>
certainly,he's,no,beauty,she,thought,coolly,and,he's,got,very,bad,teeth,and,his,breath,smells,bad,and,he's,old,enough,to,be,my,father,<END>
moreover,he's,nervous,and,timid,and,well,meaning,and,i,don't,know,of,any,more,damning,qualities,a,man,can,have,<END>
but,at,least,he's,a,gentleman,and,i,believe,i,could,stand,living,with,him,better,than,with,rhett,<END>
certainly,i,could,manage,him,easier,<END>
at,any,rate,beggars,can't,be,choosers,<END>
that,he,was,suellen's,fiance,caused,her,no,qualm,of,conscience,<END>
after,the,complete,moral,collapse,which,had,sent,her,to,atlanta,and,to,rhett,the,appropriation,of,her,sister's,betrothed,seemed,a,minor,affair,and,one,not,to,be,bothered,with,at,this,time,<END>
with,the,rousing,of,fresh,hope,her,spine,stiffened,and,she,forgot,that,her,feet,were,wet,and,cold,<END>
she,looked,at,frank,so,steadily,her,eyes,narrowing,that,he,became,somewhat,alarmed,and,she,dropped,her,gaze,swiftly,remembering,rhett's,words,i've,seen,eyes,like,yours,above,a,dueling,pistol,<END>
they,evoke,no,ardor,in,the,male,breast,<END>

frank,clicked,his,tongue,again,and,suddenly,he,found,that,her,head,was,on,his,shoulder,<END>
he,did,not,quite,know,how,it,got,there,<END>
surely,he,had,not,placed,it,there,but,there,her,head,was,and,there,was,scarlett,helplessly,sobbing,against,his,thin,chest,an,exciting,and,novel,sensation,for,him,<END>
he,patted,her,shoulder,timidly,gingerly,at,first,and,when,she,did,not,rebuff,him,he,became,bolder,and,patted,her,firmly,<END>
what,a,helpless,sweet,womanly,little,thing,she,was,<END>
and,how,brave,and,silly,to,try,her,hand,at,making,money,by,her,needle,<END>

you,are,a,brave,little,woman,he,pronounced,but,i,won't,have,you,do,this,sort,of,thing,<END>
your,family,would,die,of,shame,<END>
then,what,will,i,do,<END>
the,swimming,eyes,looked,up,to,him,as,if,she,knew,he,knew,everything,and,was,hanging,on,his,words,<END>

you,are,so,smart,frank,<END>
she,had,never,called,him,by,his,first,name,before,and,the,sound,came,to,him,as,a,pleasant,shock,and,surprise,<END>
the,poor,girl,was,probably,so,upset,she,didn't,even,notice,her,slip,<END>
he,felt,very,kindly,toward,her,and,very,protecting,<END>
if,there,was,anything,he,could,do,for,suellen,o'hara's,sister,he,would,certainly,do,it,<END>
he,pulled,out,a,red,bandanna,handkerchief,and,handed,it,to,her,and,she,wiped,her,eyes,and,began,to,smile,tremulously,<END>

surely,the,saints,and,angels,watched,over,her,to,give,her,such,a,heaven-sent,opportunity,<END>
she,managed,to,look,very,startled,and,embarrassed,and,opened,her,mouth,as,if,to,speak,quickly,and,then,shut,it,with,a,pop,<END>
don't,tell,me,you,didn't,know,i,was,to,be,your,brother-in-law,this,spring,he,said,with,nervous,jocularity,<END>

that,night,at,mrs,elsing's,when,fanny,had,been,duly,married,and,old,levi,and,the,other,musicians,were,tuning,up,for,the,dance,scarlett,looked,about,her,with,gladness,<END>
it,was,so,exciting,to,be,actually,at,a,party,again,<END>
she,was,pleased,also,with,the,warm,reception,she,had,received,<END>
when,she,entered,the,house,on,frank's,arm,everyone,had,rushed,to,her,with,cries,of,pleasure,and,welcome,kissed,her,shaken,her,hand,told,her,they,had,missed,her,dreadfully,and,that,she,must,never,go,back,to,tara,<END>
the,men,seemed,gallantly,to,have,forgotten,she,had,tried,her,best,to,break,their,hearts,in,other,days,and,the,girls,that,she,had,done,everything,in,her,power,to,entice,their,beaux,away,from,them,<END>
even,mrs,merriwether,mrs,whiting,mrs,meade,and,the,other,dowagers,who,had,been,so,cool,to,her,during,the,last,days,of,the,war,forgot,her,flighty,conduct,and,their,disapproval,of,it,and,recalled,only,that,she,had,suffered,in,their,common,defeat,and,that,she,was,pitty's,niece,and,charles',widow,<END>
they,kissed,her,and,spoke,gently,with,tears,in,their,eyes,of,her,dear,mother's,passing,and,asked,at,length,about,her,father,and,her,sisters,<END>
everyone,asked,about,melanie,and,ashley,demanding,the,reason,why,they,too,had,not,come,back,to,atlanta,<END>
in,spite,of,her,pleasure,at,the,welcome,scarlett,felt,a,slight,uneasiness,which,she,tried,to,conceal,an,uneasiness,about,the,appearance,of,her,velvet,dress,<END>
it,was,still,damp,to,the,knees,and,still,spotted,about,the,hem,despite,the,frantic,efforts,of,mammy,and,cookie,with,a,steaming,kettle,a,clean,hair,brush,and,frantic,wavings,in,front,of,an,open,fire,<END>
scarlett,was,afraid,someone,would,notice,her,bedraggled,state,and,realize,that,this,was,her,only,nice,dress,<END>
she,was,a,little,cheered,by,the,fact,that,many,of,the,dresses,of,the,other,guests,looked,far,worse,than,hers,<END>
they,were,so,old,and,had,such,carefully,mended,and,pressed,looks,<END>
at,least,her,dress,was,whole,and,new,damp,though,it,was,in,fact,the,only,new,dress,at,the,gathering,with,the,exception,of,fanny's,white-satin,wedding,gown,<END>
remembering,what,aunt,pitty,had,told,her,about,the,elsing,finances,she,wondered,where,the,money,for,the,satin,dress,had,been,obtained,and,for,the,refreshments,and,decorations,and,musicians,too,<END>
it,must,have,cost,a,pretty,penny,<END>
borrowed,money,probably,or,else,the,whole,elsing,clan,had,contributed,to,give,fanny,this,expensive,wedding,<END>
such,a,wedding,in,these,hard,times,seemed,to,scarlett,an,extravagance,on,a,par,with,the,tombstones,of,the,tarleton,boys,and,she,felt,the,same,irritation,and,lack,of,sympathy,she,had,felt,as,she,stood,in,the,tarleton,burying,ground,<END>
the,days,when,money,could,be,thrown,away,carelessly,had,passed,<END>
why,did,these,people,persist,in,making,the,gestures,of,the,old,days,when,the,old,days,were,gone,<END>
but,she,shrugged,off,her,momentary,annoyance,<END>
it,wasn't,her,money,and,she,didn't,want,her,evening's,pleasure,spoiled,by,irritation,at,other,people's,foolishness,<END>
she,discovered,she,knew,the,groom,quite,well,for,he,was,tommy,wellburn,from,sparta,and,she,had,nursed,him,in,1863,when,he,had,a,wound,in,his,shoulder,<END>
he,had,been,a,handsome,young,six-footer,then,and,had,given,up,his,medical,studies,to,go,in,the,cavalry,<END>
now,he,looked,like,a,little,old,man,so,bent,was,he,by,the,wound,in,his,hip,<END>
he,walked,with,some,difficulty,and,as,aunt,pitty,had,remarked,spraddled,in,a,very,vulgar,way,<END>
but,he,seemed,totally,unaware,of,his,appearance,or,unconcerned,about,it,and,had,the,manner,of,one,who,asks,no,odds,from,any,man,<END>
he,had,given,up,all,hope,of,continuing,his,medical,studies,and,was,now,a,contractor,working,a,labor,crew,of,irishmen,who,were,building,the,new,hotel,<END>
scarlett,wondered,how,he,managed,so,onerous,a,job,in,his,condition,but,asked,no,questions,realizing,wryly,that,almost,anything,was,possible,when,necessity,drove,<END>
tommy,and,hugh,elsing,and,the,little,monkey-like,rene,picard,stood,talking,with,her,while,the,chairs,and,furniture,were,pushed,back,to,the,wall,in,preparation,for,the,dancing,<END>
hugh,had,not,changed,since,scarlett,last,saw,him,in,1862,he,was,still,the,thin,sensitive,boy,with,the,same,lock,of,pale,brown,hair,hanging,over,his,forehead,and,the,same,delicate,useless-looking,hands,she,remembered,so,well,<END>

he,still,had,the,gallic,twinkle,in,his,black,eyes,and,the,creole,zest,for,living,but,for,all,his,easy,laughter,there,was,something,hard,about,his,face,which,had,not,been,there,in,the,early,days,of,the,war,<END>

when,he,had,hurried,away,to,bring,her,a,glass,of,wine,and,a,paper,thin,slice,of,cake,scarlett,sat,down,in,the,alcove,at,the,end,of,the,drawing,room,and,carefully,arranged,her,skirts,so,that,the,worst,spots,would,not,show,<END>
the,humiliating,events,of,the,morning,with,rhett,were,pushed,from,her,mind,by,the,excitement,of,seeing,so,many,people,and,hearing,music,again,<END>

tonight,she,was,alive,to,her,finger,tips,every,sense,alert,with,hope,her,eyes,sparkling,<END>
she,looked,from,the,alcove,into,the,huge,drawing,room,and,watched,the,dancers,remembering,how,beautiful,this,room,had,been,when,first,she,came,to,atlanta,during,the,war,<END>
then,the,hardwood,floors,had,shone,like,glass,and,overhead,the,chandelier,with,its,hundreds,of,tiny,prisms,had,caught,and,reflected,every,ray,of,the,dozens,of,candles,it,bore,flinging,them,like,gleams,from,diamonds,flame,and,sapphire,about,the,room,<END>
the,old,portraits,on,the,walls,had,been,dignified,and,gracious,and,had,looked,down,upon,guests,with,an,air,of,mellowed,hospitality,<END>
the,rosewood,sofas,had,been,soft,and,inviting,and,one,of,them,the,largest,had,stood,in,the,place,of,honor,in,this,same,alcove,where,she,now,sat,<END>
it,had,been,scarlett's,favorite,seat,at,parties,<END>
from,this,point,stretched,the,pleasant,vista,of,drawing,room,and,dining,room,beyond,the,oval,mahogany,table,which,seated,twenty,and,the,twenty,slim-legged,chairs,demurely,against,the,walls,the,massive,sideboard,and,buffet,weighted,with,heavy,silver,with,seven-branched,candlesticks,goblets,cruets,decanters,and,shining,little,glasses,<END>
scarlett,had,sat,on,that,sofa,so,often,in,the,first,years,of,the,war,always,with,some,handsome,officer,beside,her,and,listened,to,violin,and,bull,fiddle,accordion,and,banjo,and,heard,the,exciting,swishing,noises,which,dancing,feet,made,on,the,waxed,and,polished,floor,<END>
now,the,chandelier,hung,dark,<END>
it,was,twisted,askew,and,most,of,the,prisms,were,broken,as,if,the,yankee,occupants,had,made,their,beauty,a,target,for,their,boots,<END>
now,an,oil,lamp,and,a,few,candles,lighted,the,room,and,the,roaring,fire,in,the,wide,hearth,gave,most,of,the,illumination,<END>
its,flickering,light,showed,how,irreparably,scarred,and,splintered,the,dull,old,floor,was,<END>
squares,on,the,faded,paper,on,the,wall,gave,evidence,that,once,the,portraits,had,hung,there,and,wide,cracks,in,the,plaster,recalled,the,day,during,the,siege,when,a,shell,had,exploded,on,the,house,and,torn,off,parts,of,the,roof,and,second,floor,<END>
the,heavy,old,mahogany,table,spread,with,cake,and,decanters,still,presided,in,the,empty-looking,dining,room,but,it,was,scratched,and,the,broken,legs,showed,signs,of,clumsy,repair,<END>
the,sideboard,the,silver,and,the,spindly,chairs,were,gone,<END>
the,dull-gold,damask,draperies,which,had,covered,the,arching,french,windows,at,the,back,of,the,room,were,missing,and,only,the,remnants,of,the,lace,curtains,remained,clean,but,obviously,mended,<END>
in,place,of,the,curved,sofa,she,had,liked,so,much,was,a,hard,bench,that,was,none,too,comfortable,<END>
she,sat,upon,it,with,as,good,grace,as,possible,wishing,her,skirts,were,in,such,condition,that,she,could,dance,<END>
it,would,be,so,good,to,dance,again,<END>
but,of,course,she,could,do,more,with,frank,in,this,sequestered,alcove,than,in,a,breathless,reel,and,she,could,listen,fascinated,to,his,talk,and,encourage,him,to,greater,flights,of,foolishness,<END>
but,the,music,certainly,was,inviting,<END>
her,slipper,patted,longingly,in,time,with,old,levi's,large,splayed,foot,as,he,twanged,a,strident,banjo,and,called,the,figures,of,the,reel,<END>
feet,swished,and,scraped,and,patted,as,the,twin,lines,danced,toward,each,other,retreated,whirled,and,made,arches,of,their,arms,<END>

after,the,dull,and,exhausting,months,at,tara,it,was,good,to,hear,music,again,and,the,sound,of,dancing,feet,good,to,see,familiar,friendly,faces,laughing,in,the,feeble,light,calling,old,jokes,and,catchwords,bantering,rallying,coquetting,<END>
it,was,like,coming,to,life,again,after,being,dead,<END>
it,almost,seemed,that,the,bright,days,of,five,years,ago,had,come,back,again,<END>
if,she,could,close,her,eyes,and,not,see,the,worn,made-over,dresses,and,the,patched,boots,and,mended,slippers,if,her,mind,did,not,call,up,the,faces,of,boys,missing,from,the,reel,she,might,almost,think,that,nothing,had,changed,<END>
but,as,she,looked,watching,the,old,men,grouped,about,the,decanter,in,the,dining,room,the,matrons,lining,the,walls,talking,behind,fanless,hands,and,the,swaying,skipping,young,dancers,it,came,to,her,suddenly,coldly,frighteningly,that,it,was,all,as,greatly,changed,as,if,these,familiar,figures,were,ghosts,<END>
they,looked,the,same,but,they,were,different,<END>
what,was,it,<END>
was,it,only,that,they,were,five,years,older,<END>
no,it,was,something,more,than,the,passing,of,time,<END>
something,had,gone,out,of,them,out,of,their,world,<END>
five,years,ago,a,feeling,of,security,had,wrapped,them,all,around,so,gently,they,were,not,even,aware,of,it,<END>
in,its,shelter,they,had,flowered,<END>
now,it,was,gone,and,with,it,had,gone,the,old,thrill,the,old,sense,of,something,delightful,and,exciting,just,around,the,corner,the,old,glamor,of,their,way,of,living,<END>
she,knew,she,had,changed,too,but,not,as,they,had,changed,and,it,puzzled,her,<END>
she,sat,and,watched,them,and,she,felt,herself,an,alien,among,them,as,alien,and,lonely,as,if,she,had,come,from,another,world,speaking,a,language,they,did,not,understand,and,she,not,understanding,theirs,<END>

with,him,and,with,people,of,his,kind,and,they,made,up,most,of,her,world,she,felt,outside,of,something,she,could,not,understand,<END>

an,ageless,dignity,a,timeless,gallantry,still,clung,about,them,and,would,cling,until,they,died,but,they,would,carry,undying,bitterness,to,their,graves,a,bitterness,too,deep,for,words,<END>

everything,in,their,old,world,had,changed,but,the,old,forms,<END>
the,old,usages,went,on,must,go,on,for,the,forms,were,all,that,were,left,to,them,<END>
they,were,holding,tightly,to,the,things,they,knew,best,and,loved,best,in,the,old,days,the,leisured,manners,the,courtesy,the,pleasant,casualness,in,human,contacts,and,most,of,all,the,protecting,attitude,of,the,men,toward,their,women,<END>
true,to,the,tradition,in,which,they,had,been,reared,the,men,were,courteous,and,tender,and,they,almost,succeeded,in,creating,an,atmosphere,of,sheltering,their,women,from,all,that,was,harsh,and,unfit,for,feminine,eyes,<END>

the,old,days,had,gone,but,these,people,would,go,their,ways,as,if,the,old,days,still,existed,charming,leisurely,determined,not,to,rush,and,scramble,for,pennies,as,the,yankees,did,determined,to,part,with,none,of,the,old,ways,<END>

perhaps,it,was,that,there,was,nothing,she,would,not,do,and,there,were,so,many,things,these,people,would,rather,die,than,do,<END>
perhaps,it,was,that,they,were,without,hope,but,still,smiling,at,life,bowing,gracefully,and,passing,it,by,<END>

she,could,not,ignore,life,<END>

of,the,sweetness,and,courage,and,unyielding,pride,of,her,friends,scarlett,saw,nothing,<END>

as,she,stared,at,the,dancers,flushed,from,the,reel,she,wondered,if,things,drove,them,as,she,was,driven,dead,lovers,maimed,husbands,children,who,were,hungry,acres,slipping,away,beloved,roofs,that,sheltered,strangers,<END>

why,indeed,should,they,even,try,to,do,it,<END>
they,were,beyond,her,comprehension,and,vaguely,irritating,<END>

she,couldn't,survey,the,wreck,of,the,world,with,an,air,of,casual,unconcern,<END>
she,was,as,hunted,as,a,fox,running,with,a,bursting,heart,trying,to,reach,a,burrow,before,the,hounds,caught,up,<END>

she,was,proud,of,the,cologne,for,no,other,woman,in,the,room,was,wearing,any,and,frank,had,noticed,it,<END>

as,it,was,he,didn't,know,enough,about,women,even,to,suspect,what,she,was,up,to,<END>

she,married,frank,kennedy,two,weeks,later,after,a,whirlwind,courtship,which,she,blushingly,told,him,left,her,too,breathless,to,oppose,his,ardor,any,longer,<END>
he,did,not,know,that,during,those,two,weeks,she,had,walked,the,floor,at,night,gritting,her,teeth,at,the,slowness,with,which,he,took,hints,and,encouragements,praying,that,no,untimely,letter,from,suellen,would,reach,him,and,ruin,her,plans,<END>

but,there,was,always,a,chance,always,a,chance,she,thought,in,the,long,night,hours,as,she,padded,back,and,forth,across,the,cold,floor,of,her,bedroom,with,ellen's,faded,shawl,clutched,about,her,nightdress,<END>
frank,did,not,know,she,had,received,a,laconic,letter,from,will,relating,that,jonas,wilkerson,had,paid,another,call,at,tara,and,finding,her,gone,to,atlanta,had,stormed,about,until,will,and,ashley,threw,him,bodily,off,the,place,<END>
will's,letter,hammered,into,her,mind,the,fact,she,knew,only,too,well,that,time,was,getting,shorter,and,shorter,before,the,extra,taxes,must,be,paid,<END>
a,fierce,desperation,drove,her,as,she,saw,the,days,slipping,by,and,she,wished,she,might,grasp,the,hourglass,in,her,hands,and,keep,the,sands,from,running,<END>
but,so,well,did,she,conceal,her,feelings,so,well,did,she,enact,her,role,frank,suspected,nothing,saw,no,more,than,what,lay,on,the,surface,the,pretty,and,helpless,young,widow,of,charles,hamilton,who,greeted,him,every,night,in,miss,pittypat's,parlor,and,listened,breathless,with,admiration,as,he,told,of,future,plans,for,his,store,and,how,much,money,he,expected,to,make,when,he,was,able,to,buy,the,sawmill,<END>
her,sweet,sympathy,and,her,bright-eyed,interest,in,every,word,he,uttered,were,balm,upon,the,wound,left,by,suellen's,supposed,defection,<END>
his,heart,was,sore,and,bewildered,at,suellen's,conduct,and,his,vanity,the,shy,touchy,vanity,of,a,middle-aged,bachelor,who,knows,himself,to,be,unattractive,to,women,was,deeply,wounded,<END>
he,could,not,write,suellen,upbraiding,her,for,her,faithlessness,he,shrank,from,the,very,idea,<END>

without,saying,a,disloyal,word,about,suellen,she,could,tell,him,she,understood,how,badly,her,sister,had,treated,him,and,what,good,treatment,he,merited,from,a,woman,who,really,appreciated,him,<END>
little,mrs,hamilton,was,such,a,pretty,pink-cheeked,person,alternating,between,melancholy,sighs,when,she,thought,of,her,sad,plight,and,laughter,as,gay,and,sweet,as,the,tinkling,of,tiny,silver,bells,when,he,made,small,jokes,to,cheer,her,<END>
her,green,gown,now,neatly,cleaned,by,mammy,showed,off,her,slender,figure,with,its,tiny,waist,to,perfection,and,how,bewitching,was,the,faint,fragrance,which,always,clung,about,her,handkerchief,and,her,hair,<END>
it,was,a,shame,that,such,a,fine,little,woman,should,be,alone,and,helpless,in,a,world,so,rough,that,she,didn't,even,understand,its,harshness,<END>
no,husband,nor,brother,nor,even,a,father,now,to,protect,her,<END>
frank,thought,the,world,too,rude,a,place,for,a,lone,woman,and,in,that,idea,scarlett,silently,and,heartily,concurred,<END>
he,came,to,call,every,night,for,the,atmosphere,of,pitty's,house,was,pleasant,and,soothing,<END>
mammy's,smile,at,the,front,door,was,the,smile,reserved,for,quality,folks,pitty,served,him,coffee,laced,with,brandy,and,fluttered,about,him,and,scarlett,hung,on,his,every,utterance,<END>
sometimes,in,the,afternoons,he,took,scarlett,riding,with,him,in,his,buggy,when,he,went,out,on,business,<END>
these,rides,were,merry,affairs,because,she,asked,so,many,foolish,questions,just,like,a,woman,he,told,himself,approvingly,<END>
he,couldn't,help,laughing,at,her,ignorance,about,business,matters,and,she,laughed,too,saying,well,of,course,you,can't,expect,a,silly,little,woman,like,me,to,understand,men's,affairs,<END>
she,made,him,feel,for,the,first,time,in,his,old-maidish,life,that,he,was,a,strong,upstanding,man,fashioned,by,god,in,a,nobler,mold,than,other,men,fashioned,to,protect,silly,helpless,women,<END>
when,at,last,they,stood,together,to,be,married,her,confiding,little,hand,in,his,and,her,downcast,lashes,throwing,thick,black,crescents,on,her,pink,cheeks,he,still,did,not,know,how,it,all,came,about,<END>
he,only,knew,he,had,done,something,romantic,and,exciting,for,the,first,time,in,his,life,<END>
he,frank,kennedy,had,swept,this,lovely,creature,off,her,feet,and,into,his,strong,arms,<END>

no,friend,or,relative,stood,up,with,them,at,their,marriage,<END>
the,witnesses,were,strangers,called,in,from,the,street,<END>
scarlett,had,insisted,on,that,and,he,had,given,in,though,reluctantly,for,he,would,have,liked,his,sister,and,his,brother-in-law,from,jonesboro,to,be,with,him,<END>
and,a,reception,with,toasts,drunk,to,the,bride,in,miss,pitty's,parlor,amid,happy,friends,would,have,been,a,joy,to,him,<END>

like,an,elopement,<END>
i,always,did,want,to,run,away,and,be,married,<END>
please,sweetheart,just,for,me,<END>
it,was,that,endearing,term,still,so,new,to,his,ears,and,the,bright,teardrops,which,edged,her,pale,green,eyes,as,she,looked,up,pleadingly,at,him,that,won,him,over,<END>
after,all,a,man,had,to,make,some,concessions,to,his,bride,especially,about,the,wedding,for,women,set,such,a,store,by,sentimental,things,<END>

frank,gave,her,the,three,hundred,dollars,bewildered,by,her,sweet,urgency,reluctant,at,first,because,it,meant,the,end,of,his,hope,of,buying,the,sawmill,immediately,<END>
but,he,could,not,see,her,family,evicted,and,his,disappointment,soon,faded,at,the,sight,of,her,radiant,happiness,disappeared,entirely,at,the,loving,way,she,took,on,over,his,generosity,<END>
frank,had,never,before,had,a,woman,take,on,over,him,and,he,came,to,feel,that,the,money,had,been,well,spent,after,all,<END>
scarlett,dispatched,mammy,to,tara,immediately,for,the,triple,purpose,of,giving,will,the,money,announcing,her,marriage,and,bringing,wade,to,atlanta,<END>
in,two,days,she,had,a,brief,note,from,will,which,she,carried,about,with,her,and,read,and,reread,with,mounting,joy,<END>
will,wrote,that,the,taxes,had,been,paid,and,jonas,wilkerson,acted,up,pretty,bad,at,the,news,but,had,made,no,other,threats,so,far,<END>
will,closed,by,wishing,her,happiness,a,laconic,formal,statement,which,he,qualified,in,no,way,<END>
she,knew,will,understood,what,she,had,done,and,why,she,had,done,it,and,neither,blamed,nor,praised,<END>
but,what,must,ashley,think,<END>
she,wondered,feverishly,<END>
what,must,he,think,of,me,now,after,what,i,said,to,him,so,short,a,while,ago,in,the,orchard,at,tara,<END>
she,also,had,a,letter,from,suellen,poorly,spelled,violent,abusive,tear,splotched,a,letter,so,full,of,venom,and,truthful,observations,upon,her,character,that,she,was,never,to,forget,it,nor,forgive,the,writer,<END>
but,even,suellen's,words,could,not,dim,her,happiness,that,tara,was,safe,at,least,from,immediate,danger,<END>
it,was,hard,to,realize,that,atlanta,and,not,tara,was,her,permanent,home,now,<END>
in,her,desperation,to,obtain,the,tax,money,no,thought,save,tara,and,the,fate,which,threatened,it,had,any,place,in,her,mind,<END>
even,at,the,moment,of,marriage,she,had,not,given,a,thought,to,the,fact,that,the,price,she,was,paying,for,the,safety,of,home,was,permanent,exile,from,it,<END>
now,that,the,deed,was,done,she,realized,this,with,a,wave,of,homesickness,hard,to,dispel,<END>
but,there,it,was,<END>
she,had,made,her,bargain,and,she,intended,to,stand,by,it,<END>
and,she,was,so,grateful,to,frank,for,saving,tara,she,felt,a,warm,affection,for,him,and,an,equally,warm,determination,that,he,should,never,regret,marrying,her,<END>
the,ladies,of,atlanta,knew,their,neighbors',business,only,slightly,less,completely,than,they,knew,their,own,and,were,far,more,interested,in,it,<END>
they,all,knew,that,for,years,frank,kennedy,had,had,an,understanding,with,suellen,o'hara,<END>
in,fact,he,had,said,sheepishly,that,he,expected,to,get,married,in,the,spring,<END>
so,the,tumult,of,gossip,surmise,and,deep,suspicion,which,followed,the,announcement,of,his,quiet,wedding,to,scarlett,was,not,surprising,<END>
mrs,merriwether,who,never,let,her,curiosity,go,long,unsatisfied,if,she,could,help,it,asked,him,point-blank,just,what,he,meant,by,marrying,one,sister,when,he,was,betrothed,to,the,other,<END>
she,reported,to,mrs,elsing,that,all,the,answer,she,got,for,her,pains,was,a,silly,look,<END>
not,even,mrs,merriwether,doughty,soul,that,she,was,dared,to,approach,scarlett,on,the,subject,<END>
scarlett,seemed,demure,and,sweet,enough,these,days,but,there,was,a,pleased,complacency,in,her,eyes,which,annoyed,people,and,she,carried,a,chip,on,her,shoulder,which,no,one,cared,to,disturb,<END>
she,knew,atlanta,was,talking,but,she,did,not,care,<END>
after,all,there,wasn't,anything,immoral,in,marrying,a,man,<END>
tara,was,safe,<END>
let,people,talk,<END>
she,had,too,many,other,matters,to,occupy,her,mind,<END>
the,most,important,was,how,to,make,frank,realize,in,a,tactful,manner,that,his,store,should,bring,in,more,money,<END>
after,the,fright,jonas,wilkerson,had,given,her,she,would,never,rest,easy,until,she,and,frank,had,some,money,ahead,<END>
and,even,if,no,emergency,developed,frank,would,need,to,make,more,money,if,she,was,going,to,save,enough,for,next,year's,taxes,<END>
moreover,what,frank,had,said,about,the,sawmill,stuck,in,her,mind,<END>
frank,could,make,lots,of,money,out,of,a,mill,<END>
anybody,could,with,lumber,selling,at,such,outrageous,prices,<END>
she,fretted,silently,because,frank's,money,had,not,been,enough,to,pay,the,taxes,on,tara,and,buy,the,mill,as,well,<END>
and,she,made,up,her,mind,that,he,had,to,make,more,money,on,the,store,somehow,and,do,it,quickly,so,he,could,buy,that,mill,before,some,one,else,snapped,it,up,<END>
she,could,see,it,was,a,bargain,<END>
if,she,were,a,man,she,would,have,that,mill,if,she,had,to,mortgage,the,store,to,raise,the,money,<END>
but,when,she,intimated,this,delicately,to,frank,the,day,after,they,married,he,smiled,and,told,her,not,to,bother,her,sweet,pretty,little,head,about,business,matters,<END>
it,had,come,as,a,surprise,to,him,that,she,even,knew,what,a,mortgage,was,and,at,first,he,was,amused,<END>
but,this,amusement,quickly,passed,and,a,sense,of,shock,took,its,place,in,the,early,days,of,their,marriage,<END>
once,incautiously,he,had,told,her,that,people,he,was,careful,not,to,mention,names,owed,him,money,but,could,not,pay,just,now,and,he,was,of,course,unwilling,to,press,old,friends,and,gentlefolk,<END>
frank,regretted,ever,mentioning,it,for,thereafter,she,had,questioned,him,about,it,again,and,again,<END>
she,had,the,most,charmingly,childlike,air,but,she,was,just,curious,she,said,to,know,who,owed,him,and,how,much,they,owed,<END>
frank,was,very,evasive,about,the,matter,<END>
he,coughed,nervously,and,waved,his,hands,and,repeated,his,annoying,remark,about,her,sweet,pretty,little,head,<END>
it,had,begun,to,dawn,on,him,that,this,same,sweet,pretty,little,head,was,a,good,head,for,figures,<END>
in,fact,a,much,better,one,than,his,own,and,the,knowledge,was,disquieting,<END>
he,was,thunderstruck,to,discover,that,she,could,swiftly,add,a,long,column,of,figures,in,her,head,when,he,needed,a,pencil,and,paper,for,more,than,three,figures,<END>
and,fractions,presented,no,difficulties,to,her,at,all,<END>
he,felt,there,was,something,unbecoming,about,a,woman,understanding,fractions,and,business,matters,and,he,believed,that,should,a,woman,be,so,unfortunate,as,to,have,such,unladylike,comprehension,she,should,pretend,not,to,<END>
now,he,disliked,talking,business,with,her,as,much,as,he,had,enjoyed,it,before,they,were,married,<END>
then,he,had,thought,it,all,beyond,her,mental,grasp,and,it,had,been,pleasant,to,explain,things,to,her,<END>
now,he,saw,that,she,understood,entirely,too,well,and,he,felt,the,usual,masculine,indignation,at,the,duplicity,of,women,<END>
added,to,it,was,the,usual,masculine,disillusionment,in,discovering,that,a,woman,has,a,brain,<END>
just,how,early,in,his,married,life,frank,learned,of,the,deception,scarlett,had,used,in,marrying,him,no,one,ever,knew,<END>
perhaps,the,truth,dawned,on,him,when,tony,fontaine,obviously,fancy,free,came,to,atlanta,on,business,<END>
perhaps,it,was,told,him,more,directly,in,letters,from,his,sister,in,jonesboro,who,was,astounded,at,his,marriage,<END>
certainly,he,never,learned,from,suellen,herself,<END>
she,never,wrote,him,and,naturally,he,could,not,write,her,and,explain,<END>
what,good,would,explanations,do,anyway,now,that,he,was,married,<END>
he,writhed,inwardly,at,the,thought,that,suellen,would,never,know,the,truth,and,would,always,think,he,had,senselessly,jilted,her,<END>
probably,everyone,else,was,thinking,this,too,and,criticizing,him,<END>
it,certainly,put,him,in,an,awkward,position,<END>
and,he,had,no,way,of,clearing,himself,for,a,man,couldn't,go,about,saying,he,had,lost,his,head,about,a,woman,and,a,gentleman,couldn't,advertise,the,fact,that,his,wife,had,entrapped,him,with,a,lie,<END>
scarlett,was,his,wife,and,a,wife,was,entitled,to,the,loyalty,of,her,husband,<END>
furthermore,he,could,not,bring,himself,to,believe,she,had,married,him,coldly,and,with,no,affection,for,him,at,all,<END>
his,masculine,vanity,would,not,permit,such,a,thought,to,stay,long,in,his,mind,<END>
it,was,more,pleasant,to,think,she,had,fallen,so,suddenly,in,love,with,him,she,had,been,willing,to,lie,to,get,him,<END>
but,it,was,all,very,puzzling,<END>
he,knew,he,was,no,great,catch,for,a,woman,half,his,age,and,pretty,and,smart,to,boot,but,frank,was,a,gentleman,and,he,kept,his,bewilderment,to,himself,<END>
scarlett,was,his,wife,and,he,could,not,insult,her,by,asking,awkward,questions,which,after,all,would,not,remedy,matters,<END>
not,that,frank,especially,wanted,to,remedy,matters,for,it,appeared,that,his,marriage,would,be,a,happy,one,<END>
scarlett,was,the,most,charming,and,exciting,of,women,and,he,thought,her,perfect,in,all,things,except,that,she,was,so,headstrong,<END>
frank,learned,early,in,his,marriage,that,so,long,as,she,had,her,own,way,life,could,be,very,pleasant,but,when,she,was,opposed,given,her,own,way,she,was,as,gay,as,a,child,laughed,a,good,deal,made,foolish,little,jokes,sat,on,his,knee,and,tweaked,his,beard,until,he,vowed,he,felt,twenty,years,younger,<END>
she,could,be,unexpectedly,sweet,and,thoughtful,having,his,slippers,toasting,at,the,fire,when,he,came,home,at,night,fussing,affectionately,about,his,wet,feet,and,interminable,head,colds,remembering,that,he,always,liked,the,gizzard,of,the,chicken,and,three,spoonfuls,of,sugar,in,his,coffee,<END>
yes,life,was,very,sweet,and,cozy,with,scarlett,as,long,as,she,had,her,own,way,<END>
when,the,marriage,was,two,weeks,old,frank,contracted,the,grippe,and,dr,meade,put,him,to,bed,<END>
in,the,first,year,of,the,war,frank,had,spent,two,months,in,the,hospital,with,pneumonia,and,he,had,lived,in,dread,of,another,attack,since,that,time,so,he,was,only,too,glad,to,lie,sweating,under,three,blankets,and,drink,the,hot,concoctions,mammy,and,aunt,pitty,brought,him,every,hour,<END>
the,illness,dragged,on,and,frank,worried,more,and,more,about,the,store,as,each,day,passed,<END>
the,place,was,in,charge,of,the,counter,boy,who,came,to,the,house,every,night,to,report,on,the,day's,transactions,but,frank,was,not,satisfied,<END>
he,fretted,until,scarlett,who,had,only,been,waiting,for,such,an,opportunity,laid,a,cool,hand,on,his,forehead,and,said,now,sweetheart,i,shall,be,vexed,if,you,take,on,so,<END>
i'll,go,to,town,and,see,how,things,are,<END>
and,she,went,smiling,as,she,smothered,his,feeble,protests,<END>
during,the,three,weeks,of,her,new,marriage,she,had,been,in,a,fever,to,see,his,account,books,and,find,out,just,how,money,matters,stood,<END>
what,luck,that,he,was,bedridden,<END>
the,store,stood,near,five,points,its,new,roof,glaring,against,the,smoked,bricks,of,the,old,walls,<END>
wooden,awnings,covered,the,sidewalk,to,the,edge,of,the,street,and,at,the,long,iron,bars,connecting,the,uprights,horses,and,mules,were,hitched,their,heads,bowed,against,the,cold,misty,rain,their,backs,covered,with,torn,blankets,and,quilts,<END>
the,inside,of,the,store,was,almost,like,bullard's,store,in,jonesboro,except,that,there,were,no,loungers,about,the,roaring,red-hot,stove,whittling,and,spitting,streams,of,tobacco,juice,at,the,sand,boxes,<END>
it,was,bigger,than,bullard's,store,and,much,darker,<END>
the,wooden,awnings,cut,off,most,of,the,winter,daylight,and,the,interior,was,dim,and,dingy,only,a,trickle,of,light,coming,in,through,the,small,fly-specked,windows,high,up,on,the,side,walls,<END>
the,floor,was,covered,with,muddy,sawdust,and,everywhere,was,dust,and,dirt,<END>
there,was,a,semblance,of,order,in,the,front,of,the,store,where,tall,shelves,rose,into,the,gloom,stacked,with,bright,bolts,of,cloth,china,cooking,utensils,and,notions,<END>
but,in,the,back,behind,the,partition,chaos,reigned,<END>
here,there,was,no,flooring,and,the,assorted,jumble,of,stock,was,piled,helter-skelter,on,the,hard-packed,earth,<END>
in,the,semi-,darkness,she,saw,boxes,and,bales,of,goods,plows,and,harness,and,saddles,and,cheap,pine,coffins,<END>
secondhand,furniture,ranging,from,cheap,gum,to,mahogany,and,rosewood,reared,up,in,the,gloom,and,the,rich,but,worn,brocade,and,horsehair,upholstery,gleamed,incongruously,in,the,dingy,surroundings,<END>
china,chambers,and,bowl,and,pitcher,sets,littered,the,floor,and,all,around,the,four,walls,were,deep,bins,so,dark,she,had,to,hold,the,lamp,directly,over,them,to,discover,they,contained,seeds,nails,bolts,and,carpenters',tools,<END>
i'd,think,a,man,as,fussy,and,old,maidish,as,frank,would,keep,things,tidier,she,thought,scrubbing,her,grimy,hands,with,her,handkerchief,<END>
this,place,is,a,pig,pen,<END>
what,a,way,to,run,a,store,<END>
if,he'd,only,dust,up,this,stuff,and,put,it,out,in,front,where,folks,could,see,it,he,could,sell,things,much,quicker,<END>
and,if,his,stock,was,in,such,condition,what,mustn't,his,accounts,be,<END>
i'll,look,at,his,account,book,now,she,thought,and,picking,up,the,lamp,she,went,into,the,front,of,the,store,<END>
willie,the,counter,boy,was,reluctant,to,give,her,the,large,dirty-backed,ledger,<END>
it,was,obvious,that,young,as,he,was,he,shared,frank's,opinion,that,women,had,no,place,in,business,<END>
but,scarlett,silenced,him,with,a,sharp,word,and,sent,him,out,to,get,his,dinner,<END>
she,felt,better,when,he,was,gone,for,his,disapproval,annoyed,her,and,she,settled,herself,in,a,split-bottomed,chair,by,the,roaring,stove,tucked,one,foot,under,her,and,spread,the,book,across,her,lap,<END>
it,was,dinner,time,and,the,streets,were,deserted,<END>
no,customers,called,and,she,had,the,store,to,herself,<END>
she,turned,the,pages,slowly,narrowly,scanning,the,rows,of,names,and,figures,written,in,frank's,cramped,copperplate,hand,<END>
it,was,just,as,she,had,expected,and,she,frowned,as,she,saw,this,newest,evidence,of,frank's,lack,of,business,sense,<END>
at,least,five,hundred,dollars,in,debts,some,of,them,months,old,were,set,down,against,the,names,of,people,she,knew,well,the,merriwethers,and,the,elsings,among,other,familiar,names,<END>
from,frank's,deprecatory,remarks,about,the,money,people,owed,him,she,had,imagined,the,sums,to,be,small,<END>
but,this,<END>
if,they,can't,pay,why,do,they,keep,on,buying,<END>
she,thought,irritably,<END>
and,if,he,knows,they,can't,pay,why,does,he,keep,on,selling,them,stuff,<END>
lots,of,them,could,pay,if,he'd,just,make,them,do,it,<END>
the,elsings,certainly,could,if,they,could,give,fanny,a,new,satin,dress,and,an,expensive,wedding,<END>
frank's,just,too,soft,hearted,and,people,take,advantage,of,him,<END>
why,if,he'd,collected,half,this,money,he,could,have,bought,the,sawmill,and,easily,spared,me,the,tax,money,too,<END>
then,she,thought,just,imagine,frank,trying,to,operate,a,sawmill,<END>
god's,nightgown,<END>
if,he,runs,this,store,like,a,charitable,institution,how,could,he,expect,to,make,money,on,a,mill,<END>
the,sheriff,would,have,it,in,a,month,<END>
why,i,could,run,this,store,better,than,he,does,<END>
and,i,could,run,a,mill,better,than,he,could,even,if,i,don't,know,anything,about,the,lumber,business,<END>
a,startling,thought,this,that,a,woman,could,handle,business,matters,as,well,as,or,better,than,a,man,a,revolutionary,thought,to,scarlett,who,had,been,reared,in,the,tradition,that,men,were,omniscient,and,women,none,too,bright,<END>
of,course,she,had,discovered,that,this,was,not,altogether,true,but,the,pleasant,fiction,still,stuck,in,her,mind,<END>
never,before,had,she,put,this,remarkable,idea,into,words,<END>
she,sat,quite,still,with,the,heavy,book,across,her,lap,her,mouth,a,little,open,with,surprise,thinking,that,during,the,lean,months,at,tara,she,had,done,a,man's,work,and,done,it,well,<END>
she,had,been,brought,up,to,believe,that,a,woman,alone,could,accomplish,nothing,yet,she,had,managed,the,plantation,without,men,to,help,her,until,will,came,<END>
why,why,her,mind,stuttered,i,believe,women,could,manage,everything,in,the,world,without,men's,help,except,having,babies,and,god,knows,no,woman,in,her,right,mind,would,have,babies,if,she,could,help,it,<END>
with,the,idea,that,she,was,as,capable,as,a,man,came,a,sudden,rush,of,pride,and,a,violent,longing,to,prove,it,to,make,money,for,herself,as,men,made,money,<END>
money,which,would,be,her,own,which,she,would,neither,have,to,ask,for,nor,account,for,to,any,man,<END>
i,wish,i,had,money,enough,to,buy,that,mill,myself,she,said,aloud,and,sighed,<END>
i'd,sure,make,it,hum,<END>
and,i,wouldn't,let,even,one,splinter,go,out,on,credit,<END>
she,sighed,again,<END>
there,was,nowhere,she,could,get,any,money,so,the,idea,was,out,of,the,question,<END>
frank,would,simply,have,to,collect,this,money,owing,him,and,buy,the,mill,<END>
it,was,a,sure,way,to,make,money,and,when,he,got,the,mill,she,would,certainly,find,some,way,to,make,him,be,more,businesslike,in,its,operation,than,he,had,been,with,the,store,<END>
she,pulled,a,back,page,out,of,the,ledger,and,began,copying,the,list,of,debtors,who,had,made,no,payments,in,several,months,<END>
she'd,take,the,matter,up,with,frank,just,as,soon,as,she,reached,home,<END>
she'd,make,him,realize,that,these,people,had,to,pay,their,bills,even,if,they,were,old,friends,even,if,it,did,embarrass,him,to,press,them,for,money,<END>
that,would,probably,upset,frank,for,he,was,timid,and,fond,of,the,approbation,of,his,friends,<END>
he,was,so,thin,skinned,he'd,rather,lose,the,money,than,be,businesslike,about,collecting,it,<END>
and,he'd,probably,tell,her,that,no,one,had,any,money,with,which,to,pay,him,<END>
well,perhaps,that,was,true,<END>
poverty,was,certainly,no,news,to,her,<END>
but,nearly,everybody,had,saved,some,silver,or,jewelry,or,was,hanging,on,to,a,little,real,estate,<END>
frank,could,take,them,in,lieu,of,cash,<END>
she,could,imagine,how,frank,would,moan,when,she,broached,such,an,idea,to,him,<END>
take,the,jewelry,and,property,of,his,friends,<END>
well,she,shrugged,he,can,moan,all,he,likes,<END>
i'm,going,to,tell,him,that,he,may,be,willing,to,stay,poor,for,friendship's,sake,but,i'm,not,<END>
frank,will,never,get,anywhere,if,he,doesn't,get,up,some,gumption,<END>
and,he's,got,to,get,somewhere,<END>
he's,got,to,make,money,even,if,i've,got,to,wear,the,pants,in,the,family,to,make,him,do,<END>
she,was,writing,busily,her,face,screwed,up,with,the,effort,her,tongue,clamped,between,her,teeth,when,the,front,door,opened,and,a,great,draft,of,cold,wind,swept,the,store,<END>
a,tall,man,came,into,the,dingy,room,walking,with,a,light,indian-like,tread,and,looking,up,she,saw,rhett,butler,<END>
he,was,resplendent,in,new,clothes,and,a,greatcoat,with,a,dashing,cape,thrown,back,from,his,heavy,shoulders,<END>
his,tall,hat,was,off,in,a,deep,bow,when,her,eyes,met,his,and,his,hand,went,to,the,bosom,of,a,spotless,pleated,shirt,<END>
his,white,teeth,gleamed,startlingly,against,his,brown,face,and,his,bold,eyes,raked,her,<END>
my,dear,mrs,kennedy,he,said,walking,toward,her,<END>
my,very,dear,mrs,<END>
kennedy,<END>
and,he,broke,into,a,loud,merry,laugh,<END>
at,first,she,was,as,startled,as,if,a,ghost,had,invaded,the,store,and,then,hastily,removing,her,foot,from,beneath,her,she,stiffened,her,spine,and,gave,him,a,cold,stare,<END>
what,are,you,doing,here,<END>
i,called,on,miss,pittypat,and,learned,of,your,marriage,and,so,i,hastened,here,to,congratulate,you,<END>
the,memory,of,her,humiliation,at,his,hands,made,her,go,crimson,with,shame,<END>
i,don't,see,how,you,have,the,gall,to,face,me,<END>
she,cried,<END>
on,the,contrary,<END>
how,have,you,the,gall,to,face,me,<END>
oh,you,are,the,most,<END>
shall,we,let,the,bugles,sing,truce,<END>
he,smiled,down,at,her,a,wide,flashing,smile,that,had,impudence,in,it,but,no,shame,for,his,own,actions,or,condemnation,for,hers,<END>
in,spite,of,herself,she,had,to,smile,too,but,it,was,a,wry,uncomfortable,smile,<END>
what,a,pity,they,didn't,hang,you,<END>
others,share,your,feeling,i,fear,<END>
come,scarlett,relax,<END>
you,look,like,you'd,swallowed,a,ramrod,and,it,isn't,becoming,<END>
surely,you've,had,time,to,recover,from,my,er,my,little,joke,<END>
joke,<END>
ha,<END>
i'll,never,get,over,it,<END>
oh,yes,you,will,<END>
you,are,just,putting,on,this,indignant,front,because,you,think,it's,proper,and,respectable,<END>
may,i,sit,down,<END>
no,<END>
he,sank,into,a,chair,beside,her,and,grinned,<END>
i,hear,you,couldn't,even,wait,two,weeks,for,me,he,said,and,gave,a,mock,sigh,<END>
how,fickle,is,woman,<END>
when,she,did,not,reply,he,continued,<END>
tell,me,scarlett,just,between,friends,between,very,old,and,very,intimate,friends,wouldn't,it,have,been,wiser,to,wait,until,i,got,out,of,jail,<END>
or,are,the,charms,of,wedlock,with,old,frank,kennedy,more,alluring,than,illicit,relations,with,me,<END>
as,always,when,his,mockery,aroused,wrath,within,her,wrath,fought,with,laughter,at,his,impudence,<END>
don't,be,absurd,<END>
and,would,you,mind,satisfying,my,curiosity,on,one,point,which,has,bothered,me,for,some,time,<END>
did,you,have,no,womanly,repugnance,no,delicate,shrinking,from,marrying,not,just,one,man,but,two,for,whom,you,had,no,love,or,even,affection,<END>
or,have,i,been,misinformed,about,the,delicacy,of,our,southern,womanhood,<END>
rhett,<END>
i,have,my,answer,<END>
i,always,felt,that,women,had,a,hardness,and,endurance,unknown,to,men,despite,the,pretty,idea,taught,me,in,childhood,that,women,are,frail,tender,sensitive,creatures,<END>
but,after,all,according,to,the,continental,code,of,etiquette,it's,very,bad,form,for,husband,and,wife,to,love,each,other,<END>
very,bad,taste,indeed,<END>
i,always,felt,that,the,europeans,had,the,right,idea,in,that,matter,<END>
marry,for,convenience,and,love,for,pleasure,<END>
a,sensible,system,don't,you,think,<END>
you,are,closer,to,the,old,country,than,i,thought,<END>
how,pleasant,it,would,be,to,shout,at,him,i,did,not,marry,for,convenience,<END>
but,unfortunately,rhett,had,her,there,and,any,protest,of,injured,innocence,would,only,bring,more,barbed,remarks,from,him,<END>
how,you,do,run,on,she,said,coolly,<END>
anxious,to,change,the,subject,she,asked,how,did,you,ever,get,out,of,jail,<END>
oh,that,<END>
he,answered,making,an,airy,gesture,<END>
not,much,trouble,<END>
they,let,me,out,this,morning,<END>
i,employed,a,delicate,system,of,blackmail,on,a,friend,in,washington,who,is,quite,high,in,the,councils,of,the,federal,government,<END>
a,splendid,fellow,one,of,the,staunch,union,patriots,from,whom,i,used,to,buy,muskets,and,hoop,skirts,for,the,confederacy,<END>
when,my,distressing,predicament,was,brought,to,his,attention,in,the,right,way,he,hastened,to,use,his,influence,and,so,i,was,released,<END>
influence,is,everything,and,guilt,or,innocence,merely,an,academic,question,<END>
i'll,take,oath,you,weren't,innocent,<END>
no,now,that,i,am,free,of,the,toils,i'll,frankly,admit,that,i'm,as,guilty,as,cain,<END>
i,did,kill,the,nigger,<END>
he,was,uppity,to,a,lady,and,what,else,could,a,southern,gentleman,do,<END>
and,while,i'm,confessing,i,must,admit,that,i,shot,a,yankee,cavalryman,after,some,words,in,a,barroom,<END>
i,was,not,charged,with,that,peccadillo,so,perhaps,some,other,poor,devil,has,been,hanged,for,it,long,since,<END>
he,was,so,blithe,about,his,murders,her,blood,chilled,<END>
words,of,moral,indignation,rose,to,her,lips,but,suddenly,she,remembered,the,yankee,who,lay,under,the,tangle,of,scuppernong,vines,at,tara,<END>
he,had,not,been,on,her,conscience,any,more,than,a,roach,upon,which,she,might,have,stepped,<END>
she,could,not,sit,in,judgment,on,rhett,when,she,was,as,guilty,as,he,<END>
and,as,i,seem,to,be,making,a,clean,breast,of,it,i,must,tell,you,in,strictest,confidence,that,means,don't,tell,miss,pittypat,<END>
that,i,did,have,the,money,safe,in,a,bank,in,liverpool,<END>
the,money,<END>
yes,the,money,the,yankees,were,so,curious,about,<END>
scarlett,it,wasn't,altogether,meanness,that,kept,me,from,giving,you,the,money,you,wanted,<END>
if,i'd,drawn,a,draft,they,could,have,traced,it,somehow,and,i,doubt,if,you'd,have,gotten,a,cent,<END>
my,only,hope,lay,in,doing,nothing,<END>
i,knew,the,money,was,pretty,safe,for,if,worst,came,to,worst,if,they,had,located,it,and,tried,to,take,it,away,from,me,i,would,have,named,every,yankee,patriot,who,sold,me,bullets,and,machinery,during,the,war,<END>
then,there,would,have,been,a,stink,for,some,of,them,are,high,up,in,washington,now,<END>
in,fact,it,was,my,threat,to,unbosom,my,conscience,about,them,that,got,me,out,of,jail,<END>
i,<END>
do,you,mean,you,you,actually,have,the,confederate,gold,<END>
not,all,of,it,<END>
good,heavens,no,<END>
there,must,be,fifty,or,more,ex-,blockaders,who,have,plenty,salted,away,in,nassau,and,england,and,canada,<END>
we,will,be,pretty,unpopular,with,the,confederates,who,weren't,as,slick,as,we,were,<END>
i,have,got,close,to,half,a,million,<END>
just,think,scarlett,a,half-million,dollars,if,you'd,only,restrained,your,fiery,nature,and,not,rushed,into,wedlock,again,<END>
a,half-million,dollars,<END>
she,felt,a,pang,of,almost,physical,sickness,at,the,thought,of,so,much,money,<END>
his,jeering,words,passed,over,her,head,and,she,did,not,even,hear,them,<END>
it,was,hard,to,believe,there,was,so,much,money,in,all,this,bitter,and,poverty-,stricken,world,<END>
so,much,money,so,very,much,money,and,someone,else,had,it,someone,who,took,it,lightly,and,didn't,need,it,<END>
and,she,had,only,a,sick,elderly,husband,and,this,dirty,piddling,little,store,between,her,and,a,hostile,world,<END>
it,wasn't,fair,that,a,reprobate,like,rhett,butler,should,have,so,much,and,she,who,carried,so,heavy,a,load,should,have,so,little,<END>
she,hated,him,sitting,there,in,his,dandified,attire,taunting,her,<END>
well,she,wouldn't,swell,his,conceit,by,complimenting,him,on,his,cleverness,<END>
she,longed,viciously,for,sharp,words,with,which,to,cut,him,<END>
i,suppose,you,think,it's,honest,to,keep,the,confederate,money,<END>
well,it,isn't,<END>
it's,plain,out,and,out,stealing,and,you,know,it,<END>
i,wouldn't,have,that,on,my,conscience,<END>
my,<END>
how,sour,the,grapes,are,today,<END>
he,exclaimed,screwing,up,his,face,<END>
and,just,whom,am,i,stealing,from,<END>
she,was,silent,trying,to,think,just,whom,indeed,<END>
after,all,he,had,only,done,what,frank,had,done,on,a,small,scale,<END>
half,the,money,is,honestly,mine,he,continued,honestly,made,with,the,aid,of,honest,union,patriots,who,were,willing,to,sell,out,the,union,behind,its,back,for,one-hundred-per-cent,profit,on,their,goods,<END>
part,i,made,out,of,my,little,investment,in,cotton,at,the,beginning,of,the,war,the,cotton,i,bought,cheap,and,sold,for,a,dollar,a,pound,when,the,british,mills,were,crying,for,it,<END>
part,i,got,from,food,speculation,<END>
why,should,i,let,the,yankees,have,the,fruits,of,my,labor,<END>
but,the,rest,did,belong,to,the,confederacy,<END>
it,came,from,confederate,cotton,which,i,managed,to,run,through,the,blockade,and,sell,in,liverpool,at,sky-high,prices,<END>
the,cotton,was,given,me,in,good,faith,to,buy,leather,and,rifles,and,machinery,with,<END>
and,it,was,taken,by,me,in,good,faith,to,buy,the,same,<END>
my,orders,were,to,leave,the,gold,in,english,banks,under,my,own,name,in,order,that,my,credit,would,be,good,<END>
you,remember,when,the,blockade,tightened,i,couldn't,get,a,boat,out,of,any,confederate,port,or,into,one,so,there,the,money,stayed,in,england,<END>
what,should,i,have,done,<END>
drawn,out,all,that,gold,from,english,banks,like,a,simpleton,and,tried,to,run,it,into,wilmington,<END>
and,let,the,yankees,capture,it,<END>
was,it,my,fault,that,the,blockade,got,too,tight,<END>
was,it,my,fault,that,our,cause,failed,<END>
the,money,belonged,to,the,confederacy,<END>
well,there,is,no,confederacy,now,though,you'd,never,know,it,to,hear,some,people,talk,<END>
whom,shall,i,give,the,money,to,<END>
the,yankee,government,<END>
i,should,so,hate,for,people,to,think,me,a,thief,<END>
he,removed,a,leather,case,from,his,pocket,extracted,a,long,cigar,and,smelled,it,approvingly,meanwhile,watching,her,with,pseudo,anxiety,as,if,he,hung,on,her,words,<END>
plague,take,him,she,thought,he's,always,one,jump,ahead,of,me,<END>
there,is,always,something,wrong,with,his,arguments,but,i,never,can,put,my,finger,on,just,what,it,is,<END>
you,might,she,said,with,dignity,distribute,it,to,those,who,are,in,need,<END>
the,confederacy,is,gone,but,there,are,plenty,of,confederates,and,their,families,who,are,starving,<END>
he,threw,back,his,bead,and,laughed,rudely,<END>
you,are,never,so,charming,or,so,absurd,as,when,you,are,airing,some,hypocrisy,like,that,he,cried,in,frank,enjoyment,<END>
always,tell,the,truth,scarlett,<END>
you,can't,lie,<END>
the,irish,are,the,poorest,liars,in,the,world,<END>
come,now,be,frank,<END>
you,never,gave,a,damn,about,the,late,lamented,confederacy,and,you,care,less,about,the,starving,confederates,<END>
you'd,scream,in,protest,if,i,even,suggested,giving,away,all,the,money,unless,i,started,off,by,giving,you,the,lion's,share,<END>
i,don't,want,your,money,she,began,trying,to,be,coldly,dignified,<END>
oh,don't,you,<END>
your,palm,is,itching,to,beat,the,band,this,minute,<END>
if,i,showed,you,a,quarter,you'd,leap,on,it,<END>
if,you,have,come,here,to,insult,me,and,laugh,at,my,poverty,i,will,wish,you,good,day,she,retorted,trying,to,rid,her,lap,of,the,heavy,ledger,so,she,might,rise,and,make,her,words,more,impressive,<END>
instantly,he,was,on,his,feet,bending,over,her,laughing,as,he,pushed,her,back,into,her,chair,<END>
when,will,you,ever,get,over,losing,your,temper,when,you,hear,the,truth,<END>
you,never,mind,speaking,the,truth,about,other,people,so,why,should,you,mind,hearing,it,about,yourself,<END>
i'm,not,insulting,you,<END>
i,think,acquisitiveness,is,a,very,fine,quality,<END>
she,was,not,sure,what,acquisitiveness,meant,but,as,he,praised,it,she,felt,slightly,mollified,<END>
i,didn't,come,to,gloat,over,your,poverty,but,to,wish,you,long,life,and,happiness,in,your,marriage,<END>
by,the,way,what,did,sister,sue,think,of,your,larceny,<END>
my,what,<END>
your,stealing,frank,from,under,her,nose,<END>
i,did,not,<END>
well,we,won't,quibble,about,the,word,<END>
what,did,she,say,<END>
she,said,nothing,said,scarlett,<END>
his,eyes,danced,as,they,gave,her,the,lie,<END>
how,unselfish,of,her,<END>
now,let's,hear,about,your,poverty,<END>
surely,i,have,the,right,to,know,after,your,little,trip,out,to,the,jail,not,long,ago,<END>
hasn't,frank,as,much,money,as,you,hoped,<END>
there,was,no,evading,his,impudence,<END>
either,she,would,have,to,put,up,with,it,or,ask,him,to,leave,<END>
and,now,she,did,not,want,him,to,leave,<END>
his,words,were,barbed,but,they,were,the,barbs,of,truth,<END>
he,knew,what,she,had,done,and,why,she,had,done,it,and,he,did,not,seem,to,think,the,less,of,her,for,it,<END>
and,though,his,questions,were,unpleasantly,blunt,they,seemed,actuated,by,a,friendly,interest,<END>
he,was,one,person,to,whom,she,could,tell,the,truth,<END>
that,would,be,a,relief,for,it,had,been,so,long,since,she,had,told,anyone,the,truth,about,herself,and,her,motives,<END>
whenever,she,spoke,her,mind,everyone,seemed,to,be,shocked,<END>
talking,to,rhett,was,comparable,only,to,one,thing,the,feeling,of,ease,and,comfort,afforded,by,a,pair,of,old,slippers,after,dancing,in,a,pair,too,tight,<END>
didn't,you,get,the,money,for,the,taxes,<END>
don't,tell,me,the,wolf,is,still,at,the,door,of,tara,<END>
there,was,a,different,tone,in,his,voice,<END>
she,looked,up,to,meet,his,dark,eyes,and,caught,an,expression,which,startled,and,puzzled,her,at,first,and,then,made,her,suddenly,smile,a,sweet,and,charming,smile,which,was,seldom,on,her,face,these,days,<END>
what,a,perverse,wretch,he,was,but,how,nice,he,could,be,at,times,<END>
she,knew,now,that,the,real,reason,for,his,call,was,not,to,tease,her,but,to,make,sure,she,had,gotten,the,money,for,which,she,had,been,so,desperate,<END>
she,knew,now,that,he,had,hurried,to,her,as,soon,as,he,was,released,without,the,slightest,appearance,of,hurry,to,lend,her,the,money,if,she,still,needed,it,<END>
and,yet,he,would,torment,and,insult,her,and,deny,that,such,was,his,intent,should,she,accuse,him,<END>
he,was,quite,beyond,all,comprehension,<END>
did,he,really,care,about,her,more,than,he,was,willing,to,admit,<END>
or,did,he,have,some,other,motive,<END>
probably,the,latter,she,thought,<END>
but,who,could,tell,<END>
he,did,such,strange,things,sometimes,<END>
no,she,said,the,wolf,isn't,at,the,door,any,longer,<END>
i,i,got,the,money,<END>
but,not,without,a,struggle,i'll,warrant,<END>
did,you,manage,to,restrain,yourself,until,you,got,the,wedding,ring,on,your,finger,<END>
she,tried,not,to,smile,at,his,accurate,summing,up,of,her,conduct,but,she,could,not,help,dimpling,<END>
he,seated,himself,again,sprawling,his,long,legs,comfortably,<END>
well,tell,me,about,your,poverty,<END>
did,frank,the,brute,mislead,you,about,his,prospects,<END>
he,should,be,soundly,thrashed,for,taking,advantage,of,a,helpless,female,<END>
come,scarlett,tell,me,everything,<END>
you,should,have,no,secrets,from,me,<END>
surely,i,know,the,worst,about,you,<END>
oh,rhett,you're,the,worst,well,i,don't,know,what,<END>
no,he,didn't,exactly,fool,me,but,suddenly,it,became,a,pleasure,to,unburden,herself,<END>
rhett,if,frank,would,just,collect,the,money,people,owe,him,i,wouldn't,be,worried,about,anything,<END>
but,rhett,fifty,people,owe,him,and,he,won't,press,them,<END>
he's,so,thin,skinned,<END>
he,says,a,gentleman,can't,do,that,to,another,gentleman,<END>
and,it,may,be,months,and,may,be,never,before,we,get,the,money,<END>
well,what,of,it,<END>
haven't,you,enough,to,eat,on,until,he,does,collect,<END>
yes,but,well,as,a,matter,of,fact,i,could,use,a,little,money,right,now,<END>
her,eyes,brightened,as,she,thought,of,the,mill,<END>
perhaps,<END>
what,for,<END>
more,taxes,<END>
is,that,any,of,your,business,<END>
yes,because,you,are,getting,ready,to,touch,me,for,a,loan,<END>
oh,i,know,all,the,approaches,<END>
and,i'll,lend,it,to,you,without,my,dear,mrs,kennedy,that,charming,collateral,you,offered,me,a,short,while,ago,<END>
unless,of,course,you,insist,<END>
you,are,the,coarsest,<END>
not,at,all,<END>
i,merely,wanted,to,set,your,mind,at,ease,<END>
i,knew,you'd,be,worried,about,that,point,<END>
not,much,worried,but,a,little,<END>
and,i'm,willing,to,lend,you,the,money,<END>
but,i,do,want,to,know,how,you,are,going,to,spend,it,<END>
i,have,that,right,i,believe,<END>
if,it's,to,buy,you,pretty,frocks,or,a,carriage,take,it,with,my,blessing,<END>
but,if,it's,to,buy,a,new,pair,of,breeches,for,ashley,wilkes,i,fear,i,must,decline,to,lend,it,<END>
she,was,hot,with,sudden,rage,and,she,stuttered,until,words,came,<END>
ashley,wilkes,has,never,taken,a,cent,from,me,<END>
i,couldn't,make,him,take,a,cent,if,he,were,starving,<END>
you,don't,understand,him,how,honorable,how,proud,he,is,<END>
of,course,you,can't,understand,him,being,what,you,are,<END>
don't,let's,begin,calling,names,<END>
i,could,call,you,a,few,that,would,match,any,you,could,think,of,for,me,<END>
you,forget,that,i,have,been,keeping,up,with,you,through,miss,pittypat,and,the,dear,soul,tells,all,she,knows,to,any,sympathetic,listener,<END>
i,know,that,ashley,has,been,at,tara,ever,since,he,came,home,from,rock,island,<END>
i,know,that,you,have,even,put,up,with,having,his,wife,around,which,must,have,been,a,strain,on,you,<END>
ashley,is,<END>
oh,yes,he,said,waving,his,hand,negligently,<END>
ashley,is,too,sublime,for,my,earthy,comprehension,<END>
but,please,don't,forget,i,was,an,interested,witness,to,your,tender,scene,with,him,at,twelve,oaks,and,something,tells,me,he,hasn't,changed,since,then,<END>
and,neither,have,you,<END>
he,didn't,cut,so,sublime,a,figure,that,day,if,i,remember,rightly,<END>
and,i,don't,think,the,figure,he,cuts,now,is,much,better,<END>
why,doesn't,he,take,his,family,and,get,out,and,find,work,<END>
and,stop,living,at,tara,<END>
of,course,it's,just,a,whim,of,mine,but,i,don't,intend,to,lend,you,a,cent,for,tara,to,help,support,him,<END>
among,men,there's,a,very,unpleasant,name,for,men,who,permit,women,to,support,them,<END>
how,dare,you,say,such,things,<END>
he's,been,working,like,a,field,hand,<END>
for,all,her,rage,her,heart,was,wrung,by,the,memory,of,ashley,splitting,fence,rails,<END>
and,worth,his,weight,in,gold,i,dare,say,<END>
what,a,hand,he,must,be,with,the,manure,and,<END>
he's,<END>
oh,yes,i,know,<END>
let's,grant,that,he,does,the,best,he,can,but,i,don't,imagine,he's,much,help,<END>
you'll,never,make,a,farm,hand,out,of,a,wilkes,or,anything,else,that's,useful,<END>
the,breed,is,purely,ornamental,<END>
now,quiet,your,ruffled,feathers,and,overlook,my,boorish,remarks,about,the,proud,and,honorable,ashley,<END>
strange,how,these,illusions,will,persist,even,in,women,as,hard,headed,as,you,are,<END>
how,much,money,do,you,want,and,what,do,you,want,it,for,<END>
when,she,did,not,answer,he,repeated,<END>
what,do,you,want,it,for,<END>
and,see,if,you,can,manage,to,tell,me,the,truth,<END>
it,will,do,as,well,as,a,lie,<END>
in,fact,better,for,if,you,lie,to,me,i'll,be,sure,to,find,it,out,and,think,how,embarrassing,that,would,be,<END>
always,remember,this,scarlett,i,can,stand,anything,from,you,but,a,lie,your,dislike,for,me,your,tempers,all,your,vixenish,ways,but,not,a,lie,<END>
now,what,do,you,want,it,for,<END>
raging,as,she,was,at,his,attack,on,ashley,she,would,have,given,anything,to,spit,on,him,and,throw,his,offer,of,money,proudly,into,his,mocking,face,<END>
for,a,moment,she,almost,did,but,the,cold,hand,of,common,sense,held,her,back,<END>
she,swallowed,her,anger,with,poor,grace,and,tried,to,assume,an,expression,of,pleasant,dignity,<END>
he,leaned,back,in,his,chair,stretching,his,legs,toward,the,stove,<END>
if,there's,one,thing,in,the,world,that,gives,me,more,amusement,than,anything,else,he,remarked,it's,the,sight,of,your,mental,struggles,when,a,matter,of,principle,is,laid,up,against,something,practical,like,money,<END>
of,course,i,know,the,practical,in,you,will,always,win,but,i,keep,hanging,around,to,see,if,your,better,nature,won't,triumph,some,day,<END>
and,when,that,day,comes,i,shall,pack,my,bag,and,leave,atlanta,forever,<END>
there,are,too,many,women,whose,better,natures,are,always,triumphing,<END>
well,let's,get,back,to,business,<END>
how,much,and,what,for,<END>
i,don't,know,quite,how,much,i'll,need,she,said,sulkily,<END>
but,i,want,to,buy,a,sawmill,and,i,think,i,can,get,it,cheap,<END>
and,i'll,need,two,wagons,and,two,mules,<END>
i,want,good,mules,too,<END>
and,a,horse,and,buggy,for,my,own,use,<END>
a,sawmill,<END>
yes,and,if,you'll,lend,me,the,money,i'll,give,you,a,half-,interest,in,it,<END>
whatever,would,i,do,with,a,sawmill,<END>
make,money,<END>
we,can,make,loads,of,money,<END>
or,i'll,pay,you,interest,on,the,loan,let's,see,what,is,good,interest,<END>
fifty,per,cent,is,considered,very,fine,<END>
fifty,oh,but,you,are,joking,<END>
stop,laughing,you,devil,<END>
i'm,serious,<END>
that's,why,i'm,laughing,<END>
i,wonder,if,anyone,but,me,realizes,what,goes,on,in,that,head,back,of,your,deceptively,sweet,face,<END>
well,who,cares,<END>
listen,rhett,and,see,if,this,doesn't,sound,like,good,business,to,you,<END>
frank,told,me,about,this,man,who,has,a,sawmill,a,little,one,out,peachtree,road,and,he,wants,to,sell,it,<END>
he's,got,to,have,cash,money,pretty,quick,and,he'll,sell,it,cheap,<END>
there,aren't,many,sawmills,around,here,now,and,the,way,people,are,rebuilding,why,we,could,sell,lumber,sky,high,<END>
the,man,will,stay,and,run,the,mill,for,a,wage,<END>
frank,told,me,about,it,<END>
frank,would,buy,the,mill,himself,if,he,had,the,money,<END>
i,guess,he,was,intending,buying,it,with,the,money,he,gave,me,for,the,taxes,<END>
poor,frank,<END>
what,is,he,going,to,say,when,you,tell,him,you've,bought,it,yourself,right,out,from,under,him,<END>
and,how,are,you,going,to,explain,my,lending,you,the,money,without,compromising,your,reputation,<END>
scarlett,had,given,no,thought,to,this,so,intent,was,she,upon,the,money,the,mill,would,bring,in,<END>
well,i,just,won't,tell,him,<END>
he'll,know,you,didn't,pick,it,off,a,bush,<END>
i'll,tell,him,why,yes,i'll,tell,him,i,sold,you,my,diamond,earbobs,<END>
and,i,will,give,them,to,you,too,<END>
that'll,be,my,collat,my,whatchucallit,<END>
i,wouldn't,take,your,earbobs,<END>
i,don't,want,them,<END>
i,don't,like,them,<END>
they,aren't,really,mine,anyway,<END>
whose,are,they,<END>
her,mind,went,swiftly,back,to,the,still,hot,noon,with,the,country,hush,deep,about,tara,and,the,dead,man,in,blue,sprawled,in,the,hall,<END>
they,were,left,with,me,by,someone,who's,dead,<END>
they're,mine,all,right,<END>
take,them,<END>
i,don't,want,them,<END>
i'd,rather,have,the,money,for,them,<END>
good,lord,<END>
he,cried,impatiently,<END>
don't,you,ever,think,of,anything,but,money,<END>
no,she,replied,frankly,turning,hard,green,eyes,upon,him,<END>
and,if,you'd,been,through,what,i,have,you,wouldn't,either,<END>
i've,found,out,that,money,is,the,most,important,thing,in,the,world,and,as,god,is,my,witness,i,don't,ever,intend,to,be,without,it,again,<END>
she,remembered,the,hot,sun,the,soft,red,earth,under,her,sick,head,the,niggery,smell,of,the,cabin,behind,the,ruins,of,twelve,oaks,remembered,the,refrain,her,heart,had,beaten,i'll,never,be,hungry,again,<END>
i'll,never,be,hungry,again,<END>
i'm,going,to,have,money,some,day,lots,of,it,so,i,can,have,anything,i,want,to,eat,<END>
and,then,there'll,never,be,any,hominy,or,dried,peas,on,my,table,<END>
and,i'm,going,to,have,pretty,clothes,and,all,of,them,are,going,to,be,silk,<END>
all,<END>
all,she,said,shortly,not,even,troubling,to,blush,at,his,implication,<END>
i'm,going,to,have,money,enough,so,the,yankees,can,never,take,tara,away,from,me,<END>
and,i'm,going,to,have,a,new,roof,for,tara,and,a,new,barn,and,fine,mules,for,plowing,and,more,cotton,than,you,ever,saw,<END>
and,wade,isn't,ever,going,to,know,what,it,means,to,do,without,the,things,he,needs,<END>
never,<END>
he's,going,to,have,everything,in,the,world,<END>
and,all,my,family,they,aren't,ever,going,to,be,hungry,again,<END>
i,mean,it,<END>
every,word,<END>
you,don't,understand,you're,such,a,selfish,hound,<END>
you've,never,had,the,carpetbaggers,trying,to,drive,you,out,<END>
you've,never,been,cold,and,ragged,and,had,to,break,your,back,to,keep,from,starving,<END>
he,said,quietly,i,was,in,the,confederate,army,for,eight,months,<END>
i,don't,know,any,better,place,for,starving,<END>
the,army,<END>
bah,<END>
you've,never,had,to,pick,cotton,and,weed,corn,<END>
you've,don't,you,laugh,at,me,<END>
his,hands,were,on,hers,again,as,her,voice,rose,harshly,<END>
i,wasn't,laughing,at,you,<END>
i,was,laughing,at,the,difference,in,what,you,look,and,what,you,really,are,<END>
and,i,was,remembering,the,first,time,i,ever,saw,you,at,the,barbecue,at,the,wilkes',<END>
you,had,on,a,green,dress,and,little,green,slippers,and,you,were,knee,deep,in,men,and,quite,full,of,yourself,<END>
i'll,wager,you,didn't,know,then,how,many,pennies,were,in,a,dollar,<END>
there,was,only,one,idea,in,your,whole,mind,then,and,that,was,ensnaring,ash,<END>
she,jerked,her,hands,away,from,him,<END>
rhett,if,we,are,to,get,on,at,all,you'll,have,to,stop,talking,about,ashley,wilkes,<END>
we'll,always,fall,out,about,him,because,you,can't,understand,him,<END>
i,suppose,you,understand,him,like,a,book,said,rhett,maliciously,<END>
no,scarlett,if,i,am,to,lend,you,the,money,i,reserve,the,right,to,discuss,ashley,wilkes,in,any,terms,i,care,to,<END>
i,waive,the,right,to,collect,interest,on,my,loan,but,not,that,right,<END>
and,there,are,a,number,of,things,about,that,young,man,i'd,like,to,know,<END>
i,do,not,have,to,discuss,him,with,you,she,answered,shortly,<END>
oh,but,you,do,<END>
i,hold,the,purse,strings,you,see,<END>
some,day,when,you,are,rich,you,can,have,the,power,to,do,the,same,to,others,<END>
it's,obvious,that,you,still,care,about,him,<END>
i,do,not,<END>
oh,it's,so,obvious,from,the,way,you,rush,to,his,defense,<END>
you,<END>
i,won't,stand,having,my,friends,sneered,at,<END>
well,we'll,let,that,pass,for,the,moment,<END>
does,he,still,care,for,you,or,did,rock,island,make,him,forget,<END>
or,perhaps,he's,learned,to,appreciate,what,a,jewel,of,a,wife,he,has,<END>
at,the,mention,of,melanie,scarlett,began,to,breathe,hard,and,could,scarcely,restrain,herself,from,crying,out,the,whole,story,that,only,honor,kept,ashley,with,melanie,<END>
she,opened,her,mouth,to,speak,and,then,closed,it,<END>
oh,<END>
so,he,still,hasn't,enough,sense,to,appreciate,mrs,wilkes,<END>
and,the,rigors,of,prison,didn't,dim,his,ardor,for,you,<END>
i,see,no,need,to,discuss,the,subject,<END>
i,wish,to,discuss,it,said,rhett,<END>
there,was,a,low,note,in,his,voice,which,scarlett,did,not,understand,but,did,not,like,to,hear,<END>
and,by,god,i,will,discuss,it,and,i,expect,you,to,answer,me,<END>
so,he's,still,in,love,with,you,<END>
well,what,if,he,is,<END>
cried,scarlett,goaded,<END>
i,don't,care,to,discuss,him,with,you,because,you,can't,understand,him,or,his,kind,of,love,<END>
the,only,kind,of,love,you,know,about,is,just,well,the,kind,you,carry,on,with,creatures,like,that,watling,woman,<END>
oh,said,rhett,softly,<END>
so,i,am,only,capable,of,carnal,lusts,<END>
well,you,know,it's,true,<END>
now,i,appreciate,your,hesitance,in,discussing,the,matter,with,me,<END>
my,unclean,hands,and,lips,besmirch,the,purity,of,his,love,<END>
well,yes,something,like,that,<END>
i'm,interested,in,this,pure,love,<END>
don't,be,so,nasty,rhett,butler,<END>
if,you,are,vile,enough,to,think,there's,ever,been,anything,wrong,between,us,<END>
oh,the,thought,never,entered,my,head,really,<END>
that's,why,it,all,interests,me,<END>
just,why,hasn't,there,been,anything,wrong,between,you,<END>
if,you,think,that,ashley,would,<END>
ah,so,it's,ashley,and,not,you,who,has,fought,the,fight,for,purity,<END>
really,scarlett,you,should,not,give,yourself,away,so,easily,<END>
scarlett,looked,into,his,smooth,unreadable,face,in,confusion,and,indignation,<END>
we,won't,go,any,further,with,this,and,i,don't,want,your,money,<END>
so,get,out,<END>
oh,yes,you,do,want,my,money,and,as,we've,gone,this,far,why,stop,<END>
surely,there,can,be,no,harm,in,discussing,so,chaste,an,idyl,when,there,hasn't,been,anything,wrong,<END>
so,ashley,loves,you,for,your,mind,your,soul,your,nobility,of,character,<END>
scarlett,writhed,at,his,words,<END>
of,course,ashley,loved,her,for,just,these,things,<END>
it,was,this,knowledge,that,made,life,endurable,this,knowledge,that,ashley,bound,by,honor,loved,her,from,afar,for,beautiful,things,deep,buried,in,her,that,he,alone,could,see,<END>
but,they,did,not,seem,so,beautiful,when,dragged,to,the,light,by,rhett,especially,in,that,deceptively,smooth,voice,that,covered,sarcasm,<END>
it,gives,me,back,my,boyish,ideals,to,know,that,such,a,love,can,exist,in,this,naughty,world,he,continued,<END>
so,there's,no,touch,of,the,flesh,in,his,love,for,you,<END>
it,would,be,the,same,if,you,were,ugly,and,didn't,have,that,white,skin,<END>
and,if,you,didn't,have,those,green,eyes,which,make,a,man,wonder,just,what,you,would,do,if,he,took,you,in,his,arms,<END>
and,a,way,of,swaying,your,hips,that's,an,allurement,to,any,man,under,ninety,<END>
and,those,lips,which,are,well,i,mustn't,let,my,carnal,lusts,obtrude,<END>
ashley,sees,none,of,these,things,<END>
or,if,he,sees,them,they,move,him,not,at,all,<END>
unbidden,scarlett's,mind,went,back,to,that,day,in,the,orchard,when,ashley's,arms,shook,as,he,held,her,when,his,mouth,was,hot,on,hers,as,if,he,would,never,let,her,go,<END>
she,went,crimson,at,the,memory,and,her,blush,was,not,lost,on,rhett,<END>
so,he,said,and,there,was,a,vibrant,note,almost,like,anger,in,his,voice,<END>
i,see,<END>
he,loves,you,for,your,mind,alone,<END>
how,dare,he,pry,with,dirty,fingers,making,the,one,beautiful,sacred,thing,in,her,life,seem,vile,<END>
coolly,determinedly,he,was,breaking,down,the,last,of,her,reserves,and,the,information,he,wanted,was,forthcoming,<END>
yes,he,does,<END>
she,cried,pushing,back,the,memory,of,ashley's,lips,<END>
my,dear,he,doesn't,even,know,you've,got,a,mind,<END>
if,it,was,your,mind,that,attracted,him,he,would,not,need,to,struggle,against,you,as,he,must,have,done,to,keep,this,love,so,shall,we,say,'holy',<END>
he,could,rest,easily,for,after,all,a,man,can,admire,a,woman's,mind,and,soul,and,still,be,an,honorable,gentleman,and,true,to,his,wife,<END>
but,it,must,be,difficult,for,him,to,reconcile,the,honor,of,the,wilkeses,with,coveting,your,body,as,he,does,<END>
you,judge,everybody's,mind,by,your,own,vile,one,<END>
oh,i've,never,denied,coveting,you,if,that's,what,you,mean,<END>
but,thank,god,i'm,not,bothered,about,matters,of,honor,<END>
what,i,want,i,take,if,i,can,get,it,and,so,i,wrestle,neither,with,angels,nor,devils,<END>
what,a,merry,hell,you,must,have,made,for,ashley,<END>
almost,i,can,be,sorry,for,him,<END>
i,i,make,a,hell,for,him,<END>
yes,you,<END>
there,you,are,a,constant,temptation,to,him,but,like,most,of,his,breed,he,prefers,what,passes,in,these,parts,as,honor,to,any,amount,of,love,<END>
and,it,looks,to,me,as,if,the,poor,devil,now,had,neither,love,nor,honor,to,warm,himself,<END>
he,has,love,<END>
i,mean,he,loves,me,<END>
does,he,<END>
then,answer,me,this,and,we,are,through,for,the,day,and,you,can,take,the,money,and,throw,it,in,the,gutter,for,all,i,care,<END>
rhett,rose,to,his,feet,and,threw,his,half-smoked,cigar,into,the,spittoon,<END>
there,was,about,his,movements,the,same,pagan,freedom,and,leashed,power,scarlett,had,noted,that,night,atlanta,fell,something,sinister,and,a,little,frightening,<END>
if,he,loved,you,then,why,in,hell,did,he,permit,you,to,come,to,atlanta,to,get,the,tax,money,<END>
before,i'd,let,a,woman,i,loved,do,that,i'd,<END>
he,didn't,know,<END>
he,had,no,idea,that,i,<END>
doesn't,it,occur,to,you,that,he,should,have,known,<END>
there,was,barely,suppressed,savagery,in,his,voice,<END>
loving,you,as,you,say,he,does,he,should,have,known,just,what,you,would,do,when,you,were,desperate,<END>
he,should,have,killed,you,rather,than,let,you,come,up,here,and,to,me,of,all,people,<END>
god,in,heaven,<END>
but,he,didn't,know,<END>
if,he,didn't,guess,it,without,being,told,he'll,never,know,anything,about,you,and,your,precious,mind,<END>
how,unfair,he,was,<END>
as,if,ashley,was,a,mind,reader,<END>
as,if,ashley,could,have,stopped,her,even,had,he,known,<END>
but,she,knew,suddenly,ashley,could,have,stopped,her,<END>
the,faintest,intimation,from,him,in,the,orchard,that,some,day,things,might,be,different,and,she,would,never,have,thought,of,going,to,rhett,<END>
a,word,of,tenderness,even,a,parting,caress,when,she,was,getting,on,the,train,would,have,held,her,back,<END>
but,he,had,only,talked,of,honor,<END>

should,ashley,have,known,her,mind,<END>
swiftly,she,put,the,disloyal,thought,from,her,<END>
of,course,he,didn't,suspect,<END>
ashley,would,never,suspect,that,she,would,even,think,of,doing,anything,so,immoral,<END>
ashley,was,too,fine,to,have,such,thoughts,<END>
rhett,was,just,trying,to,spoil,her,love,<END>
he,was,trying,to,tear,down,what,was,most,precious,to,her,<END>
some,day,she,thought,viciously,when,the,store,was,on,its,feet,and,the,mill,doing,nicely,and,she,had,money,she,would,make,rhett,butler,pay,for,the,misery,and,humiliation,he,was,causing,her,<END>
he,was,standing,over,her,looking,down,at,her,faintly,amused,<END>
the,emotion,which,had,stirred,him,was,gone,<END>
what,does,it,all,matter,to,you,anyway,<END>
she,asked,<END>
it's,my,business,and,ashley's,and,not,yours,<END>
he,shrugged,<END>
only,this,<END>
i,have,a,deep,and,impersonal,admiration,for,your,endurance,scarlett,and,i,do,not,like,to,see,your,spirit,crushed,beneath,too,many,millstones,<END>
there's,tara,<END>
that's,a,man-sized,job,in,itself,<END>
there's,your,sick,father,added,on,<END>
he'll,never,be,any,help,to,you,<END>
and,the,girls,and,the,darkies,<END>
and,now,you've,taken,on,a,husband,and,probably,miss,pittypat,too,<END>
you've,enough,burdens,without,ashley,wilkes,and,his,family,on,your,hands,<END>
he's,not,on,my,hands,<END>
he,helps,<END>
oh,for,god's,sake,he,said,impatiently,<END>
don't,let's,have,any,more,of,that,<END>
he's,no,help,<END>
he's,on,your,hands,and,he'll,be,on,them,or,on,somebody's,till,he,dies,<END>
personally,i'm,sick,of,him,as,a,topic,of,conversation,<END>
how,much,money,do,you,want,<END>
vituperative,words,rushed,to,her,lips,<END>
after,all,his,insults,after,dragging,from,her,those,things,which,were,most,precious,to,her,and,trampling,on,them,he,still,thought,she,would,take,his,money,<END>
but,the,words,were,checked,unspoken,<END>
how,wonderful,it,would,be,to,scorn,his,offer,and,order,him,out,of,the,store,<END>
but,only,the,truly,rich,and,the,truly,secure,could,afford,this,luxury,<END>
so,long,as,she,was,poor,just,so,long,would,she,have,to,endure,such,scenes,as,this,<END>

i,shall,tell,them,all,to,go,to,halifax,she,thought,and,rhett,butler,will,be,the,first,one,<END>
the,pleasure,in,the,thought,brought,a,sparkle,into,her,green,eyes,and,a,half-smile,to,her,lips,<END>
rhett,smiled,too,<END>
you're,a,pretty,person,scarlett,he,said,<END>
especially,when,you,are,meditating,devilment,<END>
and,just,for,the,sight,of,that,dimple,i'll,buy,you,a,baker's,dozen,of,mules,if,you,want,them,<END>
the,front,door,opened,and,the,counter,boy,entered,picking,his,teeth,with,a,quill,<END>
scarlett,rose,pulled,her,shawl,about,her,and,tied,her,bonnet,strings,firmly,under,her,chin,<END>
her,mind,was,made,up,<END>
are,you,busy,this,afternoon,<END>
can,you,come,with,me,now,<END>
she,asked,<END>
where,<END>
i,want,you,to,drive,to,the,mill,with,me,<END>
i,promised,frank,i,wouldn't,drive,out,of,town,by,myself,<END>
to,the,mill,in,this,rain,<END>
yes,i,want,to,buy,that,mill,now,before,you,change,your,mind,<END>
he,laughed,so,loudly,the,boy,behind,the,counter,started,and,looked,at,him,curiously,<END>
have,you,forgotten,you,are,married,<END>
mrs,kennedy,can't,afford,to,be,seen,driving,out,into,the,country,with,that,butler,reprobate,who,isn't,received,in,the,best,parlors,<END>
have,you,forgotten,your,reputation,<END>
reputation,fiddle-dee-dee,<END>
i,want,that,mill,before,you,change,your,mind,or,frank,finds,out,that,i'm,buying,it,<END>
don't,be,a,slow,poke,rhett,<END>
what's,a,little,rain,<END>
let's,hurry,<END>
that,sawmill,<END>
frank,groaned,every,time,he,thought,of,it,cursing,himself,for,ever,mentioning,it,to,her,<END>
it,was,bad,enough,for,her,to,sell,her,earrings,to,captain,butler,of,all,people,<END>
and,buy,the,mill,without,even,consulting,her,own,husband,about,it,but,it,was,worse,still,that,she,did,not,turn,it,over,to,him,to,operate,<END>
that,looked,bad,<END>
as,if,she,did,not,trust,him,or,his,judgment,<END>
frank,in,common,with,all,men,he,knew,felt,that,a,wife,should,be,guided,by,her,husband's,superior,knowledge,should,accept,his,opinions,in,full,and,have,none,of,her,own,<END>
he,would,have,given,most,women,their,own,way,<END>
women,were,such,funny,little,creatures,and,it,never,hurt,to,humor,their,small,whims,<END>
mild,and,gentle,by,nature,it,was,not,in,him,to,deny,a,wife,much,<END>
he,would,have,enjoyed,gratifying,the,foolish,notions,of,some,soft,little,person,and,scolding,her,lovingly,for,her,stupidity,and,extravagance,<END>
but,the,things,scarlett,set,her,mind,on,were,unthinkable,<END>
that,sawmill,for,example,<END>
it,was,the,shock,of,his,life,when,she,told,him,with,a,sweet,smile,in,answer,to,his,questions,that,she,intended,to,run,it,herself,<END>
go,into,the,lumber,business,myself,was,the,way,she,put,it,<END>
frank,would,never,forget,the,horror,of,that,moment,<END>
go,into,business,for,herself,<END>
it,was,unthinkable,<END>
there,were,no,women,in,business,in,atlanta,<END>
in,fact,frank,had,never,heard,of,a,woman,in,business,anywhere,<END>
if,women,were,so,unfortunate,as,to,be,compelled,to,make,a,little,money,to,assist,their,families,in,these,hard,times,they,made,it,in,quiet,womanly,ways,baking,as,mrs,merriwether,was,doing,or,painting,china,and,sewing,and,keeping,boarders,like,mrs,elsing,and,fanny,or,teaching,school,like,mrs,meade,or,giving,music,lessons,like,mrs,bonnell,<END>
these,ladies,made,money,but,they,kept,themselves,at,home,while,they,did,it,as,a,woman,should,<END>
but,for,a,woman,to,leave,the,protection,of,her,home,and,venture,out,into,the,rough,world,of,men,competing,with,them,in,business,rubbing,shoulders,with,them,being,exposed,to,insult,and,gossip,<END>
especially,when,she,wasn't,forced,to,do,it,when,she,had,a,husband,amply,able,to,provide,for,her,<END>
frank,had,hoped,she,was,only,teasing,or,playing,a,joke,on,him,a,joke,of,questionable,taste,but,he,soon,found,she,meant,what,she,said,<END>
she,did,operate,the,sawmill,<END>
she,rose,earlier,than,he,did,to,drive,out,peachtree,road,and,frequently,did,not,come,home,until,long,after,he,had,locked,up,the,store,and,returned,to,aunt,pitty's,for,supper,<END>
she,drove,the,long,miles,to,the,mill,with,only,the,disapproving,uncle,peter,to,protect,her,and,the,woods,were,full,of,free,niggers,and,yankee,riffraff,<END>
frank,couldn't,go,with,her,the,store,took,all,of,his,time,but,when,he,protested,she,said,shortly,if,i,don't,keep,an,eye,on,that,slick,scamp,johnson,he'll,steal,my,lumber,and,sell,it,and,put,the,money,in,his,pocket,<END>
when,i,can,get,a,good,man,to,run,the,mill,for,me,then,i,won't,have,to,go,out,there,so,often,<END>
then,i,can,spend,my,time,in,town,selling,lumber,<END>
selling,lumber,in,town,<END>
that,was,worst,of,all,<END>
she,frequently,did,take,a,day,off,from,the,mill,and,peddle,lumber,and,on,those,days,frank,wished,he,could,hide,in,the,dark,back,room,of,his,store,and,see,no,one,<END>
his,wife,selling,lumber,<END>
and,people,were,talking,terrible,about,her,<END>
probably,about,him,too,for,permitting,her,to,behave,in,so,unwomanly,a,fashion,<END>
it,embarrassed,him,to,face,his,customers,over,the,counter,and,hear,them,say,i,saw,mrs,kennedy,a,few,minutes,ago,over,at,<END>
everyone,took,pains,to,tell,him,what,she,did,<END>
everyone,was,talking,about,what,happened,over,where,the,new,hotel,was,being,built,<END>
scarlett,had,driven,up,just,as,tommy,wellburn,was,buying,some,lumber,from,another,man,and,she,climbed,down,out,of,the,buggy,among,the,rough,irish,masons,who,were,laying,the,foundations,and,told,tommy,briefly,that,he,was,being,cheated,<END>
she,said,her,lumber,was,better,and,cheaper,too,and,to,prove,it,she,ran,up,a,long,column,of,figures,in,her,head,and,gave,him,an,estimate,then,and,there,<END>
it,was,bad,enough,that,she,had,intruded,herself,among,strange,rough,workmen,but,it,was,still,worse,for,a,woman,to,show,publicly,that,she,could,do,mathematics,like,that,<END>
when,tommy,accepted,her,estimate,and,gave,her,the,order,scarlett,had,not,taken,her,departure,speedily,and,meekly,but,had,idled,about,talking,to,johnnie,gallegher,the,foreman,of,the,irish,workers,a,hard-bitten,little,gnome,of,a,man,who,had,a,very,bad,reputation,<END>
the,town,talked,about,it,for,weeks,<END>
on,top,of,everything,else,she,was,actually,making,money,out,of,the,mill,and,no,man,could,feel,right,about,a,wife,who,succeeded,in,so,unwomanly,an,activity,<END>
nor,did,she,turn,over,the,money,or,any,part,of,it,to,him,to,use,in,the,store,<END>
most,of,it,went,to,tara,and,she,wrote,interminable,letters,to,will,benteen,telling,him,just,how,it,should,be,spent,<END>
furthermore,she,told,frank,that,if,the,repairs,at,tara,could,ever,be,completed,she,intended,to,lend,out,her,money,on,mortgages,<END>
my,<END>
my,<END>
moaned,frank,whenever,he,thought,of,this,<END>
a,woman,had,no,business,even,knowing,what,a,mortgage,was,<END>
scarlett,was,full,of,plans,these,days,and,each,one,of,them,seemed,worse,to,frank,than,the,previous,one,<END>
she,even,talked,of,building,a,saloon,on,the,property,where,her,warehouse,had,been,until,sherman,burned,it,<END>
frank,was,no,teetotaler,but,he,feverishly,protested,against,the,idea,<END>
owning,saloon,property,was,a,bad,business,an,unlucky,business,almost,as,bad,as,renting,to,a,house,of,prostitution,<END>
just,why,it,was,bad,he,could,not,explain,to,her,and,to,his,lame,arguments,she,said,fiddle-dee-dee,<END>
saloons,are,always,good,tenants,<END>
uncle,henry,said,so,she,told,him,<END>
they,always,pay,their,rent,and,look,here,frank,i,could,put,up,a,cheap,salon,out,of,poor-grade,lumber,i,can't,sell,and,get,good,rent,for,it,and,with,the,rent,money,and,the,money,from,the,mill,and,what,i,could,get,from,mortgages,i,could,buy,some,more,sawmills,<END>
sugar,you,don't,need,any,more,sawmills,<END>
cried,frank,appalled,<END>
what,you,ought,to,do,is,sell,the,one,you've,got,<END>
it's,wearing,you,out,and,you,know,what,trouble,you,have,keeping,free,darkies,at,work,there,<END>
free,darkies,are,certainly,worthless,scarlett,agreed,completely,ignoring,his,hint,that,she,should,sell,<END>
mr,johnson,says,he,never,knows,when,he,comes,to,work,in,the,morning,whether,he'll,have,a,full,crew,or,not,<END>
you,just,can't,depend,on,the,darkies,any,more,<END>
they,work,a,day,or,two,and,then,lay,off,till,they've,spent,their,wages,and,the,whole,crew,is,like,as,not,to,quit,overnight,<END>
the,more,i,see,of,emancipation,the,more,criminal,i,think,it,is,<END>
it's,just,ruined,the,darkies,<END>
thousands,of,them,aren't,working,at,all,and,the,ones,we,can,get,to,work,at,the,mill,are,so,lazy,and,shiftless,they,aren't,worth,having,<END>
and,if,you,so,much,as,swear,at,them,much,less,hit,them,a,few,licks,for,the,good,of,their,souls,the,freedmen's,bureau,is,down,on,you,like,a,duck,on,a,june,bug,<END>
sugar,you,aren't,letting,mr,johnson,beat,those,<END>
of,course,not,she,returned,impatiently,<END>
didn't,i,just,say,the,yankees,would,put,me,in,jail,if,i,did,<END>
i'll,bet,your,pa,never,hit,a,darky,a,lick,in,his,life,said,frank,<END>
well,only,one,<END>
a,stable,boy,who,didn't,rub,down,his,horse,after,a,day's,hunt,<END>
but,frank,it,was,different,then,<END>
free,issue,niggers,are,something,else,and,a,good,whipping,would,do,some,of,them,a,lot,of,good,<END>
frank,was,not,only,amazed,at,his,wife's,views,and,her,plans,but,at,the,change,which,had,come,over,her,in,the,few,months,since,their,marriage,<END>
this,wasn't,the,soft,sweet,feminine,person,he,had,taken,to,wife,<END>
in,the,brief,period,of,the,courtship,he,thought,he,had,never,known,a,woman,more,attractively,feminine,in,her,reactions,to,life,ignorant,timid,and,helpless,<END>
now,her,reactions,were,all,masculine,<END>
despite,her,pink,cheeks,and,dimples,and,pretty,smiles,she,talked,and,acted,like,a,man,<END>
her,voice,was,brisk,and,decisive,and,she,made,up,her,mind,instantly,and,with,no,girlish,shilly-,shallying,<END>
she,knew,what,she,wanted,and,she,went,after,it,by,the,shortest,route,like,a,man,not,by,the,hidden,and,circuitous,routes,peculiar,to,women,<END>
it,was,not,that,frank,had,never,seen,commanding,women,before,this,<END>
atlanta,like,all,southern,towns,had,its,share,of,dowagers,whom,no,one,cared,to,cross,<END>
no,one,could,be,more,dominating,than,stout,mrs,merriwether,more,imperious,than,frail,mrs,elsing,more,artful,in,securing,her,own,ends,than,the,silver-haired,sweet-voiced,mrs,whiting,<END>
but,no,matter,what,devices,these,ladies,employed,in,order,to,get,their,own,way,they,were,always,feminine,devices,<END>
they,made,a,point,of,being,deferential,to,men's,opinions,whether,they,were,guided,by,them,or,not,<END>
they,had,the,politeness,to,appear,to,be,guided,by,what,men,said,and,that,was,what,mattered,<END>
but,scarlett,was,guided,by,no,one,but,herself,and,was,conducting,her,affairs,in,a,masculine,way,which,had,the,whole,town,talking,about,her,<END>
and,thought,frank,miserably,probably,talking,about,me,too,for,letting,her,act,so,unwomanly,<END>
then,there,was,that,butler,man,<END>
his,frequent,calls,at,aunt,pitty's,house,were,the,greatest,humiliation,of,all,<END>
frank,had,always,disliked,him,even,when,he,had,done,business,with,him,before,the,war,<END>
he,often,cursed,the,day,he,had,brought,rhett,to,twelve,oaks,and,introduced,him,to,his,friends,<END>
he,despised,him,for,the,cold-blooded,way,he,had,acted,in,his,speculations,during,the,war,and,for,the,fact,that,he,had,not,been,in,the,army,<END>
rhett's,eight,months',service,with,the,confederacy,was,known,only,to,scarlett,for,rhett,had,begged,her,with,mock,fear,not,to,reveal,his,shame,to,anyone,<END>
most,of,all,frank,had,contempt,for,him,for,holding,on,to,the,confederate,gold,when,honest,men,like,admiral,bulloch,and,others,confronted,with,the,same,situation,had,turned,back,thousands,to,the,federal,treasury,<END>
but,whether,frank,liked,it,or,not,rhett,was,a,frequent,caller,<END>
ostensibly,it,was,miss,pitty,he,came,to,see,and,she,had,no,better,sense,than,to,believe,it,and,give,herself,airs,over,his,visits,<END>
but,frank,had,an,uncomfortable,feeling,that,miss,pitty,was,not,the,attraction,which,brought,him,<END>
little,wade,was,very,fond,of,him,though,the,boy,was,shy,of,most,people,and,even,called,him,uncle,rhett,which,annoyed,frank,<END>
and,frank,could,not,help,remembering,that,rhett,had,squired,scarlett,about,during,the,war,days,and,there,had,been,talk,about,them,then,<END>
he,imagined,there,might,be,even,worse,talk,about,them,now,<END>
none,of,his,friends,had,the,courage,to,mention,anything,of,this,sort,to,frank,for,all,their,outspoken,words,on,scarlett's,conduct,in,the,matter,of,the,mill,<END>
but,he,could,not,help,noticing,that,he,and,scarlett,were,less,frequently,invited,to,meals,and,parties,and,fewer,and,fewer,people,came,to,call,on,them,<END>
scarlett,disliked,most,of,her,neighbors,and,was,too,busy,with,her,mill,to,care,about,seeing,the,ones,she,did,like,so,the,lack,of,calls,did,not,disturb,her,<END>
but,frank,felt,it,keenly,<END>
all,of,his,life,frank,had,been,under,the,domination,of,the,phrase,what,will,the,neighbors,say,<END>
and,he,was,defenseless,against,the,shocks,of,his,wife's,repeated,disregard,of,the,proprieties,<END>
he,felt,that,everyone,disapproved,of,scarlett,and,was,contemptuous,of,him,for,permitting,her,to,unsex,herself,<END>
she,did,so,many,things,a,husband,should,not,permit,according,to,his,views,but,if,he,ordered,her,to,stop,them,argued,or,even,criticized,a,storm,broke,on,his,head,<END>
my,<END>
my,<END>
he,thought,helplessly,<END>
she,can,get,mad,quicker,and,stay,mad,longer,than,any,woman,i,ever,saw,<END>
even,at,the,times,when,things,were,most,pleasant,it,was,amazing,how,completely,and,how,quickly,the,teasing,affectionate,wife,who,hummed,to,herself,as,she,went,about,the,house,could,be,transformed,into,an,entirely,different,person,<END>
he,had,only,to,say,sugar,if,i,were,you,i,wouldn't,and,the,tempest,would,break,<END>
her,black,brows,rushed,together,to,meet,in,a,sharp,angle,over,her,nose,and,frank,cowered,almost,visibly,<END>
she,had,the,temper,of,a,tartar,and,the,rages,of,a,wild,cat,and,at,such,times,she,did,not,seem,to,care,what,she,said,or,how,much,it,hurt,<END>
clouds,of,gloom,hung,over,the,house,on,such,occasions,<END>
frank,went,early,to,the,store,and,stayed,late,<END>
pitty,scrambled,into,her,bedroom,like,a,rabbit,panting,for,its,burrow,<END>
wade,and,uncle,peter,retired,to,the,carriage,house,and,cookie,kept,to,her,kitchen,and,forebore,to,raise,her,voice,to,praise,the,lord,in,song,<END>
only,mammy,endured,scarlett's,temper,with,equanimity,and,mammy,had,had,many,years,of,training,with,gerald,o'hara,and,his,explosions,<END>
scarlett,did,not,mean,to,be,short,tempered,and,she,really,wanted,to,make,frank,a,good,wife,for,she,was,fond,of,him,and,grateful,for,his,help,in,saving,tara,<END>
but,he,did,try,her,patience,to,the,breaking,point,so,often,and,in,so,many,different,ways,<END>
she,could,never,respect,a,man,who,let,her,run,over,him,and,the,timid,hesitant,attitude,he,displayed,in,any,unpleasant,situation,with,her,or,with,others,irritated,her,unbearably,<END>
but,she,could,have,overlooked,these,things,and,even,been,happy,now,that,some,of,her,money,problems,were,being,solved,except,for,her,constantly,renewed,exasperation,growing,out,of,the,many,incidents,which,showed,that,frank,was,neither,a,good,business,man,nor,did,he,want,her,to,be,a,good,business,man,<END>
as,she,expected,he,had,refused,to,collect,the,unpaid,bills,until,she,prodded,him,into,it,and,then,he,had,done,it,apologetically,and,half,heartedly,<END>
that,experience,was,the,final,evidence,she,needed,to,show,her,that,the,kennedy,family,would,never,have,more,than,a,bare,living,unless,she,personally,made,the,money,she,was,determined,to,have,<END>
she,knew,now,that,frank,would,be,contented,to,dawdle,along,with,his,dirty,little,store,for,the,rest,of,his,life,<END>
he,didn't,seem,to,realize,what,a,slender,fingerhold,they,had,on,security,and,how,important,it,was,to,make,more,money,in,these,troublous,times,when,money,was,the,only,protection,against,fresh,calamities,<END>
frank,might,have,been,a,successful,business,man,in,the,easy,days,before,the,war,but,he,was,so,annoyingly,old-fashioned,she,thought,and,so,stubborn,about,wanting,to,do,things,in,the,old,ways,when,the,old,ways,and,the,old,days,were,gone,<END>
he,was,utterly,lacking,in,the,aggressiveness,needed,in,these,new,bitter,times,<END>
well,she,had,the,aggressiveness,and,she,intended,to,use,it,whether,frank,liked,it,or,not,<END>
they,needed,money,and,she,was,making,money,and,it,was,hard,work,<END>
the,very,least,frank,could,do,in,her,opinion,was,not,to,interfere,with,her,plans,which,were,getting,results,<END>
with,her,inexperience,operating,the,new,mill,was,no,easy,job,and,competition,was,keener,now,than,it,had,been,at,first,so,she,was,usually,tired,and,worried,and,cross,when,she,came,home,at,nights,<END>
and,when,frank,would,cough,apologetically,and,say,sugar,i,wouldn't,do,this,or,i,wouldn't,do,that,sugar,if,i,were,you,it,was,all,she,could,do,to,restrain,herself,from,flying,into,a,rage,and,frequently,she,did,not,restrain,herself,<END>
if,he,didn't,have,the,gumption,to,get,out,and,make,some,money,why,was,he,always,finding,fault,with,her,<END>
and,the,things,he,nagged,her,about,were,so,silly,<END>
what,difference,did,it,make,in,times,like,these,if,she,was,being,unwomanly,<END>
especially,when,her,unwomanly,sawmill,was,bringing,in,money,they,needed,so,badly,she,and,the,family,and,tara,and,frank,too,<END>
frank,wanted,rest,and,quiet,<END>
the,war,in,which,he,had,served,so,conscientiously,had,wrecked,his,health,cost,him,his,fortune,and,made,him,an,old,man,<END>
he,regretted,none,of,these,things,and,after,four,years,of,war,all,he,asked,of,life,was,peace,and,kindliness,loving,faces,about,him,and,the,approval,of,friends,<END>
he,soon,found,that,domestic,peace,had,its,price,and,that,price,was,letting,scarlett,have,her,own,way,no,matter,what,she,might,wish,to,do,<END>
so,because,he,was,tired,he,bought,peace,at,her,own,terms,<END>
sometimes,he,thought,it,was,worth,it,to,have,her,smiling,when,she,opened,the,front,door,in,the,cold,twilights,kissing,him,on,the,ear,or,the,nose,or,some,other,inappropriate,place,to,feel,her,head,snuggling,drowsily,on,his,shoulder,at,night,under,warm,quilts,<END>
home,life,could,be,so,pleasant,when,scarlett,was,having,her,own,way,<END>
but,the,peace,he,gained,was,hollow,only,an,outward,semblance,for,he,had,purchased,it,at,the,cost,of,everything,he,held,to,be,right,in,married,life,<END>
a,woman,ought,to,pay,more,attention,to,her,home,and,her,family,and,not,be,gadding,about,like,a,man,he,thought,<END>
now,if,she,just,had,a,baby,<END>
he,smiled,when,he,thought,of,a,baby,and,he,thought,of,a,baby,very,often,<END>
scarlett,had,been,most,outspoken,about,not,wanting,a,child,but,then,babies,seldom,waited,to,be,invited,<END>
frank,knew,that,many,women,said,they,didn't,want,babies,but,that,was,all,foolishness,and,fear,<END>
if,scarlett,had,a,baby,she,would,love,it,and,be,content,to,stay,home,and,tend,it,like,other,women,<END>
then,she,would,be,forced,to,sell,the,mill,and,his,problems,would,be,ended,<END>
all,women,needed,babies,to,make,them,completely,happy,and,frank,knew,that,scarlett,was,not,happy,<END>
ignorant,as,he,was,of,women,he,was,not,so,blind,that,he,could,not,see,she,was,unhappy,at,times,<END>
sometimes,he,awoke,at,night,and,heard,the,soft,sound,of,tears,muffled,in,the,pillow,<END>
the,first,time,he,had,waked,to,feel,the,bed,shaking,with,her,sobbing,he,had,questioned,in,alarm,sugar,what,is,it,<END>
and,had,been,rebuked,by,a,passionate,cry,oh,let,me,alone,<END>
yes,a,baby,would,make,her,happy,and,would,take,her,mind,off,things,she,had,no,business,fooling,with,<END>
sometimes,frank,sighed,thinking,he,had,caught,a,tropic,bird,all,flame,and,jewel,color,when,a,wren,would,have,served,him,just,as,well,<END>
in,fact,much,better,<END>
chapter,xxxvii,<END>
it,was,on,a,wild,wet,night,in,april,that,tony,fontaine,rode,in,from,jonesboro,on,a,lathered,horse,that,was,half,dead,from,exhaustion,and,came,knocking,at,their,door,rousing,her,and,frank,from,sleep,with,their,hearts,in,their,throats,<END>
then,for,the,second,time,in,four,months,scarlett,was,made,to,feel,acutely,what,reconstruction,in,all,its,implications,meant,made,to,understand,more,completely,what,was,in,will's,mind,when,he,said,our,troubles,have,just,begun,to,know,that,the,bleak,words,of,ashley,spoken,in,the,wind-,swept,orchard,of,tara,were,true,this,that's,facing,all,of,us,is,worse,than,war,worse,than,prison,worse,than,death,<END>
the,first,time,she,had,come,face,to,face,with,reconstruction,was,when,she,learned,that,jonas,wilkerson,with,the,aid,of,the,yankees,could,evict,her,from,tara,<END>
but,tony's,advent,brought,it,all,home,to,her,in,a,far,more,terrifying,manner,<END>
tony,came,in,the,dark,and,the,lashing,rain,and,in,a,few,minutes,he,was,gone,back,into,the,night,forever,but,in,the,brief,interval,between,he,raised,the,curtain,on,a,scene,of,new,horror,a,curtain,that,she,felt,hopelessly,would,never,be,lowered,again,<END>
that,stormy,night,when,the,knocker,hammered,on,the,door,with,such,hurried,urgency,she,stood,on,the,landing,clutching,her,wrapper,to,her,and,looking,down,into,the,hall,below,had,one,glimpse,of,tony's,swarthy,saturnine,face,before,he,leaned,forward,and,blew,out,the,candle,in,frank's,hand,<END>
she,hurried,down,in,the,darkness,to,grasp,his,cold,wet,hand,and,hear,him,whisper,they're,after,me,going,to,texas,my,horse,is,about,dead,and,i'm,about,starved,<END>
ashley,said,you'd,don't,light,the,candle,<END>
don't,wake,the,darkies,<END>
i,don't,want,to,get,you,folks,in,trouble,if,i,can,help,it,<END>
with,the,kitchen,blinds,drawn,and,all,the,shades,pulled,down,to,the,sills,he,permitted,a,light,and,he,talked,to,frank,in,swift,jerky,sentences,as,scarlett,hurried,about,trying,to,scrape,together,a,meal,for,him,<END>
he,was,without,a,greatcoat,and,soaked,to,the,skin,<END>
he,was,hatless,and,his,black,hair,was,plastered,to,his,little,skull,<END>
but,the,merriment,of,the,fontaine,boys,a,chilling,merriment,that,night,was,in,his,little,dancing,eyes,as,he,gulped,down,the,whisky,she,brought,him,<END>
scarlett,thanked,god,that,aunt,pittypat,was,snoring,undisturbed,upstairs,<END>
she,would,certainly,swoon,if,she,saw,this,apparition,<END>
one,damned,bast,scallawag,less,said,tony,holding,out,his,glass,for,another,drink,<END>
i've,ridden,hard,and,it'll,cost,me,my,skin,if,i,don't,get,out,of,here,quick,but,it,was,worth,it,<END>
by,god,yes,<END>
i'm,going,to,try,to,get,to,texas,and,lay,low,there,<END>
ashley,was,with,me,in,jonesboro,and,he,told,me,to,come,to,you,all,<END>
got,to,have,another,horse,frank,and,some,money,<END>
my,horse,is,nearly,dead,all,the,way,up,here,at,a,dead,run,and,like,a,fool,i,went,out,of,the,house,today,like,a,bat,out,of,hell,without,a,coat,or,hat,or,a,cent,of,money,<END>
not,that,there's,much,money,in,our,house,<END>
he,laughed,and,applied,himself,hungrily,to,the,cold,corn,pone,and,cold,turnip,greens,on,which,congealed,grease,was,thick,in,white,flakes,<END>
you,can,have,my,horse,said,frank,calmly,<END>
i've,only,ten,dollars,with,me,but,if,you,can,wait,till,morning,<END>
hell's,afire,i,can't,wait,<END>
said,tony,emphatically,but,jovially,<END>
they're,probably,right,behind,me,<END>
i,didn't,get,much,of,a,start,<END>
if,it,hadn't,been,for,ashley,dragging,me,out,of,there,and,making,me,get,on,my,horse,i'd,have,stayed,there,like,a,fool,and,probably,had,my,neck,stretched,by,now,<END>
good,fellow,ashley,<END>
so,ashley,was,mixed,up,in,this,frightening,puzzle,<END>
scarlett,went,cold,her,hand,at,her,throat,<END>
did,the,yankees,have,ashley,now,<END>
why,why,didn't,frank,ask,what,it,was,all,about,<END>
why,did,he,take,it,all,so,coolly,so,much,as,a,matter,of,course,<END>
she,struggled,to,get,the,question,to,her,lips,<END>
what,she,began,<END>
who,<END>
your,father's,old,overseer,that,damned,jonas,wilkerson,<END>
did,you,is,he,dead,<END>
my,god,scarlett,o'hara,<END>
said,tony,peevishly,<END>
when,i,start,out,to,cut,somebody,up,you,don't,think,i'd,be,satisfied,with,scratching,him,with,the,blunt,side,of,my,knife,do,you,<END>
no,by,god,i,cut,him,to,ribbons,<END>
good,said,frank,casually,<END>
i,never,liked,the,fellow,<END>
scarlett,looked,at,him,<END>
this,was,not,the,meek,frank,she,knew,the,nervous,beard,clawer,who,she,had,learned,could,be,bullied,with,such,ease,<END>
there,was,an,air,about,him,that,was,crisp,and,cool,and,he,was,meeting,the,emergency,with,no,unnecessary,words,<END>
he,was,a,man,and,tony,was,a,man,and,this,situation,of,violence,was,men's,business,in,which,a,woman,had,no,part,<END>
but,ashley,did,he,<END>
no,<END>
he,wanted,to,kill,him,but,i,told,him,it,was,my,right,because,sally,is,my,sister-in-law,and,he,saw,reason,finally,<END>
he,went,into,jonesboro,with,me,in,case,wilkerson,got,me,first,<END>
but,i,don't,think,old,ash,will,get,in,any,trouble,about,it,<END>
i,hope,not,<END>
got,any,jam,for,this,corn,pone,<END>
and,can,you,wrap,me,up,something,to,take,with,me,<END>
i,shall,scream,if,you,don't,tell,me,everything,<END>
wait,till,i've,gone,and,then,scream,if,you've,got,to,<END>
i'll,tell,you,about,it,while,frank,saddles,the,horse,<END>
that,damned,wilkerson,has,caused,enough,trouble,already,<END>
i,know,how,he,did,you,about,your,taxes,<END>
that's,just,one,of,his,meannesses,<END>
but,the,worst,thing,was,the,way,he,kept,the,darkies,stirred,up,<END>
if,anybody,had,told,me,i'd,ever,live,to,see,the,day,when,i'd,hate,darkies,<END>
damn,their,black,souls,they,believe,anything,those,scoundrels,tell,them,and,forget,every,living,thing,we've,done,for,them,<END>
now,the,yankees,are,talking,about,letting,the,darkies,vote,<END>
and,they,won't,let,us,vote,<END>
why,there's,hardly,a,handful,of,democrats,in,the,whole,county,who,aren't,barred,from,voting,now,that,they've,ruled,out,every,man,who,fought,in,the,confederate,army,<END>
and,if,they,give,the,negroes,the,vote,it's,the,end,of,us,<END>
damn,it,it's,our,state,<END>
it,doesn't,belong,to,the,yankees,<END>
by,god,scarlett,it,isn't,to,be,borne,<END>
and,it,won't,be,borne,<END>
we'll,do,something,about,it,if,it,means,another,war,<END>
soon,we'll,be,having,nigger,judges,nigger,legislators,black,apes,out,of,the,jungle,<END>
please,hurry,tell,me,<END>
what,did,you,do,<END>
give,me,another,mite,of,that,pone,before,you,wrap,it,up,<END>
well,the,word,got,around,that,wilkerson,had,gone,a,bit,too,far,with,his,nigger-equality,business,<END>
oh,yes,he,talks,it,to,those,black,fools,by,the,hour,<END>
he,had,the,gall,the,tony,spluttered,helplessly,to,say,niggers,had,a,right,to,to,white,women,<END>
oh,tony,no,<END>
by,god,yes,<END>
i,don't,wonder,you,look,sick,<END>
but,hell's,afire,scarlett,it,can't,be,news,to,you,<END>
they've,been,telling,it,to,them,here,in,atlanta,<END>
i,i,didn't,know,<END>
well,frank,would,have,kept,it,from,you,<END>
anyway,after,that,we,all,sort,of,thought,we'd,call,on,mr,wilkerson,privately,by,night,and,tend,to,him,but,before,we,could,you,remember,that,black,buck,eustis,who,used,to,be,our,foreman,<END>
yes,<END>
came,to,the,kitchen,door,today,while,sally,was,fixing,dinner,and,i,don't,know,what,he,said,to,her,<END>
i,guess,i'll,never,know,now,<END>
but,he,said,something,and,i,heard,her,scream,and,i,ran,into,the,kitchen,and,there,he,was,drunk,as,a,fiddler's,bitch,i,beg,your,pardon,scarlett,it,just,slipped,out,<END>
go,on,<END>
i,shot,him,and,when,mother,ran,in,to,take,care,of,sally,i,got,my,horse,and,started,to,jonesboro,for,wilkerson,<END>
he,was,the,one,to,blame,<END>
the,damned,black,fool,would,never,have,thought,of,it,but,for,him,<END>
and,on,the,way,past,tara,i,met,ashley,and,of,course,he,went,with,me,<END>
he,said,to,let,him,do,it,because,of,the,way,wilkerson,acted,about,tara,and,i,said,no,it,was,my,place,because,sally,was,my,own,dead,brother's,wife,and,he,went,with,me,arguing,the,whole,way,<END>
and,when,we,got,to,town,by,god,scarlett,do,you,know,i,hadn't,even,brought,my,pistol,i'd,left,it,in,the,stable,<END>
so,mad,i,forgot,<END>
he,paused,and,gnawed,the,tough,pone,and,scarlett,shivered,<END>
the,murderous,rages,of,the,fontaines,had,made,county,history,long,before,this,chapter,had,opened,<END>
so,i,had,to,take,my,knife,to,him,<END>
i,found,him,in,the,barroom,<END>
i,got,him,in,a,corner,with,ashley,holding,back,the,others,and,i,told,him,why,before,i,lit,into,him,<END>
why,it,was,over,before,i,knew,it,said,tony,reflecting,<END>
first,thing,i,knew,ashley,had,me,on,my,horse,and,told,me,to,come,to,you,folks,<END>
ashley's,a,good,man,in,a,pinch,<END>
he,keeps,his,head,<END>
frank,came,in,his,greatcoat,over,his,arm,and,handed,it,to,tony,<END>
it,was,his,only,heavy,coat,but,scarlett,made,no,protest,<END>
she,seemed,so,much,on,the,outside,of,this,affair,this,purely,masculine,affair,<END>
but,tony,they,need,you,at,home,<END>
surely,if,you,went,back,and,explained,<END>
frank,you've,married,a,fool,said,tony,with,a,grin,struggling,into,the,coat,<END>
she,thinks,the,yankees,will,reward,a,man,for,keeping,niggers,off,his,women,folks,<END>
so,they,will,with,a,drumhead,court,and,a,rope,<END>
give,me,a,kiss,scarlett,<END>
frank,won't,mind,and,i,may,never,see,you,again,<END>
texas,is,a,long,way,off,<END>
i,won't,dare,write,so,let,the,home,folks,know,i,got,this,far,in,safety,<END>
she,let,him,kiss,her,and,the,two,men,went,out,into,the,driving,rain,and,stood,for,a,moment,talking,on,the,back,porch,<END>
then,she,heard,a,sudden,splashing,of,hooves,and,tony,was,gone,<END>
she,opened,the,door,a,crack,and,saw,frank,leading,a,heaving,stumbling,horse,into,the,carriage,house,<END>
she,shut,the,door,again,and,sat,down,her,knees,trembling,<END>
now,she,knew,what,reconstruction,meant,knew,as,well,as,if,the,house,were,ringed,about,by,naked,savages,squatting,in,breech,clouts,<END>
now,there,came,rushing,to,her,mind,many,things,to,which,she,had,given,little,thought,recently,conversations,she,had,heard,but,to,which,she,had,not,listened,masculine,talk,which,had,been,checked,half,finished,when,she,came,into,rooms,small,incidents,in,which,she,had,seen,no,significance,at,the,time,frank's,futile,warnings,to,her,against,driving,out,to,the,mill,with,only,the,feeble,uncle,peter,to,protect,her,<END>
now,they,fitted,themselves,together,into,one,horrifying,picture,<END>
the,negroes,were,on,top,and,behind,them,were,the,yankee,bayonets,<END>
she,could,be,killed,she,could,be,raped,and,very,probably,nothing,would,ever,be,done,about,it,<END>
and,anyone,who,avenged,her,would,be,hanged,by,the,yankees,hanged,without,benefit,of,trial,by,judge,and,jury,<END>
yankee,officers,who,knew,nothing,of,law,and,cared,less,for,the,circumstances,of,the,crime,could,go,through,the,motions,of,holding,a,trial,and,put,a,rope,around,a,southerner's,neck,<END>
what,can,we,do,<END>
she,thought,wringing,her,hands,in,an,agony,of,helpless,fear,<END>
what,can,we,do,with,devils,who'd,hang,a,nice,boy,like,tony,just,for,killing,a,drunken,buck,and,a,scoundrelly,scallawag,to,protect,his,women,folks,<END>
it,isn't,to,be,borne,<END>
tony,had,cried,and,he,was,right,<END>
it,couldn't,be,borne,<END>
but,what,could,they,do,except,bear,it,helpless,as,they,were,<END>
she,fell,to,trembling,and,for,the,first,time,in,her,life,she,saw,people,and,events,as,something,apart,from,herself,saw,clearly,that,scarlett,o'hara,frightened,and,helpless,was,not,all,that,mattered,<END>
there,were,thousands,of,women,like,her,all,over,the,south,who,were,frightened,and,helpless,<END>
and,thousands,of,men,who,had,laid,down,their,arms,at,appomattox,had,taken,them,up,again,and,stood,ready,to,risk,their,necks,on,a,minute's,notice,to,protect,those,women,<END>
there,had,been,something,in,tony's,face,which,had,been,mirrored,in,frank's,an,expression,she,had,seen,recently,on,the,faces,of,other,men,in,atlanta,a,look,she,had,noticed,but,had,not,troubled,to,analyze,<END>
it,was,an,expression,vastly,different,from,the,tired,helplessness,she,had,seen,in,the,faces,of,men,coming,home,from,the,war,after,the,surrender,<END>
those,men,had,not,cared,about,anything,except,getting,home,<END>
now,they,were,caring,about,something,again,numbed,nerves,were,coming,back,to,life,and,the,old,spirit,was,beginning,to,burn,<END>
they,were,caring,again,with,a,cold,ruthless,bitterness,<END>
and,like,tony,they,were,thinking,it,isn't,to,be,borne,<END>
she,had,seen,southern,men,soft,voiced,and,dangerous,in,the,days,before,the,war,reckless,and,hard,in,the,last,despairing,days,of,the,fighting,<END>
but,in,the,faces,of,the,two,men,who,stared,at,each,other,across,the,candle,flame,so,short,a,while,ago,there,had,been,something,that,was,different,something,that,heartened,her,but,frightened,her,fury,which,could,find,no,words,determination,which,would,stop,at,nothing,<END>
for,the,first,time,she,felt,a,kinship,with,the,people,about,her,felt,one,with,them,in,their,fears,their,bitterness,their,determination,<END>
no,it,wasn't,to,be,borne,<END>
the,south,was,too,beautiful,a,place,to,be,let,go,without,a,struggle,too,loved,to,be,trampled,by,yankees,who,hated,southerners,enough,to,enjoy,grinding,them,into,the,dirt,too,dear,a,homeland,to,be,turned,over,to,ignorant,negroes,drunk,with,whisky,and,freedom,<END>
as,she,thought,of,tony's,sudden,entrance,and,swift,exit,she,felt,herself,akin,to,him,for,she,remembered,the,old,story,how,her,father,had,left,ireland,left,hastily,and,by,night,after,a,murder,which,was,no,murder,to,him,or,to,his,family,<END>
gerald's,blood,was,in,her,violent,blood,<END>
she,remembered,her,hot,joy,in,shooting,the,marauding,yankee,<END>
violent,blood,was,in,them,all,perilously,close,to,the,surface,lurking,just,beneath,the,kindly,courteous,exteriors,<END>
all,of,them,all,the,men,she,knew,even,the,drowsy-eyed,ashley,and,fidgety,old,frank,were,like,that,underneath,murderous,violent,if,the,need,arose,<END>
even,rhett,conscienceless,scamp,that,he,was,had,killed,a,negro,for,being,uppity,to,a,lady,<END>
oh,frank,how,long,will,it,be,like,this,<END>
she,leaped,to,her,feet,<END>
as,long,as,the,yankees,hate,us,so,sugar,<END>
is,there,nothing,anybody,can,do,<END>
frank,passed,a,tired,hand,over,his,wet,beard,<END>
we,are,doing,things,<END>
what,<END>
why,talk,of,them,till,we,have,accomplished,something,<END>
it,may,take,years,<END>
perhaps,perhaps,the,south,will,always,be,like,this,<END>
oh,no,<END>
sugar,come,to,bed,<END>
you,must,be,chilled,<END>
you,are,shaking,<END>
when,will,it,all,end,<END>
when,we,can,all,vote,again,sugar,<END>
when,every,man,who,fought,for,the,south,can,put,a,ballot,in,the,box,for,a,southerner,and,a,democrat,<END>
a,ballot,<END>
she,cried,despairingly,<END>
what,good's,a,ballot,when,the,darkies,have,lost,their,minds,when,the,yankees,have,poisoned,them,against,us,<END>
frank,went,on,to,explain,in,his,patient,manner,but,the,idea,that,ballots,could,cure,the,trouble,was,too,complicated,for,her,to,follow,<END>
she,was,thinking,gratefully,that,jonas,wilkerson,would,never,again,be,a,menace,of,tara,and,she,was,thinking,about,tony,<END>
oh,the,poor,fontaines,<END>
she,exclaimed,<END>
only,alex,left,and,so,much,to,do,at,mimosa,<END>
why,didn't,tony,have,sense,enough,to,to,do,it,at,night,when,no,one,would,know,who,it,was,<END>

the,wave,of,rebuilding,was,giving,her,the,opportunity,she,wanted,and,she,knew,she,could,make,money,if,only,she,could,stay,out,of,jail,<END>

she,hated,the,impudent,free,negroes,as,much,as,anyone,and,her,flesh,crawled,with,fury,every,time,she,heard,their,insulting,remarks,and,high-pitched,laughter,as,she,went,by,<END>

by,that,month,scarlett,knew,she,would,be,forced,to,retire,into,aunt,pitty's,house,and,remain,secluded,there,until,after,her,child,was,born,<END>

by,june,she,must,have,the,mill,well,enough,established,for,her,to,leave,it,<END>
by,june,she,must,have,money,enough,to,give,her,at,least,some,little,protection,against,misfortune,<END>
so,much,to,do,and,so,little,time,to,do,it,<END>
she,wished,for,more,hours,of,the,day,and,counted,the,minutes,as,she,strained,forward,feverishly,in,her,pursuit,of,money,and,still,more,money,<END>
because,she,nagged,the,timid,frank,the,store,was,doing,better,now,and,he,was,even,collecting,some,of,the,old,bills,<END>
but,it,was,the,sawmill,on,which,her,hopes,were,pinned,<END>
atlanta,these,days,was,like,a,giant,plant,which,had,been,cut,to,the,ground,but,now,was,springing,up,again,with,sturdier,shoots,thicker,foliage,more,numerous,branches,<END>
the,demand,for,building,materials,was,far,greater,than,could,be,supplied,<END>
prices,of,lumber,brick,and,stone,soared,and,scarlett,kept,the,mill,running,from,dawn,until,lantern,light,<END>
a,part,of,every,day,she,spent,at,the,mill,prying,into,everything,doing,her,best,to,check,the,thievery,she,felt,sure,was,going,on,<END>
but,most,of,the,time,she,was,riding,about,the,town,making,the,rounds,of,builders,contractors,and,carpenters,even,calling,on,strangers,she,had,heard,might,build,at,future,dates,cajoling,them,into,promises,of,buying,from,her,and,her,only,<END>
soon,she,was,a,familiar,sight,on,atlanta's,streets,sitting,in,her,buggy,beside,the,dignified,disapproving,old,darky,driver,a,lap,robe,pulled,high,about,her,her,little,mittened,hands,clasped,in,her,lap,<END>
aunt,pitty,had,made,her,a,pretty,green,mantelet,which,hid,her,figure,and,a,green,pancake,hat,which,matched,her,eyes,and,she,always,wore,these,becoming,garments,on,her,business,calls,<END>
a,faint,dab,of,rouge,on,her,cheeks,and,a,fainter,fragrance,of,cologne,made,her,a,charming,picture,as,long,as,she,did,not,alight,from,the,buggy,and,show,her,figure,<END>
and,there,was,seldom,any,need,for,this,for,she,smiled,and,beckoned,and,the,men,came,quickly,to,the,buggy,and,frequently,stood,bareheaded,in,the,rain,to,talk,business,with,her,<END>
she,was,not,the,only,one,who,had,seen,the,opportunities,for,making,money,out,of,lumber,but,she,did,not,fear,her,competitors,<END>
she,knew,with,conscious,pride,in,her,own,smartness,that,she,was,the,equal,of,any,of,them,<END>
she,was,gerald's,own,daughter,and,the,shrewd,trading,instinct,she,had,inherited,was,now,sharpened,by,her,needs,<END>
at,first,the,other,dealers,had,laughed,at,her,laughed,with,good-,natured,contempt,at,the,very,idea,of,a,woman,in,business,<END>
but,now,they,did,not,laugh,<END>
they,swore,silently,as,they,saw,her,ride,by,<END>
the,fact,that,she,was,a,woman,frequently,worked,in,her,favor,for,she,could,upon,occasion,look,so,helpless,and,appealing,that,she,melted,hearts,<END>
with,no,difficulty,whatever,she,could,mutely,convey,the,impression,of,a,brave,but,timid,lady,forced,by,brutal,circumstance,into,a,distasteful,position,a,helpless,little,lady,who,would,probably,starve,if,customers,didn't,buy,her,lumber,<END>
but,when,ladylike,airs,failed,to,get,results,she,was,coldly,businesslike,and,willingly,undersold,her,competitors,at,a,loss,to,herself,if,it,would,bring,her,a,new,customer,<END>
she,was,not,above,selling,a,poor,grade,of,lumber,for,the,price,of,good,lumber,if,she,thought,she,would,not,be,detected,and,she,had,no,scruples,about,black-guarding,the,other,lumber,dealers,<END>
with,every,appearance,of,reluctance,at,disclosing,the,unpleasant,truth,she,would,sigh,and,tell,prospective,customers,that,her,competitors',lumber,was,far,too,high,in,price,rotten,full,of,knot,holes,and,in,general,of,deplorably,poor,quality,<END>
the,first,time,scarlett,lied,in,this,fashion,she,felt,disconcerted,and,guilty,disconcerted,because,the,lie,sprang,so,easily,and,naturally,to,her,lips,guilty,because,the,thought,flashed,into,her,mind,what,would,mother,say,<END>
there,was,no,doubt,what,ellen,would,say,to,a,daughter,who,told,lies,and,engaged,in,sharp,practices,<END>
she,would,be,stunned,and,incredulous,and,would,speak,gentle,words,that,stung,despite,their,gentleness,would,talk,of,honor,and,honesty,and,truth,and,duty,to,one's,neighbor,<END>
momentarily,scarlett,cringed,as,she,pictured,the,look,on,her,mother's,face,<END>
and,then,the,picture,faded,blotted,out,by,an,impulse,hard,unscrupulous,and,greedy,which,had,been,born,in,the,lean,days,at,tara,and,was,now,strengthened,by,the,present,uncertainty,of,life,<END>
so,she,passed,this,milestone,as,she,had,passed,others,before,it,with,a,sigh,that,she,was,not,as,ellen,would,like,her,to,be,a,shrug,and,the,repetition,of,her,unfailing,charm,i'll,think,of,all,this,later,<END>
but,she,never,again,thought,of,ellen,in,connection,with,her,business,practices,never,again,regretted,any,means,she,used,to,take,trade,away,from,other,lumber,dealers,<END>
she,knew,she,was,perfectly,safe,in,lying,about,them,<END>
southern,chivalry,protected,her,<END>
a,southern,lady,could,lie,about,a,gentleman,but,a,southern,gentleman,could,not,lie,about,a,lady,or,worse,still,call,the,lady,a,liar,<END>
other,lumbermen,could,only,fume,inwardly,and,state,heatedly,in,the,bosoms,of,their,families,that,they,wished,to,god,mrs,kennedy,was,a,man,for,just,about,five,minutes,<END>
one,poor,white,who,operated,a,mill,on,the,decatur,road,did,try,to,fight,scarlett,with,her,own,weapons,saying,openly,that,she,was,a,liar,and,a,swindler,<END>
but,it,hurt,him,rather,than,helped,for,everyone,was,appalled,that,even,a,poor,white,should,say,such,shocking,things,about,a,lady,of,good,family,even,when,the,lady,was,conducting,herself,in,such,an,unwomanly,way,<END>
scarlett,bore,his,remarks,with,silent,dignity,and,as,time,went,by,she,turned,all,her,attention,to,him,and,his,customers,<END>
she,undersold,him,so,relentlessly,and,delivered,with,secret,groans,such,an,excellent,quality,of,lumber,to,prove,her,probity,that,he,was,soon,bankrupt,<END>
then,to,frank's,horror,she,triumphantly,bought,his,mill,at,her,own,price,<END>
once,in,her,possession,there,arose,the,perplexing,problem,of,finding,a,trustworthy,man,to,put,in,charge,of,it,<END>
she,did,not,want,another,man,like,mr,johnson,<END>
she,knew,that,despite,all,her,watchfulness,he,was,still,selling,her,lumber,behind,her,back,but,she,thought,it,would,be,easy,to,find,the,right,sort,of,man,<END>
wasn't,everybody,as,poor,as,job's,turkey,and,weren't,the,streets,full,of,men,some,of,them,formerly,rich,who,were,without,work,<END>

it,was,the,same,with,the,dozen,others,she,approached,<END>

but,to,her,mind,there,were,few,if,any,qualities,that,out-weighed,gumption,<END>
after,she,had,unsuccessfully,canvassed,the,town,and,refused,the,importuning,of,many,eager,carpetbaggers,she,finally,decided,to,take,tommy's,suggestion,and,ask,hugh,elsing,<END>
he,had,been,a,dashing,and,resourceful,officer,during,the,war,but,two,severe,wounds,and,four,years,of,fighting,seemed,to,have,drained,him,of,all,his,resourcefulness,leaving,him,to,face,the,rigors,of,peace,as,bewildered,as,a,child,<END>
there,was,a,lost-dog,look,in,his,eyes,these,days,as,he,went,about,peddling,his,firewood,and,he,was,not,at,all,the,kind,of,man,she,had,hoped,to,get,<END>

it's,a,pity,johnnie,gallegher,is,tied,up,with,tommy,wellburn,on,that,construction,work,she,thought,<END>
he's,just,the,kind,of,man,i,want,<END>

of,course,frank,was,making,a,little,more,money,now,but,frank,was,always,ailing,with,colds,and,frequently,forced,to,stay,in,bed,for,days,<END>

no,she,could,not,afford,to,count,on,frank,for,much,<END>
she,must,not,count,on,anything,or,anybody,but,herself,<END>

she,would,not,put,the,money,in,the,bank,for,it,might,fail,or,the,yankees,might,confiscate,it,<END>
so,she,carried,what,she,could,with,her,tucked,into,her,corset,and,hid,small,wads,of,bills,about,the,house,under,loose,bricks,on,the,hearth,in,her,scrap,bag,between,the,pages,of,the,bible,<END>

frank,pitty,and,the,servants,bore,her,outbursts,with,maddening,kindness,attributing,her,bad,disposition,to,her,pregnancy,never,realizing,the,true,cause,<END>
frank,knew,that,pregnant,women,must,be,humored,so,he,put,his,pride,in,his,pocket,and,said,nothing,more,about,her,running,the,mills,and,her,going,about,town,at,such,a,time,as,no,lady,should,do,<END>
her,conduct,was,a,constant,embarrassment,to,him,but,he,reckoned,he,could,endure,it,for,a,while,longer,<END>
after,the,baby,came,he,knew,she,would,be,the,same,sweet,feminine,girl,he,had,courted,<END>
but,in,spite,of,everything,he,did,to,appease,her,she,continued,to,have,her,tantrums,and,often,he,thought,she,acted,like,one,possessed,<END>
no,one,seemed,to,realize,what,really,possessed,her,what,drove,her,like,a,mad,woman,<END>
it,was,a,passion,to,get,her,affairs,in,order,before,she,had,to,retire,behind,doors,to,have,as,much,money,as,possible,in,case,the,deluge,broke,upon,her,again,to,have,a,stout,levee,of,cash,against,the,rising,tide,of,yankee,hate,<END>
money,was,the,obsession,dominating,her,mind,these,days,<END>
when,she,thought,of,the,baby,at,all,it,was,with,baffled,rage,at,the,untimeliness,of,it,<END>
death,and,taxes,and,childbirth,<END>
there's,never,any,convenient,time,for,any,of,them,<END>
atlanta,had,been,scandalized,enough,when,scarlett,a,woman,began,operating,the,sawmill,but,as,time,went,by,the,town,decided,there,was,no,limit,to,what,she,would,do,<END>
her,sharp,trading,was,shocking,especially,when,her,poor,mother,had,been,a,robillard,and,it,was,positively,indecent,the,way,she,kept,on,going,about,the,streets,when,everyone,knew,she,was,pregnant,<END>
no,respectable,white,woman,and,few,negroes,ever,went,outside,their,homes,from,the,moment,they,first,suspected,they,were,with,child,and,mrs,merriwether,declared,indignantly,that,from,the,way,scarlett,was,acting,she,was,likely,to,have,the,baby,on,the,public,streets,<END>
but,all,the,previous,criticism,of,her,conduct,was,as,nothing,compared,with,the,buzz,of,gossip,that,now,went,through,the,town,<END>
scarlett,was,not,only,trafficking,with,the,yankees,but,was,giving,every,appearance,of,really,liking,it,<END>
mrs,merriwether,and,many,other,southerners,were,also,doing,business,with,the,newcomers,from,the,north,but,the,difference,was,that,they,did,not,like,it,and,plainly,showed,they,did,not,like,it,<END>
and,scarlett,did,or,seemed,to,which,was,just,as,bad,<END>
she,had,actually,taken,tea,with,the,yankee,officers',wives,in,their,homes,<END>
in,fact,she,had,done,practically,everything,short,of,inviting,them,into,her,own,home,and,the,town,guessed,she,would,do,even,that,except,for,aunt,pitty,and,frank,<END>
scarlett,knew,the,town,was,talking,but,she,did,not,care,could,not,afford,to,care,<END>
she,still,hated,the,yankees,with,as,fierce,a,hate,as,on,the,day,when,they,tried,to,burn,tara,but,she,could,dissemble,that,hate,<END>
she,knew,that,if,she,was,going,to,make,money,she,would,have,to,make,it,out,of,the,yankees,and,she,had,learned,that,buttering,them,up,with,smiles,and,kind,words,was,the,surest,way,to,get,their,business,for,her,mill,<END>
some,day,when,she,was,very,rich,and,her,money,was,hidden,away,where,the,yankees,could,not,find,it,then,then,she,would,tell,them,exactly,what,she,thought,of,them,tell,them,how,she,hated,and,loathed,and,despised,them,<END>
and,what,a,joy,that,would,be,<END>
but,until,that,time,came,it,was,just,plain,common,sense,to,get,along,with,them,<END>
and,if,that,was,hypocrisy,let,atlanta,make,the,most,of,it,<END>
she,discovered,that,making,friends,with,the,yankee,officers,was,as,easy,as,shooting,birds,on,the,ground,<END>
they,were,lonely,exiles,in,a,hostile,land,and,many,of,them,were,starved,for,polite,feminine,associations,in,a,town,where,respectable,women,drew,their,skirts,aside,in,passing,and,looked,as,if,they,would,like,to,spit,on,them,<END>
only,the,prostitutes,and,the,negro,women,had,kind,words,for,them,<END>
but,scarlett,was,obviously,a,lady,and,a,lady,of,family,for,all,that,she,worked,and,they,thrilled,to,her,flashing,smile,and,the,pleasant,light,in,her,green,eyes,<END>
frequently,when,scarlett,sat,in,her,buggy,talking,to,them,and,making,her,dimples,play,her,dislike,for,them,rose,so,strong,that,it,was,hard,not,to,curse,them,to,their,faces,<END>
but,she,restrained,herself,and,she,found,that,twisting,yankee,men,around,her,finger,was,no,more,difficult,than,that,same,diversion,had,been,with,southern,men,<END>
only,this,was,no,diversion,but,a,grim,business,<END>
the,role,she,enacted,was,that,of,a,refined,sweet,southern,lady,in,distress,<END>
with,an,air,of,dignified,reserve,she,was,able,to,keep,her,victims,at,their,proper,distance,but,there,was,nevertheless,a,graciousness,in,her,manner,which,left,a,certain,warmth,in,the,yankee,officers',memories,of,mrs,kennedy,<END>
this,warmth,was,very,profitable,as,scarlett,had,intended,it,to,be,<END>
many,of,the,officers,of,the,garrison,not,knowing,how,long,they,would,be,stationed,in,atlanta,had,sent,for,their,wives,and,families,<END>
as,the,hotels,and,boarding,houses,were,overflowing,they,were,building,small,houses,and,they,were,glad,to,buy,their,lumber,from,the,gracious,mrs,kennedy,who,treated,them,more,politely,than,anyone,else,in,town,<END>
the,carpetbaggers,and,scallawags,also,who,were,building,fine,homes,and,stores,and,hotels,with,their,new,wealth,found,it,more,pleasant,to,do,business,with,her,than,with,the,former,confederate,soldiers,who,were,courteous,but,with,a,courtesy,more,formal,and,cold,than,outspoken,hate,<END>
so,because,she,was,pretty,and,charming,and,could,appear,quite,helpless,and,forlorn,at,times,they,gladly,patronized,her,lumber,yard,and,also,frank's,store,feeling,that,they,should,help,a,plucky,little,woman,who,apparently,had,only,a,shiftless,husband,to,support,her,<END>
and,scarlett,watching,the,business,grow,felt,that,she,was,safeguarding,not,only,the,present,with,yankee,money,but,the,future,with,yankee,friends,<END>
keeping,her,relations,with,the,yankee,officers,on,the,plane,she,desired,was,easier,than,she,expected,for,they,all,seemed,to,be,in,awe,of,southern,ladies,but,scarlett,soon,found,that,their,wives,presented,a,problem,she,had,not,anticipated,<END>
contacts,with,the,yankee,women,were,not,of,her,seeking,<END>
she,would,have,been,glad,to,avoid,them,but,she,could,not,for,the,officers',wives,were,determined,to,meet,her,<END>
they,had,an,avid,curiosity,about,the,south,and,southern,women,and,scarlett,gave,them,their,first,opportunity,to,satisfy,it,<END>
other,atlanta,women,would,have,nothing,to,do,with,them,and,even,refused,to,bow,to,them,in,church,so,when,business,brought,scarlett,to,their,homes,she,was,like,an,answer,to,prayer,<END>
often,when,scarlett,sat,in,her,buggy,in,front,of,a,yankee,home,talking,of,uprights,and,shingles,with,the,man,of,the,house,the,wife,came,out,to,join,in,the,conversation,or,insist,that,she,come,inside,for,a,cup,of,tea,<END>
scarlett,seldom,refused,no,matter,how,distasteful,the,idea,might,be,for,she,always,hoped,to,have,an,opportunity,to,suggest,tactfully,that,they,do,their,trading,at,frank's,store,<END>
but,her,self-control,was,severely,tested,many,times,because,of,the,personal,questions,they,asked,and,because,of,the,smug,and,condescending,attitude,they,displayed,toward,all,things,southern,<END>
accepting,uncle,tom's,cabin,as,revelation,second,only,to,the,bible,the,yankee,women,all,wanted,to,know,about,the,bloodhounds,which,every,southerner,kept,to,track,down,runaway,slaves,<END>
and,they,never,believed,her,when,she,told,them,she,had,only,seen,one,bloodhound,in,all,her,life,and,it,was,a,small,mild,dog,and,not,a,huge,ferocious,mastiff,<END>
they,wanted,to,know,about,the,dreadful,branding,irons,which,planters,used,to,mark,the,faces,of,their,slaves,and,the,cat-,o'-nine-tails,with,which,they,beat,them,to,death,and,they,evidenced,what,scarlett,felt,was,a,very,nasty,and,ill-bred,interest,in,slave,concubinage,<END>
especially,did,she,resent,this,in,view,of,the,enormous,increase,in,mulatto,babies,in,atlanta,since,the,yankee,soldiers,had,settled,in,the,town,<END>
any,other,atlanta,woman,would,have,expired,in,rage,at,having,to,listen,to,such,bigoted,ignorance,but,scarlett,managed,to,control,herself,<END>
assisting,her,in,this,was,the,fact,that,they,aroused,her,contempt,more,than,her,anger,<END>
after,all,they,were,yankees,and,no,one,expected,anything,better,from,yankees,<END>
so,their,unthinking,insults,to,her,state,her,people,and,their,morals,glanced,off,and,never,struck,deep,enough,to,cause,her,more,than,a,well-concealed,sneer,until,an,incident,occurred,which,made,her,sick,with,rage,and,showed,her,if,she,needed,any,showing,how,wide,was,the,gap,between,north,and,south,and,how,utterly,impossible,it,was,to,bridge,it,<END>
while,driving,home,with,uncle,peter,one,afternoon,she,passed,the,house,into,which,were,crowded,the,families,of,three,officers,who,were,building,their,own,homes,with,scarlett's,lumber,<END>
the,three,wives,were,standing,in,the,walk,as,she,drove,by,and,they,waved,to,her,to,stop,<END>
coming,out,to,the,carriage,block,they,greeted,her,in,accents,that,always,made,her,feel,that,one,could,forgive,yankees,almost,anything,except,their,voices,<END>
you,are,just,the,person,i,want,to,see,mrs,kennedy,said,a,tall,thin,woman,from,maine,<END>

scarlett,swallowed,the,insult,to,atlanta,with,the,contempt,it,deserved,and,smiled,her,best,<END>
and,what,can,i,tell,you,<END>
my,nurse,my,bridget,has,gone,back,north,<END>

personally,i've,never,seen,a,white,servant,and,i,shouldn't,care,to,have,one,in,my,house,<END>
and,she,could,not,keep,a,slight,note,of,sarcasm,from,her,words,i,assure,you,that,darkies,aren't,cannibals,and,are,quite,trustworthy,<END>
goodness,no,<END>

what,did,these,strangers,know,of,black,hands,how,dear,and,comforting,they,could,be,how,unerringly,they,knew,how,to,soothe,to,pat,to,fondle,<END>
she,laughed,shortly,<END>

i,wouldn't,trust,one,of,them,<END>
for,some,moments,scarlett,had,been,conscious,that,uncle,peter,was,breathing,hard,and,sitting,up,very,straight,as,he,stared,steadily,at,the,horse's,ears,<END>
her,attention,was,called,to,him,more,forcibly,when,the,maine,woman,broke,off,suddenly,with,a,laugh,and,pointed,him,out,to,her,companions,<END>
look,at,that,old,nigger,swell,up,like,a,toad,she,giggled,<END>

you,southerners,don't,know,how,to,treat,niggers,<END>
you,spoil,them,to,death,<END>
peter,sucked,in,his,breath,and,his,wrinkled,brow,showed,deep,furrows,but,he,kept,his,eyes,straight,ahead,<END>
he,had,never,had,the,term,nigger,applied,to,him,by,a,white,person,in,all,his,life,<END>
by,other,negroes,yes,<END>
but,never,by,a,white,person,<END>
and,to,be,called,untrustworthy,and,an,old,pet,he,peter,who,had,been,the,dignified,mainstay,of,the,hamilton,family,for,years,<END>
scarlett,felt,rather,than,saw,the,black,chin,begin,to,shake,with,hurt,pride,and,a,killing,rage,swept,over,her,<END>
she,had,listened,with,calm,contempt,while,these,women,had,underrated,the,confederate,army,blackguarded,jeff,davis,and,accused,southerners,of,murder,and,torture,of,their,slaves,<END>
if,it,were,to,her,advantage,she,would,have,endured,insults,about,her,own,virtue,and,honesty,<END>
but,the,knowledge,that,they,had,hurt,the,faithful,old,darky,with,their,stupid,remarks,fired,her,like,a,match,in,gunpowder,<END>
for,a,moment,she,looked,at,the,big,horse,pistol,in,peter's,belt,and,her,hands,itched,for,the,feel,of,it,<END>
they,deserved,killing,these,insolent,ignorant,arrogant,conquerors,<END>
but,she,bit,down,on,her,teeth,until,her,jaw,muscles,stood,out,reminding,herself,that,the,time,had,not,yet,come,when,she,could,tell,the,yankees,just,what,she,thought,of,them,<END>

instantly,a,passion,of,tenderness,of,grief,for,his,humiliation,swamped,her,made,her,eyes,sting,<END>

the,two,drove,home,in,silence,<END>
peter's,sniffles,stopped,and,his,underlip,began,to,protrude,gradually,until,it,stuck,out,alarmingly,<END>
his,indignation,was,mounting,now,that,the,initial,hurt,was,subsiding,<END>
scarlett,thought,what,damnably,queer,people,yankees,are,<END>
those,women,seemed,to,think,that,because,uncle,peter,was,black,he,had,no,ears,to,hear,with,and,no,feelings,as,tender,as,their,own,to,be,hurt,<END>
they,did,not,know,that,negroes,had,to,be,handled,gently,as,though,they,were,children,directed,praised,petted,scolded,<END>
they,didn't,understand,negroes,or,the,relations,between,the,negroes,and,their,former,masters,<END>
yet,they,had,fought,a,war,to,free,them,<END>
and,having,freed,them,they,didn't,want,to,have,anything,to,do,with,them,except,to,use,them,to,terrorize,southerners,<END>
they,didn't,like,them,didn't,trust,them,didn't,understand,them,and,yet,their,constant,cry,was,that,southerners,didn't,know,how,to,get,along,with,them,<END>
not,trust,a,darky,<END>
scarlett,trusted,them,far,more,than,most,white,people,certainly,more,than,she,trusted,any,yankee,<END>
there,were,qualities,of,loyalty,and,tirelessness,and,love,in,them,that,no,strain,could,break,no,money,could,buy,<END>
she,thought,of,the,faithful,few,who,remained,at,tara,in,the,face,of,the,yankee,invasion,when,they,could,have,fled,or,joined,the,troops,for,lives,of,leisure,<END>
but,they,had,stayed,<END>
she,thought,of,dilcey,toiling,in,the,cotton,fields,beside,her,of,pork,risking,his,life,in,neighboring,hen,houses,that,the,family,might,eat,of,mammy,coming,to,atlanta,with,her,to,keep,her,from,doing,wrong,<END>
she,thought,of,the,servants,of,her,neighbors,who,had,stood,loyally,beside,their,white,owners,protecting,their,mistresses,while,the,men,were,at,the,front,refugeeing,with,them,through,the,terrors,of,the,war,nursing,the,wounded,burying,the,dead,comforting,the,bereaved,working,begging,stealing,to,keep,food,on,the,tables,<END>
and,even,now,with,the,freedmen's,bureau,promising,all,manner,of,wonders,they,still,stuck,with,their,white,folks,and,worked,much,harder,than,they,ever,worked,in,slave,times,<END>

what,peter,said,was,true,but,she,hated,to,hear,it,from,a,negro,and,a,family,negro,too,<END>
not,to,stand,high,in,the,opinion,of,one's,servants,was,as,humiliating,a,thing,as,could,happen,to,a,southerner,<END>

that,was,as,accurate,a,summing,up,of,the,situation,as,could,be,made,and,scarlett,relapsed,into,infuriated,silence,<END>
yes,the,conquerors,did,approve,of,her,and,her,family,and,her,neighbors,did,not,<END>
she,knew,all,the,things,the,town,was,saying,about,her,<END>
and,now,even,peter,disapproved,of,her,to,the,point,of,not,caring,to,be,seen,in,public,with,her,<END>
that,was,the,last,straw,<END>
heretofore,she,had,been,careless,of,public,opinion,careless,and,a,little,contemptuous,<END>
but,peter's,words,caused,fierce,resentment,to,burn,in,her,breast,drove,her,to,a,defensive,position,made,her,suddenly,dislike,her,neighbors,as,much,as,she,disliked,the,yankees,<END>
why,should,they,care,what,i,do,<END>
she,thought,<END>
they,must,think,i,enjoy,associating,with,yankees,and,working,like,a,field,hand,<END>
they're,just,making,a,hard,job,harder,for,me,<END>
but,i,don't,care,what,they,think,<END>
i,won't,let,myself,care,<END>
i,can't,afford,to,care,now,<END>
but,some,day,some,day,<END>
oh,some,day,<END>
when,there,was,security,in,her,world,again,then,she,would,sit,back,and,fold,her,hands,and,be,a,great,lady,as,ellen,had,been,<END>
she,would,be,helpless,and,sheltered,as,a,lady,should,be,and,then,everyone,would,approve,of,her,<END>
oh,how,grand,she,would,be,when,she,had,money,again,<END>
then,she,could,permit,herself,to,be,kind,and,gentle,as,ellen,had,been,and,thoughtful,of,other,people,and,of,the,proprieties,to,<END>
she,would,not,be,driven,by,fears,day,and,night,and,life,would,be,a,placid,unhurried,affair,<END>
she,would,have,time,to,play,with,her,children,and,listen,to,their,lessons,<END>
there,would,be,long,warm,afternoons,when,ladies,would,call,and,amid,the,rustlings,of,taffeta,petticoats,and,the,rhythmic,harsh,cracklings,of,palmetto,fans,she,would,serve,tea,and,delicious,sandwiches,and,cakes,and,leisurely,gossip,the,hours,away,<END>
and,she,would,be,so,kind,to,those,who,were,suffering,misfortune,take,baskets,to,the,poor,and,soup,and,jelly,to,the,sick,and,air,those,less,fortunate,in,her,fine,carriage,<END>
she,would,be,a,lady,in,the,true,southern,manner,as,her,mother,had,been,<END>
and,then,everyone,would,love,her,as,they,had,loved,ellen,and,they,would,say,how,unselfish,she,was,and,call,her,lady,bountiful,<END>
her,pleasure,in,these,thoughts,of,the,future,was,undimmed,by,any,realization,that,she,had,no,real,desire,to,be,unselfish,or,charitable,or,kind,<END>
all,she,wanted,was,the,reputation,for,possessing,these,qualities,<END>
but,the,meshes,of,her,brain,were,too,wide,too,coarse,to,filter,such,small,differences,<END>
it,was,enough,that,some,day,when,she,had,money,everyone,would,approve,of,her,<END>
some,day,<END>
but,not,now,<END>
not,now,in,spite,of,what,anyone,might,say,of,her,<END>
now,there,was,no,time,to,be,a,great,lady,<END>
peter,was,as,good,as,his,word,<END>
aunt,pitty,did,get,into,a,state,and,peter's,misery,developed,overnight,to,such,proportions,that,he,never,drove,the,buggy,again,<END>
thereafter,scarlett,drove,alone,and,the,calluses,which,had,begun,to,leave,her,palms,came,back,again,<END>
so,the,spring,months,went,by,the,cool,rains,of,april,passing,into,the,warm,balm,of,green,may,weather,<END>
the,weeks,were,packed,with,work,and,worry,and,the,handicaps,of,increasing,pregnancy,with,old,friends,growing,cooler,and,her,family,increasingly,more,kind,more,maddeningly,solicitous,and,more,completely,blind,to,what,was,driving,her,<END>
during,those,days,of,anxiety,and,struggle,there,was,only,one,dependable,understanding,person,in,her,world,and,that,person,was,rhett,butler,<END>
it,was,odd,that,he,of,all,people,should,appear,in,this,light,for,he,was,as,unstable,as,quicksilver,and,as,perverse,as,a,demon,fresh,from,the,pit,<END>
but,he,gave,her,sympathy,something,she,had,never,had,from,anyone,and,never,expected,from,him,<END>
frequently,he,was,out,of,town,on,those,mysterious,trips,to,new,orleans,which,he,never,explained,but,which,she,felt,sure,in,a,faintly,jealous,way,were,connected,with,a,woman,or,women,<END>
but,after,uncle,peter's,refusal,to,drive,her,he,remained,in,atlanta,for,longer,and,longer,intervals,<END>
while,in,town,he,spent,most,of,his,time,gambling,in,the,rooms,above,the,girl,of,the,period,saloon,or,in,belle,watling's,bar,hobnobbing,with,the,wealthier,of,the,yankees,and,carpetbaggers,in,money-making,schemes,which,made,the,townspeople,detest,him,even,more,than,his,cronies,<END>
he,did,not,call,at,the,house,now,probably,in,deference,to,the,feelings,of,frank,and,pitty,who,would,have,been,outraged,at,a,male,caller,while,scarlett,was,in,a,delicate,condition,<END>
but,she,met,him,by,accident,almost,every,day,<END>
time,and,again,he,came,riding,up,to,her,buggy,when,she,was,passing,through,lonely,stretches,of,peachtree,road,and,decatur,road,where,the,mills,lay,<END>
he,always,drew,rein,and,talked,and,sometimes,he,tied,his,horse,to,the,back,of,the,buggy,and,drove,her,on,her,rounds,<END>
she,tired,more,easily,these,days,than,she,liked,to,admit,and,she,was,always,silently,grateful,when,he,took,the,reins,<END>
he,always,left,her,before,they,reached,the,town,again,but,all,atlanta,knew,about,their,meetings,and,it,gave,the,gossips,something,new,to,add,to,the,long,list,of,scarlett's,affronts,to,the,proprieties,<END>
she,wondered,occasionally,if,these,meetings,were,not,more,than,accidental,<END>
they,became,more,and,more,numerous,as,the,weeks,went,by,and,as,the,tension,in,town,heightened,over,negro,outrages,<END>
but,why,did,he,seek,her,out,now,of,all,times,when,she,looked,her,worst,<END>
certainly,he,had,no,designs,upon,her,if,he,had,ever,had,any,and,she,was,beginning,to,doubt,even,this,<END>
it,had,been,months,since,he,made,any,joking,references,to,their,distressing,scene,at,the,yankee,jail,<END>
he,never,mentioned,ashley,and,her,love,for,him,or,made,any,coarse,and,ill-bred,remarks,about,coveting,her,<END>
she,thought,it,best,to,let,sleeping,dogs,lie,so,she,did,not,ask,for,an,explanation,of,their,frequent,meetings,<END>
and,finally,she,decided,that,because,he,had,little,to,do,besides,gamble,and,had,few,enough,nice,friends,in,atlanta,he,sought,her,out,solely,for,companionship's,sake,<END>
whatever,his,reason,might,be,she,found,his,company,most,welcome,<END>
he,listened,to,her,moans,about,lost,customers,and,bad,debts,the,swindling,ways,of,mr,johnson,and,the,incompetency,of,hugh,<END>
he,applauded,her,triumphs,where,frank,merely,smiled,indulgently,and,pitty,said,dear,me,<END>
in,a,dazed,manner,<END>
she,was,sure,that,he,frequently,threw,business,her,way,for,he,knew,all,the,rich,yankees,and,carpetbaggers,intimately,but,he,always,denied,being,helpful,<END>
she,knew,him,for,what,he,was,and,she,never,trusted,him,but,her,spirits,always,rose,with,pleasure,at,the,sight,of,him,riding,around,the,curve,of,a,shady,road,on,his,big,black,horse,<END>
when,he,climbed,into,the,buggy,and,took,the,reins,from,her,and,threw,her,some,impertinent,remark,she,felt,young,and,gay,and,attractive,again,for,all,her,worries,and,her,increasing,bulk,<END>
she,could,talk,to,him,about,almost,everything,with,no,care,for,concealing,her,motives,or,her,real,opinions,and,she,never,ran,out,of,things,to,say,as,she,did,with,frank,or,even,with,ashley,if,she,must,be,honest,with,herself,<END>
but,of,course,in,all,her,conversations,with,ashley,there,were,so,many,things,which,could,not,be,said,for,honor's,sake,that,the,sheer,force,of,them,inhibited,other,remarks,<END>
it,was,comforting,to,have,a,friend,like,rhett,now,that,for,some,unaccountable,reason,he,had,decided,to,be,on,good,behavior,with,her,<END>
very,comforting,for,she,had,so,few,friends,these,days,<END>
rhett,she,asked,stormily,shortly,after,uncle,peter's,ultimatum,why,do,folks,in,this,town,treat,me,so,scurvily,and,talk,about,me,so,<END>
it's,a,toss-up,who,they,talk,worst,about,me,or,the,carpetbaggers,<END>
i've,minded,my,own,business,and,haven't,done,anything,wrong,and,<END>
if,you,haven't,done,anything,wrong,it's,because,you,haven't,had,the,opportunity,and,perhaps,they,dimly,realize,it,<END>
oh,do,be,serious,<END>
they,make,me,so,mad,<END>
all,i've,done,is,try,to,make,a,little,money,and,<END>
all,you've,done,is,to,be,different,from,other,women,and,you've,made,a,little,success,at,it,<END>
as,i've,told,you,before,that,is,the,one,unforgivable,sin,in,any,society,<END>
be,different,and,be,damned,<END>
scarlett,the,mere,fact,that,you've,made,a,success,of,your,mill,is,an,insult,to,every,man,who,hasn't,succeeded,<END>
remember,a,well-bred,female's,place,is,in,the,home,and,she,should,know,nothing,about,this,busy,brutal,world,<END>
but,if,i,had,stayed,in,my,home,i,wouldn't,have,had,any,home,left,to,stay,in,<END>
the,inference,is,that,you,should,have,starved,genteelly,and,with,pride,<END>
oh,fiddle-dee-dee,<END>
but,look,at,mrs,merriwether,<END>
she's,selling,pies,to,yankees,and,that's,worse,than,running,a,sawmill,and,mrs,elsing,takes,in,sewing,and,keeps,boarders,and,fanny,paints,awful-,looking,china,things,that,nobody,wants,and,everybody,buys,to,help,her,and,<END>
but,you,miss,the,point,my,pet,<END>
they,aren't,successful,and,so,they,aren't,affronting,the,hot,southern,pride,of,their,men,folks,<END>
the,men,can,still,say,'poor,sweet,sillies,how,hard,they,try,<END>
well,i'll,let,them,think,they're,helping,',<END>
and,besides,the,ladies,you,mentioned,don't,enjoy,having,to,work,<END>
they,let,it,be,known,that,they,are,only,doing,it,until,some,man,comes,along,to,relieve,them,of,their,unwomanly,burdens,<END>
and,so,everybody,feels,sorry,for,them,<END>
but,obviously,you,do,like,to,work,and,obviously,you,aren't,going,to,let,any,man,tend,to,your,business,for,you,and,so,no,one,can,feel,sorry,for,you,<END>
and,atlanta,is,never,going,to,forgive,you,for,that,<END>
it's,so,pleasant,to,feel,sorry,for,people,<END>
i,wish,you'd,be,serious,sometimes,<END>
did,you,ever,hear,the,oriental,proverb,'the,dogs,bark,but,the,caravan,passes,on,',<END>
let,them,bark,scarlett,<END>
i,fear,nothing,will,stop,your,caravan,<END>
but,why,should,they,mind,my,making,a,little,money,<END>
you,can't,have,everything,scarlett,<END>
you,can,either,make,money,in,your,present,unladylike,manner,and,meet,cold,shoulders,everywhere,you,go,or,you,can,be,poor,and,genteel,and,have,lots,of,friends,<END>
you've,made,your,choice,<END>
i,won't,be,poor,she,said,swiftly,<END>
but,it,is,the,right,choice,isn't,it,<END>
if,it's,money,you,want,most,<END>
yes,i,want,money,more,than,anything,else,in,the,world,<END>
then,you've,made,the,only,choice,<END>
but,there's,a,penalty,attached,as,there,is,to,most,things,you,want,<END>
it's,loneliness,<END>
that,silenced,her,for,a,moment,<END>
it,was,true,<END>
when,she,stopped,to,think,about,it,she,was,a,little,lonely,lonely,for,feminine,companionship,<END>
during,the,war,years,she,had,had,ellen,to,visit,when,she,felt,blue,<END>
and,since,ellen's,death,there,had,always,been,melanie,though,she,and,melanie,had,nothing,in,common,except,the,hard,work,at,tara,<END>
now,there,was,no,one,for,aunt,pitty,had,no,conception,of,life,beyond,her,small,round,of,gossip,<END>
i,think,i,think,she,began,hesitantly,that,i've,always,been,lonely,where,women,were,concerned,<END>
it,isn't,just,my,working,that,makes,atlanta,ladies,dislike,me,<END>
they,just,don't,like,me,anyway,<END>
no,woman,ever,really,liked,me,except,mother,<END>
even,my,sisters,<END>
i,don't,know,why,but,even,before,the,war,even,before,i,married,charlie,ladies,didn't,seem,to,approve,of,anything,i,did,<END>
you,forget,mrs,wilkes,said,rhett,and,his,eyes,gleamed,maliciously,<END>
she,has,always,approved,of,you,up,to,the,hilt,<END>
i,daresay,she'd,approve,of,anything,you,did,short,of,murder,<END>
scarlett,thought,grimly,she's,even,approved,of,murder,and,she,laughed,contemptuously,<END>
oh,melly,<END>
she,said,and,then,ruefully,it's,certainly,not,to,my,credit,that,melly,is,the,only,woman,who,approves,of,me,for,she,hasn't,the,sense,of,a,guinea,hen,<END>
if,she,had,any,sense,she,stopped,in,some,confusion,<END>
if,she,had,any,sense,she'd,realize,a,few,things,and,she,couldn't,approve,rhett,finished,<END>
well,you,know,more,about,that,than,i,do,of,course,<END>
oh,damn,your,memory,and,your,bad,manners,<END>
i'll,pass,over,your,unjustified,rudeness,with,the,silence,it,deserves,and,return,to,our,former,subject,<END>
make,up,your,mind,to,this,<END>
if,you,are,different,you,are,isolated,not,only,from,people,of,your,own,age,but,from,those,of,your,parents',generation,and,from,your,children's,generation,too,<END>
they'll,never,understand,you,and,they'll,be,shocked,no,matter,what,you,do,<END>
but,your,grandparents,would,probably,be,proud,of,you,and,say,'there's,a,chip,off,the,old,block,',and,your,grandchildren,will,sigh,enviously,and,say,'what,an,old,rip,grandma,must,have,been,',<END>
and,they'll,try,to,be,like,you,<END>
scarlett,laughed,with,amusement,<END>
sometimes,you,do,hit,on,the,truth,<END>
now,there,was,my,grandma,robillard,<END>
mammy,used,to,hold,her,over,my,head,whenever,i,was,naughty,<END>
grandma,was,as,cold,as,an,icicle,and,strict,about,her,manners,and,everybody,else's,manners,but,she,married,three,times,and,had,any,number,of,duels,fought,over,her,and,she,wore,rouge,and,the,most,shockingly,low-cut,dresses,and,no,well,er,not,much,under,her,dresses,<END>
and,you,admired,her,tremendously,for,all,that,you,tried,to,be,like,your,mother,<END>
i,had,a,grandfather,on,the,butler,side,who,was,a,pirate,<END>
not,really,<END>
a,walk-the-plank,kind,<END>
i,daresay,he,made,people,walk,the,plank,if,there,was,any,money,to,be,made,that,way,<END>
at,any,rate,he,made,enough,money,to,leave,my,father,quite,wealthy,<END>
but,the,family,always,referred,to,him,carefully,as,a,'sea,captain,',<END>

and,you,are,a,fool,if,you,are,crying,for,shame,<END>

now,that,we've,brought,this,dreadful,subject,into,the,light,and,you,admit,that,you,expect,a,baby,some,time,in,the,not,too,distant,future,i'll,say,something,i've,been,wanting,to,say,for,weeks,two,things,<END>
the,first,is,that,it's,dangerous,for,you,to,drive,alone,<END>

has,it,ever,occurred,to,you,that,perhaps,one,of,the,reasons,the,ladies,do,not,like,you,is,that,your,conduct,may,cause,the,neck-stretching,of,their,sons,and,husbands,<END>
and,furthermore,if,the,ku,klux,handles,many,more,negroes,the,yankees,are,going,to,tighten,up,on,atlanta,in,a,way,that,will,make,sherman's,conduct,look,angelic,<END>
i,know,what,i'm,talking,about,for,i'm,hand,in,glove,with,the,yankees,<END>
shameful,to,state,they,treat,me,as,one,of,them,and,i,hear,them,talk,openly,<END>
they,mean,to,stamp,out,the,ku,klux,if,it,means,burning,the,whole,town,again,and,hanging,every,male,over,ten,<END>

you,might,lose,money,<END>

i'm,a,renegade,a,turncoat,a,scallawag,<END>

yes,my,dear,it,is,my,much,advertised,chivalry,that,makes,me,protect,you,<END>
the,mocking,light,began,to,dance,in,his,black,eyes,and,all,signs,of,earnestness,fled,from,his,face,<END>
and,why,<END>
because,of,my,deep,love,for,you,mrs,kennedy,<END>
yes,i,have,silently,hungered,and,thirsted,for,you,and,worshipped,you,from,afar,but,being,an,honorable,man,like,mr,ashley,wilkes,i,have,concealed,it,from,you,<END>
you,are,alas,frank's,wife,and,honor,has,forbidden,my,telling,this,to,you,<END>

oh,for,god's,sake,hush,<END>
interrupted,scarlett,annoyed,as,usual,when,he,made,her,look,like,a,conceited,fool,and,not,caring,to,have,ashley,and,his,honor,become,the,subject,of,further,conversation,<END>
what,was,the,other,thing,you,wanted,to,tell,me,<END>
what,<END>
you,change,the,subject,when,i,am,baring,a,loving,but,lacerated,heart,<END>
well,the,other,thing,is,this,<END>
the,mocking,light,died,out,of,his,eyes,again,and,his,face,was,dark,and,quiet,<END>
i,want,you,to,do,something,about,this,horse,<END>
he's,stubborn,and,he's,got,a,mouth,as,tough,as,iron,<END>
tires,you,to,drive,him,doesn't,it,<END>
well,if,he,chose,to,bolt,you,couldn't,possibly,stop,him,<END>
and,if,you,turned,over,in,a,ditch,it,might,kill,your,baby,and,you,too,<END>
you,ought,to,get,the,heaviest,curb,bit,you,can,or,else,let,me,swap,him,for,a,gentle,horse,with,a,more,sensitive,mouth,<END>
she,looked,up,into,his,blank,smooth,face,and,suddenly,her,irritation,fell,away,even,as,her,embarrassment,had,disappeared,after,the,conversation,about,her,pregnancy,<END>
he,had,been,kind,a,few,moments,before,to,put,her,at,her,ease,when,she,was,wishing,that,she,were,dead,<END>
and,he,was,being,kinder,now,and,very,thoughtful,about,the,horse,<END>
she,felt,a,rush,of,gratitude,to,him,and,she,wondered,why,he,could,not,always,be,this,way,<END>
the,horse,is,hard,to,drive,she,agreed,meekly,<END>
sometimes,my,arms,ache,all,night,from,tugging,at,him,<END>
you,do,what,you,think,best,about,him,rhett,<END>
his,eyes,sparkled,wickedly,<END>
that,sounds,very,sweet,and,feminine,mrs,kennedy,<END>
not,in,your,usual,masterful,vein,at,all,<END>
well,it,only,takes,proper,handling,to,make,a,clinging,vine,out,of,you,<END>
she,scowled,and,her,temper,came,back,<END>
you,will,get,out,of,this,buggy,this,time,or,i,will,hit,you,with,the,whip,<END>
i,don't,know,why,i,put,up,with,you,why,i,try,to,be,nice,to,you,<END>
you,have,no,manners,<END>
you,have,no,morals,<END>
you,are,nothing,but,a,well,get,out,<END>
i,mean,it,<END>
but,when,he,had,climbed,down,and,untied,his,horse,from,the,back,of,the,buggy,and,stood,in,the,twilight,road,grinning,tantalizingly,at,her,she,could,not,smother,her,own,grin,as,she,drove,off,<END>
yes,he,was,coarse,he,was,tricky,he,was,unsafe,to,have,dealings,with,and,you,never,could,tell,when,the,dull,weapon,you,put,into,his,hands,in,an,unguarded,moment,might,turn,into,the,keenest,of,blades,<END>
but,after,all,he,was,as,stimulating,as,well,as,a,surreptitious,glass,of,brandy,<END>
during,these,months,scarlett,had,learned,the,use,of,brandy,<END>
when,she,came,home,in,the,late,afternoons,damp,from,the,rain,cramped,and,aching,from,long,hours,in,the,buggy,nothing,sustained,her,except,the,thought,of,the,bottle,hidden,in,her,top,bureau,drawer,locked,against,mammy's,prying,eyes,<END>
dr,meade,had,not,thought,to,warn,her,that,a,woman,in,her,condition,should,not,drink,for,it,never,occurred,to,him,that,a,decent,woman,would,drink,anything,stronger,than,scuppernong,wine,<END>
except,of,course,a,glass,of,champagne,at,a,wedding,or,a,hot,toddy,when,confined,to,bed,with,a,hard,cold,<END>

but,as,much,as,the,doctor,disapproved,of,scarlett,he,never,suspected,her,of,drinking,<END>
scarlett,had,found,that,a,drink,of,neat,brandy,before,supper,helped,immeasurably,and,she,would,always,chew,coffee,or,gargle,cologne,to,disguise,the,smell,<END>
why,were,people,so,silly,about,women,drinking,when,men,could,and,did,get,reeling,drunk,whenever,they,wanted,to,<END>
sometimes,when,frank,lay,snoring,beside,her,and,sleep,would,not,come,when,she,lay,tossing,torn,with,fears,of,poverty,dreading,the,yankees,homesick,for,tara,and,yearning,for,ashley,she,thought,she,would,go,crazy,were,it,not,for,the,brandy,bottle,<END>
and,when,the,pleasant,familiar,warmth,stole,through,her,veins,her,troubles,began,to,fade,<END>
after,three,drinks,she,could,always,say,to,herself,i'll,think,of,these,things,tomorrow,when,i,can,stand,them,better,<END>
but,there,were,some,nights,when,even,brandy,would,not,still,the,ache,in,her,heart,the,ache,that,was,even,stronger,than,fear,of,losing,the,mills,the,ache,to,see,tara,again,<END>
atlanta,with,its,noises,its,new,buildings,its,strange,faces,its,narrow,streets,crowded,with,horses,and,wagons,and,bustling,crowds,sometimes,seemed,to,stifle,her,<END>

the,train,was,very,late,and,the,long,deeply,blue,twilight,of,june,was,settling,over,the,countryside,when,scarlett,alighted,in,jonesboro,<END>
yellow,gleams,of,lamplight,showed,in,the,stores,and,houses,which,remained,in,the,village,but,they,were,few,<END>
here,and,there,were,wide,gaps,between,the,buildings,on,the,main,street,where,dwellings,had,been,shelled,or,burned,<END>
ruined,houses,with,shell,holes,in,their,roofs,and,half,the,walls,torn,away,stared,at,her,silent,and,dark,<END>
a,few,saddle,horses,and,mule,teams,were,hitched,outside,the,wooden,awning,of,bullard's,store,<END>
the,dusty,red,road,was,empty,and,lifeless,and,the,only,sounds,in,the,village,were,a,few,whoops,and,drunken,laughs,that,floated,on,the,still,twilight,air,from,a,saloon,far,down,the,street,<END>

he,should,have,known,she,would,take,the,first,train,possible,after,receiving,his,laconic,message,that,gerald,was,dead,<END>
she,had,come,so,hurriedly,that,she,had,in,her,small,carpetbag,only,a,nightgown,and,a,tooth,brush,not,even,a,change,of,underwear,<END>

her,figure,was,completely,gone,and,her,face,and,ankles,were,puffy,<END>

she,patted,her,foot,impatiently,<END>

where,was,he,<END>
then,she,heard,the,scrunching,of,cinders,on,the,railroad,tracks,behind,her,and,twisting,her,body,she,saw,alex,fontaine,crossing,the,tracks,toward,a,wagon,a,sack,of,oats,on,his,shoulder,<END>

if,it's,any,comfort,to,you,scarlett,we're,mighty,proud,of,him,around,here,alex,continued,dropping,her,hand,<END>
he,well,we,figure,he,died,like,a,soldier,and,in,a,soldier's,cause,<END>
now,what,did,he,mean,by,that,she,thought,confusedly,<END>
a,soldier,<END>
had,someone,shot,him,<END>
had,he,gotten,into,a,fight,with,the,scallawags,as,tony,had,<END>
but,she,mustn't,hear,more,<END>
she,would,cry,if,she,talked,about,him,and,she,mustn't,cry,not,until,she,was,safely,in,the,wagon,with,will,and,out,in,the,country,where,no,stranger,could,see,her,<END>
will,wouldn't,matter,<END>
he,was,just,like,a,brother,<END>
alex,i,don't,want,to,talk,about,it,she,said,shortly,<END>
i,don't,blame,you,one,bit,scarlett,said,alex,while,the,dark,blood,of,anger,flooded,his,face,<END>
if,it,was,my,sister,i'd,well,scarlett,i've,never,yet,said,a,harsh,word,about,any,woman,but,personally,i,think,somebody,ought,to,take,a,rawhide,whip,to,suellen,<END>
what,foolishness,was,he,talking,about,now,she,wondered,<END>
what,had,suellen,to,do,with,it,all,<END>
everybody,around,here,feels,the,same,way,about,her,i'm,sorry,to,say,<END>
will's,the,only,one,who,takes,up,for,her,and,of,course,miss,melanie,but,she's,a,saint,and,won't,see,bad,in,anyone,and,<END>
i,said,i,didn't,want,to,talk,about,it,she,said,coldly,but,alex,did,not,seem,rebuffed,<END>
he,looked,as,though,he,understood,her,rudeness,and,that,was,annoying,<END>
she,didn't,want,to,hear,bad,tidings,about,her,own,family,from,an,outsider,didn't,want,him,to,know,of,her,ignorance,of,what,had,happened,<END>
why,hadn't,will,sent,her,the,full,details,<END>
she,wished,alex,wouldn't,look,at,her,so,hard,<END>
she,felt,that,he,realized,her,condition,and,it,embarrassed,her,<END>
but,what,alex,was,thinking,as,he,peered,at,her,in,the,twilight,was,that,her,face,had,changed,so,completely,he,wondered,how,he,had,ever,recognized,her,<END>
perhaps,it,was,because,she,was,going,to,have,a,baby,<END>
women,did,look,like,the,devil,at,such,times,<END>
and,of,course,she,must,be,feeling,badly,about,old,man,o'hara,<END>
she,had,been,his,pet,<END>
but,no,the,change,was,deeper,than,that,<END>
she,really,looked,as,if,she,had,three,square,meals,a,day,<END>
and,the,hunted-animal,look,had,partly,gone,from,her,eyes,<END>
now,the,eyes,which,had,been,fearful,and,desperate,were,hard,<END>
there,was,an,air,of,command,assurance,and,determination,about,her,even,when,she,smiled,<END>
bet,she,led,old,frank,a,merry,life,<END>
yes,she,had,changed,<END>
she,was,a,handsome,woman,to,be,sure,but,all,that,pretty,sweet,softness,had,gone,from,her,face,and,that,flattering,way,of,looking,up,at,a,man,like,he,knew,more,than,god,almighty,had,utterly,vanished,<END>
well,hadn't,they,all,changed,<END>
alex,looked,down,at,his,rough,clothes,and,his,face,fell,into,its,usual,bitter,lines,<END>
sometimes,at,night,when,he,lay,awake,wondering,how,his,mother,was,going,to,get,that,operation,and,how,poor,dead,joe's,little,boy,was,going,to,get,an,education,and,how,he,was,going,to,get,money,for,another,mule,he,wished,the,war,was,still,going,on,wished,it,had,gone,on,forever,<END>
they,didn't,know,their,luck,then,<END>
there,was,always,something,to,eat,in,the,army,even,if,it,was,just,corn,bread,always,somebody,to,give,orders,and,none,of,this,torturing,sense,of,facing,problems,that,couldn't,be,solved,nothing,to,bother,about,in,the,army,except,getting,killed,<END>
and,then,there,was,dimity,munroe,<END>
alex,wanted,to,marry,her,and,he,knew,he,couldn't,when,so,many,were,already,looking,to,him,for,support,<END>
he,had,loved,her,for,so,long,and,now,the,roses,were,fading,from,her,cheeks,and,the,joy,from,her,eyes,<END>
if,only,tony,hadn't,had,to,run,away,to,texas,<END>
another,man,on,the,place,would,make,all,the,difference,in,the,world,<END>
his,lovable,bad-tempered,little,brother,penniless,somewhere,in,the,west,<END>
yes,they,had,all,changed,<END>
and,why,not,<END>
he,sighed,heavily,<END>
i,haven't,thanked,you,for,what,you,and,frank,did,for,tony,he,said,<END>
it,was,you,who,helped,him,get,away,wasn't,it,<END>
it,was,fine,of,you,<END>
i,heard,in,a,roundabout,way,that,he,was,safe,in,texas,<END>
i,was,afraid,to,write,and,ask,you,but,did,you,or,frank,lend,him,any,money,<END>
i,want,to,repay,<END>
oh,alex,please,hush,<END>
not,now,<END>
cried,scarlett,<END>
for,once,money,meant,nothing,to,her,<END>
alex,was,silent,for,a,moment,<END>
i'll,get,will,for,you,he,said,and,we'll,all,be,over,tomorrow,for,the,funeral,<END>
as,he,picked,up,the,sack,of,oats,and,turned,away,a,wobbly-wheeled,wagon,swayed,out,of,a,side,street,and,creaked,up,to,them,<END>
will,called,from,the,seat,i'm,sorry,i'm,late,scarlett,<END>
climbing,awkwardly,down,from,the,wagon,he,stumped,toward,her,and,bending,kissed,her,cheek,<END>
will,had,never,kissed,her,before,had,never,failed,to,precede,her,name,with,miss,and,while,it,surprised,her,it,warmed,her,heart,and,pleased,her,very,much,<END>
he,lifted,her,carefully,over,the,wheel,and,into,the,wagon,and,looking,down,she,saw,that,it,was,the,same,old,rickety,wagon,in,which,she,had,fled,from,atlanta,<END>
how,had,it,ever,held,together,so,long,<END>
will,must,have,kept,it,patched,up,very,well,<END>
it,made,her,slightly,sick,to,look,at,it,and,to,remember,that,night,<END>
if,it,took,the,shoes,off,her,feet,or,food,from,aunt,pitty's,table,she'd,see,that,there,was,a,new,wagon,at,tara,and,this,one,burned,<END>
will,did,not,speak,at,first,and,scarlett,was,grateful,<END>
he,threw,his,battered,straw,hat,into,the,back,of,the,wagon,clucked,to,the,horse,and,they,moved,off,<END>
will,was,just,the,same,lank,and,gangling,pink,of,hair,mild,of,eye,patient,as,a,draft,animal,<END>
they,left,the,village,behind,and,turned,into,the,red,road,to,tara,<END>
a,faint,pink,still,lingered,about,the,edges,of,the,sky,and,fat,feathery,clouds,were,tinged,with,gold,and,palest,green,<END>
the,stillness,of,the,country,twilight,came,down,about,them,as,calming,as,a,prayer,<END>
how,had,she,ever,borne,it,she,thought,away,for,all,these,months,away,from,the,fresh,smell,of,country,air,the,plowed,earth,and,the,sweetness,of,summer,nights,<END>
the,moist,red,earth,smelled,so,good,so,familiar,so,friendly,she,wanted,to,get,out,and,scoop,up,a,handful,<END>
the,honeysuckle,which,draped,the,gullied,red,sides,of,the,road,in,tangled,greenery,was,piercingly,fragrant,as,always,after,rain,the,sweetest,perfume,in,the,world,<END>
above,their,heads,a,flock,of,chimney,swallows,whirled,suddenly,on,swift,wings,and,now,and,then,a,rabbit,scurried,startled,across,the,road,his,white,tail,bobbing,like,an,eiderdown,powder,puff,<END>
she,saw,with,pleasure,that,the,cotton,stood,well,as,they,passed,between,plowed,fields,where,the,green,bushes,reared,themselves,sturdily,out,of,the,red,earth,<END>
how,beautiful,all,this,was,<END>
the,soft,gray,mist,in,the,swampy,bottoms,the,red,earth,and,growing,cotton,the,sloping,fields,with,curving,green,rows,and,the,black,pines,rising,behind,everything,like,sable,walls,<END>
how,had,she,ever,stayed,in,atlanta,so,long,<END>
scarlett,before,i,tell,you,about,mr,o'hara,and,i,want,to,tell,you,everything,before,you,get,home,i,want,to,ask,your,opinion,on,a,matter,<END>
i,figger,you're,the,head,of,the,house,now,<END>
what,is,it,will,<END>
he,turned,his,mild,sober,gaze,on,her,for,a,moment,<END>
i,just,wanted,your,approval,to,my,marryin',suellen,<END>
scarlett,clutched,the,seat,so,surprised,that,she,almost,fell,backwards,<END>
marry,suellen,<END>
she'd,never,thought,of,anybody,marrying,suellen,since,she,had,taken,frank,kennedy,from,her,<END>
who,would,have,suellen,<END>
goodness,will,<END>
then,i,take,it,you,don't,mind,<END>
mind,<END>
no,but,why,will,you've,taken,my,breath,away,<END>
you,marry,suellen,<END>
will,i,always,thought,you,were,sweet,on,carreen,<END>
will,kept,his,eyes,on,the,horse,and,flapped,the,reins,<END>
his,profile,did,not,change,but,she,thought,he,sighed,slightly,<END>
maybe,i,was,he,said,<END>
well,won't,she,have,you,<END>
i,never,asked,her,<END>
oh,will,you're,a,fool,<END>
ask,her,<END>
she's,worth,two,of,suellen,<END>
scarlett,you,don't,know,a,lot,of,things,that's,been,going,on,at,tara,<END>
you,ain't,favored,us,with,much,of,your,attention,these,last,months,<END>
i,haven't,haven't,i,<END>
she,flared,<END>
what,do,you,suppose,i've,been,doing,in,atlanta,<END>
riding,around,in,a,coach,and,four,and,going,to,balls,<END>
haven't,i,sent,you,money,every,month,<END>
haven't,i,paid,the,taxes,and,fixed,the,roof,and,bought,the,new,plow,and,the,mules,<END>
haven't,<END>
now,don't,fly,off,the,handle,and,get,your,irish,up,he,interrupted,imperturbably,<END>
if,anybody,knows,what,you've,done,i,do,and,it's,been,two,men's,work,<END>
slightly,mollified,she,questioned,well,then,what,do,you,mean,<END>
well,you've,kept,the,roof,over,us,and,food,in,the,pantry,and,i,ain't,denyin',that,but,you,ain't,given,much,thought,to,what's,been,goin',on,in,anybody's,head,here,at,tara,<END>
i,ain't,blamin',you,scarlett,<END>
that's,just,your,way,<END>
you,warn't,never,very,much,interested,in,what,was,in,folks',heads,<END>
but,what,i'm,tryin',to,tell,you,is,that,i,didn't,never,ask,miss,carreen,because,i,knew,it,wouldn't,be,no,use,<END>
she's,been,like,a,little,sister,to,me,and,i,guess,she,talks,to,me,plainer,than,to,anybody,in,the,world,<END>
but,she,never,got,over,that,dead,boy,and,she,never,will,<END>
and,i,might,as,well,tell,you,now,she's,aimin',to,go,in,a,convent,over,to,charleston,<END>
are,you,joking,<END>
well,i,knew,it,would,take,you,back,and,i,just,want,to,ask,you,scarlett,don't,you,argue,with,her,about,it,or,scold,her,or,laugh,at,her,<END>
let,her,go,<END>
it's,all,she,wants,now,<END>
her,heart's,broken,<END>
but,god's,nightgown,<END>
lots,of,people's,hearts,have,been,broken,and,they,didn't,run,off,to,convents,<END>
look,at,me,<END>
i,lost,a,husband,<END>
but,your,heart,warn't,broken,will,said,calmly,and,picking,up,a,straw,from,the,bottom,of,the,wagon,he,put,it,in,his,mouth,and,chewed,slowly,<END>
that,remark,took,the,wind,out,of,her,<END>
as,always,when,she,heard,the,truth,spoken,no,matter,how,unpalatable,it,was,basic,honesty,forced,her,to,acknowledge,it,as,truth,<END>
she,was,silent,a,moment,trying,to,accustom,herself,to,the,idea,of,carreen,as,a,nun,<END>
promise,you,won't,fuss,at,her,<END>
oh,well,i,promise,and,then,she,looked,at,him,with,a,new,understanding,and,some,amazement,<END>
will,had,loved,carreen,loved,her,now,enough,to,take,her,part,and,make,her,retreat,easy,<END>
and,yet,he,wanted,to,marry,suellen,<END>
well,what's,all,this,about,suellen,<END>
you,don't,care,for,her,do,you,<END>
oh,yes,i,do,in,a,way,he,said,removing,the,straw,and,surveying,it,as,if,it,were,highly,interesting,<END>
suellen,ain't,as,bad,as,you,think,scarlett,<END>
i,think,we'll,get,along,right,well,<END>
the,only,trouble,with,suellen,is,that,she,needs,a,husband,and,some,children,and,that's,just,what,every,woman,needs,<END>
the,wagon,jolted,over,the,rutty,road,and,for,a,few,minutes,while,the,two,sat,silent,scarlett's,mind,was,busy,<END>
there,must,be,something,more,to,it,than,appeared,on,the,surface,something,deeper,more,important,to,make,the,mild,and,soft-spoken,will,want,to,marry,a,complaining,nagger,like,suellen,<END>
you,haven't,told,me,the,real,reason,will,<END>
if,i'm,head,of,the,family,i've,got,a,right,to,know,<END>
that's,right,said,will,and,i,guess,you'll,understand,<END>
i,can't,leave,tara,<END>
it's,home,to,me,scarlett,the,only,real,home,i,ever,knew,and,i,love,every,stone,of,it,<END>
i've,worked,on,it,like,it,was,mine,<END>
and,when,you,put,out,work,on,somethin',you,come,to,love,it,<END>
you,know,what,i,mean,<END>
she,knew,what,he,meant,and,her,heart,went,out,in,a,surge,of,warm,affection,for,him,hearing,him,say,he,too,loved,the,thing,she,loved,best,<END>
and,i,figger,it,this,way,<END>
with,your,pa,gone,and,carreen,a,nun,there'll,be,just,me,and,suellen,left,here,and,of,course,i,couldn't,live,on,at,tara,without,marryin',suellen,<END>
you,know,how,folks,talk,<END>
but,but,will,there's,melanie,and,ashley,<END>
at,ashley's,name,he,turned,and,looked,at,her,his,pale,eyes,unfathomable,<END>
she,had,the,old,feeling,that,will,knew,all,about,her,and,ashley,understood,all,and,did,not,either,censure,or,approve,<END>
they'll,be,goin',soon,<END>
going,<END>
where,<END>
tara,is,their,home,as,well,as,yours,<END>
no,it,ain't,their,home,<END>
that's,just,what's,eatin',on,ashley,<END>
it,ain't,his,home,and,he,don't,feel,like,he's,earnin',his,keep,<END>
he's,a,mighty,pore,farmer,and,he,knows,it,<END>
god,knows,he,tries,his,best,but,he,warn't,cut,out,for,farmin',and,you,know,it,as,well,as,i,do,<END>
if,he,splits,kindlin',like,as,not,he'll,slice,off,his,foot,<END>
he,can't,no,more,keep,a,plow,straight,in,a,furrow,than,little,beau,can,and,what,he,don't,know,about,makin',things,grow,would,fill,a,book,<END>
it,ain't,his,fault,<END>
he,just,warn't,bred,for,it,<END>
and,it,worries,him,that,he's,a,man,livin',at,tara,on,a,woman's,charity,and,not,givin',much,in,return,<END>
charity,<END>
has,he,ever,said,<END>
no,he's,never,said,a,word,<END>
you,know,ashley,<END>
but,i,can,tell,<END>
last,night,when,we,were,sittin',up,with,your,pa,i,tole,him,i,had,asked,suellen,and,she'd,said,yes,<END>
and,then,ashley,said,that,relieved,him,because,he'd,been,feelin',like,a,dog,stayin',on,at,tara,and,he,knew,he,and,miss,melly,would,have,to,keep,stayin',on,now,that,mr,o'hara,was,dead,just,to,keep,folks,from,talkin',about,me,and,suellen,<END>
so,then,he,told,me,he,was,aimin',to,leave,tara,and,get,work,<END>
work,<END>
what,kind,<END>
where,<END>
i,don't,know,exactly,what,he'll,do,but,he,said,he,was,goin',up,north,<END>
he's,got,a,yankee,friend,in,new,york,who,wrote,him,about,workin',in,a,bank,up,there,<END>
oh,no,<END>
cried,scarlett,from,the,bottom,of,her,heart,and,at,the,cry,will,gave,her,the,same,look,as,before,<END>
maybe,'twould,be,better,all,'round,if,he,did,go,north,<END>
no,<END>
no,<END>
i,don't,think,so,<END>
her,mind,was,working,feverishly,<END>
ashley,couldn't,go,north,<END>
she,might,never,see,him,again,<END>
even,though,she,had,not,seen,him,in,months,had,not,spoken,to,him,alone,since,that,fateful,scene,in,the,orchard,there,had,not,been,a,day,when,she,had,not,thought,of,him,been,glad,he,was,sheltered,under,her,roof,<END>
she,had,never,sent,a,dollar,to,will,that,she,had,not,been,pleased,that,it,would,make,ashley's,life,easier,<END>
of,course,he,wasn't,any,good,as,a,farmer,<END>
ashley,was,bred,for,better,things,she,thought,proudly,<END>
he,was,born,to,rule,to,live,in,a,large,house,ride,fine,horses,read,books,of,poetry,and,tell,negroes,what,to,do,<END>
that,there,were,no,more,mansions,and,horses,and,negroes,and,few,books,did,not,alter,matters,<END>
ashley,wasn't,bred,to,plow,and,split,rails,<END>
no,wonder,he,wanted,to,leave,tara,<END>
but,she,could,not,let,him,go,away,from,georgia,<END>
if,necessary,she,would,bully,frank,into,giving,him,a,job,in,the,store,make,frank,turn,off,the,boy,he,now,had,behind,the,counter,<END>
but,no,ashley's,place,was,no,more,behind,a,counter,than,it,was,behind,a,plow,<END>
a,wilkes,a,shopkeeper,<END>
oh,never,that,<END>
there,must,be,something,why,her,mill,of,course,<END>
her,relief,at,the,thought,was,so,great,that,she,smiled,<END>
but,would,he,accept,an,offer,from,her,<END>
would,he,still,think,it,was,charity,<END>
she,must,manage,it,so,he,would,think,he,was,doing,her,a,favor,<END>
she,would,discharge,mr,johnson,and,put,ashley,in,charge,of,the,old,mill,while,hugh,operated,the,new,one,<END>
she,would,explain,to,ashley,how,frank's,ill,health,and,the,pressure,of,work,at,the,store,kept,him,from,helping,her,and,she,would,plead,her,condition,as,another,reason,why,she,needed,his,help,<END>
she,would,make,him,realize,somehow,that,she,couldn't,do,without,his,aid,at,this,time,<END>
and,she,would,give,him,a,half-interest,in,the,mill,if,he,would,only,take,it,over,anything,just,to,have,him,near,her,anything,to,see,that,bright,smile,light,up,his,face,anything,for,the,chance,of,catching,an,unguarded,look,in,his,eyes,that,showed,he,still,cared,<END>
but,she,promised,herself,never,never,would,she,again,try,to,prod,him,into,words,of,love,never,again,would,she,try,to,make,him,throw,away,that,foolish,honor,he,valued,more,than,love,<END>
somehow,she,must,delicately,convey,to,him,this,new,resolution,of,hers,<END>
otherwise,he,might,refuse,fearing,another,scene,such,as,that,last,terrible,one,had,been,<END>
i,can,get,him,something,to,do,in,atlanta,she,said,<END>
well,that's,yours,and,ashley's,business,said,will,and,put,the,straw,back,in,his,mouth,<END>
giddap,sherman,<END>
now,scarlett,<END>
there's,somethin',else,i've,got,to,ask,you,before,i,tell,you,about,your,pa,i,won't,have,you,lightin',into,suellen,<END>
what,she's,done,she's,done,and,you,snatchin',her,baldheaded,won't,bring,mr,o'hara,back,<END>
besides,she,honestly,thought,she,was,actin',for,the,best,<END>
i,wanted,to,ask,you,about,that,<END>
what,is,all,this,about,suellen,<END>
alex,talked,riddles,and,said,she,ought,to,be,whipped,<END>
what,has,she,done,<END>
yes,folks,are,pretty,riled,up,about,her,<END>
everybody,i,run,into,this,afternoon,in,jonesboro,was,promisin',to,cut,her,dead,the,next,time,they,seen,her,but,maybe,they'll,get,over,it,<END>
now,promise,me,you,won't,light,into,her,<END>
i,won't,be,havin',no,quarrelin',tonight,with,mr,o'hara,layin',dead,in,the,parlor,<END>
he,won't,be,having,any,quarreling,<END>
thought,scarlett,indignantly,<END>
he,talks,like,tara,was,his,already,<END>
and,then,she,thought,of,gerald,dead,in,the,parlor,and,suddenly,she,began,to,cry,cry,in,bitter,gulping,sobs,<END>
will,put,his,arm,around,her,drew,her,comfortably,close,and,said,nothing,<END>

ashley,leaning,against,the,old,secretary,knew,that,the,responsibility,for,preventing,trouble,lay,with,him,and,knowing,the,hair-trigger,tempers,of,the,county,was,at,a,loss,as,to,how,to,proceed,<END>

the,swamp,men,were,lean,bearded,giants,in,homespun,coon-skin,caps,on,their,heads,their,rifles,easy,in,the,crooks,of,their,arms,their,wads,of,tobacco,stilled,in,their,cheeks,<END>

good,lord,<END>
what,a,comedown,<END>
she,shuddered,turning,her,eyes,from,cathleen,as,she,realized,how,narrow,was,the,chasm,between,quality,folk,and,poor,whites,<END>
there,but,for,a,lot,of,gumption,am,i,she,thought,and,pride,surged,through,her,as,she,realized,that,she,and,cathleen,had,started,with,the,same,equipment,after,the,surrender,empty,hands,and,what,they,had,in,their,heads,<END>
i,haven't,done,so,bad,she,thought,lifting,her,chin,and,smiling,<END>
but,she,stopped,in,mid-smile,as,she,saw,the,scandalized,eyes,of,mrs,tarleton,upon,her,<END>
her,eyes,were,red-rimmed,from,tears,and,after,giving,scarlett,a,reproving,look,she,turned,her,gaze,back,to,suellen,a,fierce,angry,gaze,that,boded,ill,for,her,<END>
behind,her,and,her,husband,were,the,four,tarleton,girls,their,red,locks,indecorous,notes,in,the,solemn,occasion,their,russet,eyes,still,looking,like,the,eyes,of,vital,young,animals,spirited,and,dangerous,<END>
feet,were,stilled,hats,were,removed,hands,folded,and,skirts,rustled,into,quietness,as,ashley,stepped,forward,with,carreen's,worn,book,of,devotions,in,his,hand,<END>
he,stood,for,a,moment,looking,down,the,sun,glittering,on,his,golden,head,<END>
a,deep,silence,fell,on,the,crowd,so,deep,that,the,harsh,whisper,of,the,wind,in,the,magnolia,leaves,came,clear,to,their,ears,and,the,far-off,repetitious,note,of,a,mockingbird,sounded,unendurably,loud,and,sad,<END>
ashley,began,to,read,the,prayers,and,all,heads,bowed,as,his,resonant,beautifully,modulated,voice,rolled,out,the,brief,and,dignified,words,<END>
oh,<END>
thought,scarlett,her,throat,constricting,<END>
how,beautiful,his,voice,is,<END>
if,anyone,has,to,do,this,for,pa,i'm,glad,it's,ashley,<END>
i'd,rather,have,him,than,a,priest,<END>
i'd,rather,have,pa,buried,by,one,of,his,own,folks,than,a,stranger,<END>
when,ashley,came,to,the,part,of,the,prayers,concerning,the,souls,in,purgatory,which,carreen,had,marked,for,him,to,read,he,abruptly,closed,the,book,<END>
only,carreen,noticed,the,omission,and,looked,up,puzzled,as,he,began,the,lord's,prayer,<END>
ashley,knew,that,half,the,people,present,had,never,heard,of,purgatory,and,those,who,had,would,take,it,as,a,personal,affront,if,he,insinuated,even,in,prayer,that,so,fine,a,man,as,mr,o'hara,had,not,gone,straight,to,heaven,<END>
so,in,deference,to,public,opinion,he,skipped,all,mention,of,purgatory,<END>
the,gathering,joined,heartily,in,the,lord's,prayer,but,their,voices,trailed,off,into,embarrassed,silence,when,he,began,the,hail,mary,<END>
they,had,never,heard,that,prayer,and,they,looked,furtively,at,each,other,as,the,o'hara,girls,melanie,and,the,tara,servants,gave,the,response,pray,for,us,now,and,at,the,hour,of,our,death,<END>
amen,<END>
then,ashley,raised,his,head,and,stood,for,a,moment,uncertain,<END>
the,eyes,of,the,neighbors,were,expectantly,upon,him,as,they,settled,themselves,in,easier,positions,for,a,long,harangue,<END>
they,were,waiting,for,him,to,go,on,with,the,service,for,it,did,not,occur,to,any,of,them,that,he,was,at,the,end,of,the,catholic,prayers,<END>
county,funerals,were,always,long,<END>
the,baptist,and,methodist,ministers,who,performed,them,had,no,set,prayers,but,extemporized,as,the,circumstances,demanded,and,seldom,stopped,before,all,mourners,were,in,tears,and,the,bereaved,feminine,relatives,screaming,with,grief,<END>
the,neighbors,would,have,been,shocked,aggrieved,and,indignant,had,these,brief,prayers,been,all,the,service,over,the,body,of,their,loved,friend,and,no,one,knew,this,better,than,ashley,<END>
the,matter,would,be,discussed,at,dinner,tables,for,weeks,and,the,opinion,of,the,county,would,be,that,the,o'hara,girls,had,not,shown,proper,respect,for,their,father,<END>
so,he,threw,a,quick,apologetic,glance,at,carreen,and,bowing,his,head,again,began,reciting,from,memory,the,episcopal,burial,service,which,he,had,often,read,over,slaves,buried,at,twelve,oaks,<END>
i,am,the,resurrection,and,the,life,<END>
and,whosoever,<END>
believeth,in,me,shall,never,die,<END>
it,did,not,come,back,to,him,readily,and,he,spoke,slowly,occasionally,falling,silent,for,a,space,as,he,waited,for,phrases,to,rise,from,his,memory,<END>
but,this,measured,delivery,made,his,words,more,impressive,and,mourners,who,had,been,dry-eyed,before,began,now,to,reach,for,handkerchiefs,<END>
sturdy,baptists,and,methodists,all,they,thought,it,the,catholic,ceremony,and,immediately,rearranged,their,first,opinion,that,the,catholic,services,were,cold,and,popish,<END>
scarlett,and,suellen,were,equally,ignorant,and,thought,the,words,comforting,and,beautiful,<END>
only,melanie,and,carreen,realized,that,a,devoutly,catholic,irishman,was,being,laid,to,rest,by,the,church,of,england's,service,<END>
and,carreen,was,too,stunned,by,grief,and,her,hurt,at,ashley's,treachery,to,interfere,<END>
when,he,had,finished,ashley,opened,wide,his,sad,gray,eyes,and,looked,about,the,crowd,<END>
after,a,pause,his,eyes,caught,those,of,will,and,he,said,is,there,anyone,present,who,would,like,to,say,a,word,<END>
mrs,tarleton,twitched,nervously,but,before,she,could,act,will,stumped,forward,and,standing,at,the,head,of,the,coffin,began,to,speak,<END>
friends,he,began,in,his,flat,voice,maybe,you,think,i'm,gettin',above,myself,speakin',first,me,who,never,knew,mr,o'hara,till,'bout,a,year,ago,when,you,all,have,known,him,twenty,years,or,more,<END>
but,this,here,is,my,excuse,<END>
if,he'd,lived,a,month,or,so,longer,i'd,have,had,the,right,to,call,him,pa,<END>
a,startled,ripple,went,over,the,crowd,<END>
they,were,too,well,bred,to,whisper,but,they,shifted,on,their,feet,and,stared,at,carreen's,bowed,head,<END>
everyone,knew,his,dumb,devotion,to,her,<END>
seeing,the,direction,in,which,all,eyes,were,cast,will,went,on,as,if,he,had,taken,no,note,<END>
so,bein',as,how,i'm,to,marry,miss,suellen,as,soon,as,the,priest,comes,down,from,atlanta,i,thought,maybe,that,gives,me,the,right,to,speak,first,<END>
the,last,part,of,his,speech,was,lost,in,a,faint,sibilant,buzz,that,went,through,the,gathering,an,angry,beelike,buzz,<END>
there,were,indignation,and,disappointment,in,the,sound,<END>
everyone,liked,will,everyone,respected,him,for,what,he,had,done,for,tara,<END>
everyone,knew,his,affections,lay,with,carreen,so,the,news,that,he,was,to,marry,the,neighborhood,pariah,instead,sat,ill,upon,them,<END>
good,old,will,marrying,that,nasty,sneaking,little,suellen,o'hara,<END>
for,a,moment,the,air,was,tense,<END>
mrs,tarleton's,eyes,began,to,snap,and,her,lips,to,shape,soundless,words,<END>
in,the,silence,old,man,mcrae's,high,voice,could,be,heard,imploring,his,grandson,to,tell,him,what,had,been,said,<END>
will,faced,them,all,still,mild,of,face,but,there,was,something,in,his,pale,blue,eyes,which,dared,them,to,say,one,word,about,his,future,wife,<END>
for,a,moment,the,balance,hung,between,the,honest,affection,everyone,had,for,will,and,their,contempt,for,suellen,<END>
and,will,won,<END>
he,continued,as,if,his,pause,had,been,a,natural,one,<END>
i,never,knew,mr,o'hara,in,his,prime,like,you,all,done,<END>
all,i,knew,personally,was,a,fine,old,gentleman,who,was,a,mite,addled,<END>
but,i've,heard,tell,from,you,all,'bout,what,he,used,to,be,like,<END>
and,i,want,to,say,this,<END>
he,was,a,fightin',irishman,and,a,southern,gentleman,and,as,loyal,a,confederate,as,ever,lived,<END>
you,can't,get,no,better,combination,than,that,<END>
and,we,ain't,likely,to,see,many,more,like,him,because,the,times,that,bred,men,like,him,are,as,dead,as,he,is,<END>
he,was,born,in,a,furrin,country,but,the,man,we're,buryin',here,today,was,more,of,a,georgian,than,any,of,us,mournin',him,<END>

i,know,what,i'm,doin',<END>
already,he,was,the,man,of,the,house,and,not,wishing,to,make,a,scene,scarlett,turned,helplessly,to,mrs,tarleton,<END>
that,lady,suddenly,diverted,as,will,had,intended,from,thoughts,of,suellen,to,the,always,fascinating,matter,of,breeding,be,it,animal,or,human,took,scarlett's,arm,<END>
come,in,the,house,honey,<END>
her,face,took,on,a,look,of,kind,absorbed,interest,and,scarlett,suffered,herself,to,be,led,through,the,crowd,that,gave,way,and,made,a,narrow,path,for,her,<END>
there,was,a,sympathetic,murmuring,as,she,passed,and,several,hands,went,out,to,pat,her,comfortingly,<END>
when,she,came,abreast,grandma,fontaine,the,old,lady,put,out,a,skinny,claw,and,said,give,me,your,arm,child,and,added,with,a,fierce,glance,at,sally,and,young,miss,no,don't,you,come,<END>
i,don't,want,you,<END>
they,passed,slowly,through,the,crowd,which,closed,behind,them,and,went,up,the,shady,path,toward,the,house,mrs,tarleton's,eager,helping,hand,so,strong,under,scarlett's,elbow,that,she,was,almost,lifted,from,the,ground,at,each,step,<END>
now,why,did,will,do,that,<END>
cried,scarlett,heatedly,when,they,were,out,of,earshot,<END>
he,practically,said,'look,at,her,<END>
she's,going,to,have,a,baby,',<END>
well,sake's,alive,you,are,aren't,you,<END>
said,mrs,tarleton,<END>
will,did,right,<END>
it,was,foolish,of,you,to,stand,in,the,hot,sun,when,you,might,have,fainted,and,had,a,miscarriage,<END>
will,wasn't,bothered,about,her,miscarrying,said,grandma,a,little,breathless,as,she,labored,across,the,front,yard,toward,the,steps,<END>
there,was,a,grim,knowing,smile,on,her,face,<END>
will's,smart,<END>
he,didn't,want,either,you,or,me,beetrice,at,the,graveside,<END>
he,was,scared,of,what,we'd,say,and,he,knew,this,was,the,only,way,to,get,rid,of,us,<END>
and,it,was,more,than,that,<END>
he,didn't,want,scarlett,to,hear,the,clods,dropping,on,the,coffin,<END>
and,he's,right,<END>
just,remember,scarlett,as,long,as,you,don't,hear,that,sound,folks,aren't,actually,dead,to,you,<END>
but,once,you,hear,it,<END>
well,it's,the,most,dreadfully,final,sound,in,the,world,<END>
help,me,up,the,steps,child,and,give,me,a,hand,beetrice,<END>
scarlett,don't,any,more,need,your,arm,than,she,needs,crutches,and,i'm,not,so,peart,as,will,observed,<END>
will,knew,you,were,your,father's,pet,and,he,didn't,want,to,make,it,worse,for,you,than,it,already,was,<END>
he,figured,it,wouldn't,be,so,bad,for,your,sisters,<END>
suellen,has,her,shame,to,sustain,her,and,carreen,her,god,<END>
but,you've,got,nothing,to,sustain,you,have,you,child,<END>
no,answered,scarlett,helping,the,old,lady,up,the,steps,faintly,surprised,at,the,truth,that,sounded,in,the,reedy,old,voice,<END>
i've,never,had,anything,to,sustain,me,except,mother,<END>
but,when,you,lost,her,you,found,you,could,stand,alone,didn't,you,<END>
well,some,folks,can't,<END>
your,pa,was,one,<END>
will's,right,<END>
don't,you,grieve,<END>
he,couldn't,get,along,without,ellen,and,he's,happier,where,he,is,<END>
just,like,i'll,be,happier,when,i,join,the,old,doctor,<END>
she,spoke,without,any,desire,for,sympathy,and,the,two,gave,her,none,<END>
she,spoke,as,briskly,and,naturally,as,if,her,husband,were,alive,and,in,jonesboro,and,a,short,buggy,ride,would,bring,them,together,<END>
grandma,was,too,old,and,had,seen,too,much,to,fear,death,<END>
but,you,can,stand,alone,too,said,scarlett,<END>
yes,but,it's,powerful,uncomfortable,at,times,<END>
look,here,grandma,interrupted,mrs,tarleton,you,ought,not,to,talk,to,scarlett,like,that,<END>
she's,upset,enough,already,<END>
what,with,her,trip,down,here,and,that,tight,dress,and,her,grief,and,the,heat,she's,got,enough,to,make,her,miscarry,without,your,adding,to,it,talking,grief,and,sorrow,<END>
god's,nightgown,<END>
cried,scarlett,in,irritation,<END>
i'm,not,upset,<END>
and,i'm,not,one,of,those,sickly,miscarrying,fools,<END>
you,never,can,tell,said,mrs,tarleton,omnisciently,<END>
i,lost,my,first,when,i,saw,a,bull,gore,one,of,our,darkies,and,you,remember,my,red,mare,nellie,<END>
now,there,was,the,healthiest-looking,mare,you,ever,saw,but,she,was,nervous,and,high,strung,and,if,i,didn't,watch,her,she'd,<END>
beetrice,hush,said,grandma,<END>
scarlett,wouldn't,miscarry,on,a,bet,<END>
let's,us,sit,here,in,the,hall,where,it's,cool,<END>
there's,a,nice,draft,through,here,<END>
now,you,go,fetch,us,a,glass,of,buttermilk,beetrice,if,there's,any,in,the,kitchen,<END>
or,look,in,the,pantry,and,see,if,there's,any,wine,<END>
i,could,do,with,a,glass,<END>
we'll,sit,here,till,the,folks,come,up,to,say,goodby,<END>
scarlett,ought,to,be,in,bed,insisted,mrs,tarleton,running,her,eyes,over,her,with,the,expert,air,of,one,who,calculated,a,pregnancy,to,the,last,minute,of,its,length,<END>
get,going,said,grandma,giving,her,a,prod,with,her,cane,and,mrs,tarleton,went,toward,the,kitchen,throwing,her,hat,carelessly,on,the,sideboard,and,running,her,hands,through,her,damp,red,hair,<END>
scarlett,lay,back,in,her,chair,and,unbuttoned,the,two,top,buttons,of,her,tight,basque,<END>
it,was,cool,and,dim,in,the,high-ceilinged,hall,and,the,vagrant,draft,that,went,from,back,to,front,of,the,house,was,refreshing,after,the,heat,of,the,sun,<END>
she,looked,across,the,hall,into,the,parlor,where,gerald,had,lain,and,wrenching,her,thoughts,from,him,looked,up,at,the,portrait,of,grandma,robillard,hanging,above,the,fireplace,<END>
the,bayonet-scarred,portrait,with,its,high-piled,hair,hall-exposed,breasts,and,cool,insolence,had,as,always,a,tonic,effect,upon,her,<END>
i,don't,know,which,hit,beetrice,tarleton,worse,losing,her,boys,or,her,horses,said,grandma,fontaine,<END>
she,never,did,pay,much,mind,to,jim,or,her,girls,you,know,<END>
she's,one,of,those,folks,will,was,talking,about,<END>
her,mainspring's,busted,<END>
sometimes,i,wonder,if,she,won't,go,the,way,your,pa,went,<END>
she,wasn't,ever,happy,unless,horses,or,humans,were,breeding,right,in,her,face,and,none,of,her,girls,are,married,or,got,any,prospects,of,catching,husbands,in,this,county,so,she's,got,nothing,to,occupy,her,mind,<END>
if,she,wasn't,such,lady,at,heart,she'd,be,downright,common,<END>
was,will,telling,the,truth,about,marrying,suellen,<END>
yes,said,scarlett,looking,the,old,lady,full,in,the,eye,<END>
goodness,she,could,remember,the,time,when,she,was,scared,to,death,of,grandma,fontaine,<END>
well,she'd,grown,up,since,then,and,she'd,just,as,soon,as,not,tell,her,to,go,to,the,devil,if,she,meddled,in,affairs,at,tara,<END>
he,could,do,better,said,grandma,candidly,<END>
indeed,<END>
said,scarlett,haughtily,<END>
come,off,your,high,horse,miss,said,the,old,lady,tartly,<END>
i,shan't,attack,your,precious,sister,though,i,might,have,if,i'd,stayed,at,the,burying,ground,<END>
what,i,mean,is,with,the,scarcity,of,men,in,the,neighborhood,will,could,marry,most,any,of,the,girls,<END>
there's,beetrice's,four,wild,cats,and,the,munroe,girls,and,the,mcrae,<END>
he's,going,to,marry,sue,and,that's,that,<END>
she's,lucky,to,get,him,<END>
tara,is,lucky,to,get,him,<END>
you,love,this,place,don't,you,<END>
yes,<END>
so,much,that,you,don't,mind,your,sister,marrying,out,of,her,class,as,long,as,you,have,a,man,around,to,care,for,tara,<END>
class,<END>
said,scarlett,startled,at,the,idea,<END>
class,<END>
what,does,class,matter,now,so,long,as,a,girl,gets,a,husband,who,can,take,care,of,her,<END>
that's,a,debatable,question,said,old,miss,<END>
some,folks,would,say,you,were,talking,common,sense,<END>
others,would,say,you,were,letting,down,bars,that,ought,never,be,lowered,one,inch,<END>
will's,certainly,not,quality,folks,and,some,of,your,people,were,<END>
her,sharp,old,eyes,went,to,the,portrait,of,grandma,robillard,<END>
scarlett,thought,of,will,lank,unimpressive,mild,eternally,chewing,a,straw,his,whole,appearance,deceptively,devoid,of,energy,like,that,of,most,crackers,<END>
he,did,not,have,behind,him,a,long,line,of,ancestors,of,wealth,prominence,and,blood,<END>
the,first,of,will's,family,to,set,foot,on,georgia,soil,might,even,have,been,one,of,oglethorpe's,debtors,or,a,bond,servant,<END>
will,had,not,been,to,college,<END>
in,fact,four,years,in,a,backwoods,school,was,all,the,education,he,had,ever,had,<END>
he,was,honest,and,he,was,loyal,he,was,patient,and,he,was,hard,working,but,certainly,he,was,not,quality,<END>
undoubtedly,by,robillard,standards,suellen,was,coming,down,in,the,world,<END>
so,you,approve,of,will,coming,into,your,family,<END>
yes,answered,scarlett,fiercely,ready,to,pounce,upon,the,old,lady,at,the,first,words,of,condemnation,<END>
you,may,kiss,me,said,grandma,surprisingly,and,she,smiled,in,her,most,approving,manner,<END>
i,never,liked,you,much,till,now,scarlett,<END>
you,were,always,hard,as,a,hickory,nut,even,as,a,child,and,i,don't,like,hard,females,barring,myself,<END>
but,i,do,like,the,way,you,meet,things,<END>
you,don't,make,a,fuss,about,things,that,can't,be,helped,even,if,they,are,disagreeable,<END>
you,take,your,fences,cleanly,like,a,good,hunter,<END>
scarlett,smiled,uncertainly,and,pecked,obediently,at,the,withered,cheek,presented,to,her,<END>
it,was,pleasant,to,hear,approving,words,again,even,if,she,had,little,idea,what,they,meant,<END>
there's,plenty,of,folks,hereabouts,who'll,have,something,to,say,about,you,letting,sue,marry,a,cracker,for,all,that,everybody,likes,will,<END>
they'll,say,in,one,breath,what,a,fine,man,he,is,and,how,terrible,it,is,for,an,o'hara,girl,to,marry,beneath,her,<END>
but,don't,you,let,it,bother,you,<END>
i've,never,bothered,about,what,people,said,<END>
so,i've,heard,<END>
there,was,a,hint,of,acid,in,the,old,voice,<END>
well,don't,bother,about,what,folks,say,<END>
it'll,probably,be,a,very,successful,marriage,<END>
of,course,will's,always,going,to,look,like,a,cracker,and,marriage,won't,improve,his,grammar,any,<END>
and,even,if,he,makes,a,mint,of,money,he'll,never,lend,any,shine,and,sparkle,to,tara,like,your,father,did,<END>
crackers,are,short,on,sparkle,<END>
but,will's,a,gentleman,at,heart,<END>
he's,got,the,right,instincts,<END>
nobody,but,a,born,gentleman,could,have,put,his,finger,on,what,is,wrong,with,us,as,accurately,as,he,just,did,down,there,at,the,burying,<END>
the,whole,world,can't,lick,us,but,we,can,lick,ourselves,by,longing,too,hard,for,things,we,haven't,got,any,more,and,by,remembering,too,much,<END>
yes,will,will,do,well,by,suellen,and,by,tara,<END>
then,you,approve,of,me,letting,him,marry,her,<END>
god,no,<END>
the,old,voice,was,tired,and,bitter,but,vigorous,<END>
approve,of,crackers,marrying,into,old,families,<END>
bah,<END>
would,i,approve,of,breeding,scrub,stock,to,thoroughbreds,<END>
oh,crackers,are,good,and,solid,and,honest,but,<END>
but,you,said,you,thought,it,would,be,a,successful,match,<END>
cried,scarlett,bewildered,<END>
oh,i,think,it's,good,for,suellen,to,marry,will,to,marry,anybody,for,that,matter,because,she,needs,a,husband,bad,<END>
and,where,else,could,she,get,one,<END>
and,where,else,could,you,get,as,good,a,manager,for,tara,<END>
but,that,doesn't,mean,i,like,the,situation,any,better,than,you,do,<END>
but,i,do,like,it,thought,scarlett,trying,to,grasp,the,old,lady's,meaning,<END>
i'm,glad,will,is,going,to,marry,her,<END>
why,should,she,think,i,minded,<END>
she's,taking,it,for,granted,that,i,do,mind,just,like,her,<END>
she,felt,puzzled,and,a,little,ashamed,as,always,when,people,attributed,to,her,emotions,and,motives,they,possessed,and,thought,she,shared,<END>
grandma,fanned,herself,with,her,palmetto,leaf,and,went,on,briskly,i,don't,approve,of,the,match,any,more,than,you,do,but,i'm,practical,and,so,are,you,<END>
and,when,it,comes,to,something,that's,unpleasant,but,can't,be,helped,i,don't,see,any,sense,in,screaming,and,kicking,about,it,<END>
that's,no,way,to,meet,the,ups,and,downs,of,life,<END>
i,know,because,my,family,and,the,old,doctor's,family,have,had,more,than,our,share,of,ups,and,downs,<END>
and,if,we,folks,have,a,motto,it's,this,'don't,holler,smile,and,bide,your,time,',<END>
we've,survived,a,passel,of,things,that,way,smiling,and,biding,our,time,and,we've,gotten,to,be,experts,at,surviving,<END>
we,had,to,be,<END>
we've,always,bet,on,the,wrong,horses,<END>
run,out,of,france,with,the,huguenots,run,out,of,england,with,the,cavaliers,run,out,of,scotland,with,bonnie,prince,charlie,run,out,of,haiti,by,the,niggers,and,now,licked,by,the,yankees,<END>
but,we,always,turn,up,on,top,in,a,few,years,<END>
you,know,why,<END>
she,cocked,her,head,and,scarlett,thought,she,looked,like,nothing,so,much,as,an,old,knowing,parrot,<END>
no,i,don't,know,i'm,sure,she,answered,politely,<END>
but,she,was,heartily,bored,even,as,she,had,been,the,day,when,grandma,launched,on,her,memories,of,the,creek,uprising,<END>
well,this,is,the,reason,<END>
we,bow,to,the,inevitable,<END>
we're,not,wheat,we're,buckwheat,<END>
when,a,storm,comes,along,it,flattens,ripe,wheat,because,it's,dry,and,can't,bend,with,the,wind,<END>
but,ripe,buckwheat's,got,sap,in,it,and,it,bends,<END>
and,when,the,wind,has,passed,it,springs,up,almost,as,straight,and,strong,as,before,<END>
we,aren't,a,stiff-necked,tribe,<END>
we're,mighty,limber,when,a,hard,wind's,blowing,because,we,know,it,pays,to,be,limber,<END>
when,trouble,comes,we,bow,to,the,inevitable,without,any,mouthing,and,we,work,and,we,smile,and,we,bide,our,time,<END>
and,we,play,along,with,lesser,folks,and,we,take,what,we,can,get,from,them,<END>
and,when,we're,strong,enough,we,kick,the,folks,whose,necks,we've,climbed,over,<END>
that,my,child,is,the,secret,of,the,survival,<END>
and,after,a,pause,she,added,i,pass,it,on,to,you,<END>
the,old,lady,cackled,as,if,she,were,amused,by,her,words,despite,the,venom,in,them,<END>
she,looked,as,if,she,expected,some,comment,from,scarlett,but,the,words,had,made,little,sense,to,her,and,she,could,think,of,nothing,to,say,<END>
no,sir,old,miss,went,on,our,folks,get,flattened,out,but,they,rise,up,again,and,that's,more,than,i,can,say,for,plenty,of,people,not,so,far,away,from,here,<END>
look,at,cathleen,calvert,<END>
you,can,see,what,she's,come,to,<END>
poor,white,<END>
and,a,heap,lower,than,the,man,she,married,<END>
look,at,the,mcrae,family,<END>
flat,to,the,ground,helpless,don't,know,what,to,do,don't,know,how,to,do,anything,<END>
won't,even,try,<END>
they,spend,their,time,whining,about,the,good,old,days,<END>
and,look,at,well,look,at,nearly,anybody,in,this,county,except,my,alex,and,my,sally,and,you,and,jim,tarleton,and,his,girls,and,some,others,<END>
the,rest,have,gone,under,because,they,didn't,have,any,sap,in,them,because,they,didn't,have,the,gumption,to,rise,up,again,<END>
there,never,was,anything,to,those,folks,but,money,and,darkies,and,now,that,the,money,and,darkies,are,gone,those,folks,will,be,cracker,in,another,generation,<END>
you,forgot,the,wilkes,<END>
no,i,didn't,forget,them,<END>
i,just,thought,i'd,be,polite,and,not,mention,them,seeing,that,ashley's,a,guest,under,this,roof,<END>
but,seeing,as,how,you've,brought,up,their,names,look,at,them,<END>
there's,india,who,from,all,i,hear,is,a,dried-up,old,maid,already,giving,herself,all,kinds,of,widowed,airs,because,stu,tarleton,was,killed,and,not,making,any,effort,to,forget,him,and,try,to,catch,another,man,<END>
of,course,she's,old,but,she,could,catch,some,widower,with,a,big,family,if,she,tried,<END>
and,poor,honey,was,always,a,man-crazy,fool,with,no,more,sense,than,a,guinea,hen,<END>
and,as,for,ashley,look,at,him,<END>
ashley,is,a,very,fine,man,began,scarlett,hotly,<END>
i,never,said,he,wasn't,but,he's,as,helpless,as,a,turtle,on,his,back,<END>
if,the,wilkes,family,pulls,through,these,hard,times,it'll,be,melly,who,pulls,them,through,<END>
not,ashley,<END>
melly,<END>
lord,grandma,<END>
what,are,you,talking,about,<END>
i've,lived,with,melly,long,enough,to,know,she's,sickly,and,scared,and,hasn't,the,gumption,to,say,boo,to,a,goose,<END>
now,why,on,earth,should,anyone,want,to,say,boo,to,a,goose,<END>
it,always,sounded,like,a,waste,of,time,to,me,<END>
she,might,not,say,boo,to,a,goose,but,she'd,say,boo,to,the,world,or,the,yankee,government,or,anything,else,that,threatened,her,precious,ashley,or,her,boy,or,her,notions,of,gentility,<END>
her,way,isn't,your,way,scarlett,or,my,way,<END>
it's,the,way,your,mother,would,have,acted,if,she'd,lived,<END>
melly,puts,me,in,mind,of,your,mother,when,she,was,young,<END>
and,maybe,she'll,pull,the,wilkes,family,through,<END>
oh,melly's,a,well-meaning,little,ninny,<END>
but,you,are,very,unjust,to,ashley,<END>
he's,<END>
oh,foot,<END>
ashley,was,bred,to,read,books,and,nothing,else,<END>
that,doesn't,help,a,man,pull,himself,out,of,a,tough,fix,like,we're,all,in,now,<END>
from,what,i,hear,he's,the,worst,plow,hand,in,the,county,<END>
now,you,just,compare,him,with,my,alex,<END>
before,the,war,alex,was,the,most,worthless,dandy,in,the,world,and,he,never,had,a,thought,beyond,a,new,cravat,and,getting,drunk,and,shooting,somebody,and,chasing,girls,who,were,no,better,than,they,should,be,<END>
but,look,at,him,now,<END>
he,learned,farming,because,he,had,to,learn,<END>
he'd,have,starved,and,so,would,all,of,us,<END>
now,he,raises,the,best,cotton,in,the,county,yes,miss,<END>
it's,a,heap,better,than,tara,cotton,and,he,knows,what,to,do,with,hogs,and,chickens,<END>
ha,<END>
he's,a,fine,boy,for,all,his,bad,temper,<END>
he,knows,how,to,bide,his,time,and,change,with,changing,ways,and,when,all,this,reconstruction,misery,is,over,you're,going,to,see,my,alex,as,rich,a,man,as,his,father,and,his,grandfather,were,<END>
but,ashley,<END>
scarlett,was,smarting,at,the,slight,to,ashley,<END>
it,all,sounds,like,tootle,to,me,she,said,coldly,<END>
well,it,shouldn't,said,grandma,fastening,a,sharp,eye,upon,her,<END>
for,it's,just,exactly,the,course,you've,been,following,since,you,went,to,atlanta,<END>
oh,yes,<END>
we,hear,of,your,didoes,even,if,we,are,buried,down,here,in,the,country,<END>
you've,changed,with,the,changing,times,too,<END>
we,hear,how,you,suck,up,to,the,yankees,and,the,white,trash,and,the,new-rich,carpetbaggers,to,get,money,out,of,them,<END>
butter,doesn't,melt,in,your,mouth,from,all,i,can,hear,<END>
well,go,to,it,i,say,<END>
and,get,every,cent,out,of,them,you,can,but,when,you've,got,enough,money,kick,them,in,the,face,because,they,can't,serve,you,any,longer,<END>
be,sure,you,do,that,and,do,it,properly,for,trash,hanging,onto,your,coat,tails,can,ruin,you,<END>
scarlett,looked,at,her,her,brow,wrinkling,with,the,effort,to,digest,the,words,<END>
they,still,didn't,make,much,sense,and,she,was,still,angry,at,ashley,being,called,a,turtle,on,his,back,<END>
i,think,you're,wrong,about,ashley,she,said,abruptly,<END>
scarlett,you,just,aren't,smart,<END>
that's,your,opinion,said,scarlett,rudely,wishing,it,were,permissible,to,smack,old,ladies',jaws,<END>
oh,you're,smart,enough,about,dollars,and,cents,<END>
that's,a,man's,way,of,being,smart,<END>
but,you,aren't,smart,at,all,like,a,woman,<END>
you,aren't,a,speck,smart,about,folks,<END>
scarlett's,eyes,began,to,snap,fire,and,her,hands,to,clench,and,unclench,<END>
i've,made,you,good,and,mad,haven't,i,<END>
asked,the,old,lady,smiling,<END>
well,i,aimed,to,do,just,that,<END>
oh,you,did,did,you,<END>
and,why,pray,<END>
i,had,good,and,plenty,reasons,<END>
grandma,sank,back,in,her,chair,and,scarlett,suddenly,realized,that,she,looked,very,tired,and,incredibly,old,<END>
the,tiny,clawlike,hands,folded,over,the,fan,were,yellow,and,waxy,as,a,dead,person's,<END>
the,anger,went,out,of,scarlett's,heart,as,a,thought,came,to,her,<END>
she,leaned,over,and,took,one,of,the,hands,in,hers,<END>
you're,a,mighty,sweet,old,liar,she,said,<END>
you,didn't,mean,a,word,of,all,this,rigmarole,<END>
you've,just,been,talking,to,keep,my,mind,off,pa,haven't,you,<END>
don't,fiddle,with,me,<END>
said,old,miss,grumpily,jerking,away,her,hand,<END>
partly,for,that,reason,partly,because,what,i've,been,telling,you,is,the,truth,and,you're,just,too,stupid,to,realize,it,<END>
but,she,smiled,a,little,and,took,the,sting,from,her,words,<END>
scarlett's,heart,emptied,itself,of,wrath,about,ashley,<END>
it,was,nice,to,know,grandma,hadn't,meant,any,of,it,<END>
thank,you,just,the,same,<END>
it,was,nice,of,you,to,talk,to,me,and,i'm,glad,to,know,you're,with,me,about,will,and,suellen,even,if,even,if,a,lot,of,other,people,do,disapprove,<END>
mrs,tarleton,came,down,the,hall,carrying,two,glasses,of,buttermilk,<END>
she,did,all,domestic,things,badly,and,the,glasses,were,slopping,over,<END>
i,had,to,go,clear,to,the,spring,house,to,get,it,she,said,<END>
drink,it,quick,because,the,folks,are,coming,up,from,the,burying,ground,<END>
scarlett,are,you,really,going,to,let,suellen,marry,will,<END>
not,that,he,isn't,a,sight,too,good,for,her,but,you,know,he,is,a,cracker,and,<END>

there,was,a,wicked,sparkle,in,the,old,eyes,that,found,an,answer,in,her,own,<END>
chapter,xli,<END>
when,the,last,good-by,had,been,said,and,the,last,sound,of,wheels,and,hooves,died,away,scarlett,went,into,ellen's,office,and,removed,a,gleaming,object,from,where,she,had,hidden,it,the,night,before,between,the,yellowed,papers,in,the,pigeon-holes,of,the,secretary,<END>

ashley,sat,on,ellen's,little,writing,chair,his,long,body,dwarfing,the,frail,bit,of,furniture,while,scarlett,offered,him,a,half-,interest,in,the,mill,<END>
not,once,did,his,eyes,meet,hers,and,he,spoke,no,word,of,interruption,<END>
he,sat,looking,down,at,his,hands,turning,them,over,slowly,inspecting,first,palms,and,then,backs,as,though,he,had,never,seen,them,before,<END>
despite,hard,work,they,were,still,slender,and,sensitive,looking,and,remarkably,well,tended,for,a,farmer's,hands,<END>
his,bowed,head,and,silence,disturbed,her,a,little,and,she,redoubled,her,efforts,to,make,the,mill,sound,attractive,<END>
she,brought,to,bear,too,all,the,charm,of,smile,and,glance,she,possessed,but,they,were,wasted,for,he,did,not,raise,his,eyes,<END>
if,he,would,only,look,at,her,<END>
she,made,no,mention,of,the,information,will,had,given,her,of,ashley's,determination,to,go,north,and,spoke,with,the,outward,assumption,that,no,obstacle,stood,in,the,way,of,his,agreement,with,her,plan,<END>
still,he,did,not,speak,and,finally,her,words,trailed,into,silence,<END>
there,was,a,determined,squareness,about,his,slender,shoulders,that,alarmed,her,<END>
surely,he,wouldn't,refuse,<END>
what,earthly,reason,could,he,have,for,refusing,<END>
ashley,she,began,again,and,paused,<END>
she,had,not,intended,using,her,pregnancy,as,an,argument,had,shrunk,from,the,thought,of,ashley,even,seeing,her,so,bloated,and,ugly,but,as,her,other,persuasions,seemed,to,have,made,no,impression,she,decided,to,use,it,and,her,helplessness,as,a,last,card,<END>
you,must,come,to,atlanta,<END>
i,do,need,your,help,so,badly,now,because,i,can't,look,after,the,mills,<END>
it,may,be,months,before,i,can,because,you,see,well,because,<END>
please,<END>
he,said,roughly,<END>
good,god,scarlett,<END>
he,rose,and,went,abruptly,to,the,window,and,stood,with,his,back,to,her,watching,the,solemn,single,file,of,ducks,parade,across,the,barnyard,<END>
is,that,is,that,why,you,won't,look,at,me,<END>
she,questioned,forlornly,<END>
i,know,i,look,<END>
he,swung,around,in,a,flash,and,his,gray,eyes,met,hers,with,an,intensity,that,made,her,hands,go,to,her,throat,<END>
damn,your,looks,<END>
he,said,with,a,swift,violence,<END>
you,know,you,always,look,beautiful,to,me,<END>
happiness,flooded,her,until,her,eyes,were,liquid,with,tears,<END>
how,sweet,of,you,to,say,that,<END>
for,i,was,so,ashamed,to,let,you,see,me,<END>
you,ashamed,<END>
why,should,you,be,ashamed,<END>
i'm,the,one,to,feel,shame,and,i,do,<END>
if,it,hadn't,been,for,my,stupidity,you,wouldn't,be,in,this,fix,<END>
you'd,never,have,married,frank,<END>
i,should,never,have,let,you,leave,tara,last,winter,<END>
oh,fool,that,i,was,<END>
i,should,have,known,you,known,you,were,desperate,so,desperate,that,you'd,i,should,have,i,should,have,his,face,went,haggard,<END>
scarlett's,heart,beat,wildly,<END>
he,was,regretting,that,he,had,not,run,away,with,her,<END>
the,least,i,could,have,done,was,go,out,and,commit,highway,robbery,or,murder,to,get,the,tax,money,for,you,when,you,had,taken,us,in,as,beggars,<END>
oh,i,messed,it,up,all,the,way,around,<END>
her,heart,contracted,with,disappointment,and,some,of,the,happiness,went,from,her,for,these,were,not,the,words,she,hoped,to,hear,<END>
i,would,have,gone,anyway,she,said,tiredly,<END>
i,couldn't,have,let,you,do,anything,like,that,<END>
and,anyway,it's,done,now,<END>
yes,it's,done,now,he,said,with,slow,bitterness,<END>
you,wouldn't,have,let,me,do,anything,dishonorable,but,you,would,sell,yourself,to,a,man,you,didn't,love,and,bear,his,child,so,that,my,family,and,i,wouldn't,starve,<END>
it,was,kind,of,you,to,shelter,my,helplessness,<END>
the,edge,in,his,voice,spoke,of,a,raw,unhealed,wound,that,ached,within,him,and,his,words,brought,shame,to,her,eyes,<END>
he,was,swift,to,see,it,and,his,face,changed,to,gentleness,<END>
you,didn't,think,i,was,blaming,you,<END>
dear,god,scarlett,<END>
no,<END>
you,are,the,bravest,woman,i've,ever,known,<END>
it's,myself,i'm,blaming,<END>
he,turned,and,looked,out,of,the,window,again,and,the,shoulders,presented,to,her,gaze,did,not,look,quite,so,square,<END>
scarlett,waited,a,long,moment,in,silence,hoping,that,ashley,would,return,to,the,mood,in,which,he,spoke,of,her,beauty,hoping,he,would,say,more,words,that,she,could,treasure,<END>
it,had,been,so,long,since,she,had,seen,him,and,she,had,lived,on,memories,until,they,were,worn,thin,<END>
she,knew,he,still,loved,her,<END>
that,fact,was,evident,in,every,line,of,him,in,every,bitter,self-condemnatory,word,in,his,resentment,at,her,bearing,frank's,child,<END>
she,so,longed,to,hear,him,say,it,in,words,longed,to,speak,words,herself,that,would,provoke,a,confession,but,she,dared,not,<END>
she,remembered,her,promise,given,last,winter,in,the,orchard,that,she,would,never,again,throw,herself,at,his,head,<END>
sadly,she,knew,that,promise,must,be,kept,if,ashley,were,to,remain,near,her,<END>
one,cry,from,her,of,love,and,longing,one,look,that,pleaded,for,his,arms,and,the,matter,would,be,settled,forever,<END>
ashley,would,surely,go,to,new,york,<END>
and,he,must,not,go,away,<END>
oh,ashley,don't,blame,yourself,<END>
how,could,it,be,your,fault,<END>
you,will,come,to,atlanta,and,help,me,won't,you,<END>
no,<END>
but,ashley,her,voice,was,beginning,to,break,with,anguish,and,disappointment,but,i'd,counted,on,you,<END>
i,do,need,you,so,<END>
frank,can't,help,me,<END>
he's,so,busy,with,the,store,and,if,you,don't,come,i,don't,know,where,i,can,get,a,man,<END>
everybody,in,atlanta,who,is,smart,is,busy,with,his,own,affairs,and,the,others,are,so,incompetent,and,<END>
it's,no,use,scarlett,<END>
you,mean,you'd,rather,go,to,new,york,and,live,among,yankees,than,come,to,atlanta,<END>
who,told,you,that,<END>
he,turned,and,faced,her,faint,annoyance,wrinkling,his,forehead,<END>
will,<END>
yes,i've,decided,to,go,north,<END>
an,old,friend,who,made,the,grand,tour,with,me,before,the,war,has,offered,me,a,position,in,his,father's,bank,<END>
it's,better,so,scarlett,<END>
i'd,be,no,good,to,you,<END>
i,know,nothing,of,the,lumber,business,<END>
but,you,know,less,about,banking,and,it's,much,harder,<END>
and,i,know,i'd,make,far,more,allowances,for,your,inexperience,than,yankees,would,<END>
he,winced,and,she,knew,she,had,said,the,wrong,thing,<END>
he,turned,and,looked,out,of,the,window,again,<END>
i,don't,want,allowances,made,for,me,<END>
i,want,to,stand,on,my,own,feet,for,what,i'm,worth,<END>
what,have,i,done,with,my,life,up,till,now,<END>
it's,time,i,made,something,of,myself,or,went,down,through,my,own,fault,<END>
i've,been,your,pensioner,too,long,already,<END>
but,i'm,offering,you,a,half-interest,in,the,mill,ashley,<END>
you,would,be,standing,on,your,own,feet,because,you,see,it,would,be,your,own,business,<END>
it,would,amount,to,the,same,thing,<END>
i'd,not,be,buying,the,half-,interest,<END>
i'd,be,taking,it,as,a,gift,<END>
and,i've,taken,too,many,gifts,from,you,already,scarlett,food,and,shelter,and,even,clothes,for,myself,and,melanie,and,the,baby,<END>
and,i've,given,you,nothing,in,return,<END>
oh,but,you,have,<END>
will,couldn't,have,<END>
i,can,split,kindling,very,nicely,now,<END>
oh,ashley,<END>
she,cried,despairingly,tears,in,her,eyes,at,the,jeering,note,in,his,voice,<END>
what,has,happened,to,you,since,i've,been,gone,<END>
you,sound,so,hard,and,bitter,<END>
you,didn't,used,to,be,this,way,<END>
what's,happened,<END>
a,very,remarkable,thing,scarlett,<END>
i've,been,thinking,<END>
i,don't,believe,i,really,thought,from,the,time,of,the,surrender,until,you,went,away,from,here,<END>
i,was,in,a,state,of,suspended,animation,and,it,was,enough,that,i,had,something,to,eat,and,a,bed,to,lie,on,<END>
but,when,you,went,to,atlanta,shouldering,a,man's,burden,i,saw,myself,as,much,less,than,a,man,much,less,indeed,than,a,woman,<END>
such,thoughts,aren't,pleasant,to,live,with,and,i,do,not,intend,to,live,with,them,any,longer,<END>
other,men,came,out,of,the,war,with,less,than,i,had,and,look,at,them,now,<END>
so,i'm,going,to,new,york,<END>
but,i,don't,understand,<END>
if,it's,work,you,want,why,won't,atlanta,do,as,well,as,new,york,<END>
and,my,mill,<END>
no,scarlett,<END>
this,is,my,last,chance,<END>
i'll,go,north,<END>
if,i,go,to,atlanta,and,work,for,you,i'm,lost,forever,<END>
the,word,lost,lost,lost,dinged,frighteningly,in,her,heart,like,a,death,bell,sounding,<END>
her,eyes,went,quickly,to,his,but,they,were,wide,and,crystal,gray,and,they,were,looking,through,her,and,beyond,her,at,some,fate,she,could,not,see,could,not,understand,<END>
lost,<END>
do,you,mean,have,you,done,something,the,atlanta,yankees,can,get,you,for,<END>
i,mean,about,helping,tony,get,away,or,or,oh,ashley,you,aren't,in,the,ku,klux,are,you,<END>
his,remote,eyes,came,back,to,her,swiftly,and,he,smiled,a,brief,smile,that,never,reached,his,eyes,<END>
i,had,forgotten,you,were,so,literal,<END>
no,it's,not,the,yankees,i'm,afraid,of,<END>
i,mean,if,i,go,to,atlanta,and,take,help,from,you,again,i,bury,forever,any,hope,of,ever,standing,alone,<END>
oh,she,sighed,in,quick,relief,if,it's,only,that,<END>
yes,and,he,smiled,again,the,smile,more,wintry,than,before,<END>
only,that,<END>
only,my,masculine,pride,my,self-respect,and,if,you,choose,to,so,call,it,my,immortal,soul,<END>
but,she,swung,around,on,another,tack,you,could,gradually,buy,the,mill,from,me,and,it,would,be,your,own,and,then,<END>
scarlett,he,interrupted,fiercely,i,tell,you,no,<END>
there,are,other,reasons,<END>
what,reasons,<END>

his,eyes,wide,and,stormy,met,hers,for,an,instant,and,then,he,went,swiftly,across,the,room,<END>
his,hand,was,on,the,door,knob,<END>
scarlett,stared,at,him,in,agony,<END>
the,interview,was,ended,and,she,had,lost,<END>
suddenly,weak,from,the,strain,and,sorrow,of,the,last,day,and,the,present,disappointment,her,nerves,broke,abruptly,and,she,screamed,oh,ashley,<END>
and,flinging,herself,down,on,the,sagging,sofa,she,burst,into,wild,crying,<END>
she,heard,his,uncertain,footsteps,leaving,the,door,and,his,helpless,voice,saying,her,name,over,and,over,above,her,head,<END>
there,was,a,swift,pattering,of,feet,racing,up,the,hall,from,the,kitchen,and,melanie,burst,into,the,room,her,eyes,wide,with,alarm,<END>
scarlett,<END>
the,baby,isn't,<END>
scarlett,burrowed,her,head,in,the,dusty,upholstery,and,screamed,again,<END>
ashley,he's,so,mean,<END>
so,doggoned,mean,so,hateful,<END>
oh,ashley,what,have,you,done,to,her,<END>
melanie,threw,herself,on,the,floor,beside,the,sofa,and,gathered,scarlett,into,her,arms,<END>
what,have,you,said,<END>
how,could,you,<END>
you,might,bring,on,the,baby,<END>
there,my,darling,put,your,head,on,melanie's,shoulder,<END>
what,is,wrong,<END>
ashley,he's,so,so,bullheaded,and,hateful,<END>

upsetting,her,so,much,and,in,her,condition,and,mr,o'hara,hardly,in,his,grave,<END>
don't,you,fuss,at,him,<END>
cried,scarlett,illogically,raising,her,head,abruptly,from,melanie's,shoulder,her,coarse,black,hair,tumbling,out,from,its,net,and,her,face,streaked,with,tears,<END>
he's,got,a,right,to,do,as,he,pleases,<END>
melanie,said,ashley,his,face,white,let,me,explain,<END>
scarlett,was,kind,enough,to,offer,me,a,position,in,atlanta,as,manager,of,one,of,her,mills,<END>
manager,<END>
cried,scarlett,indignantly,<END>
i,offered,him,a,half-,interest,and,he,<END>
and,i,told,her,i,had,already,made,arrangements,for,us,to,go,north,and,she,<END>
oh,cried,scarlett,beginning,to,sob,again,i,told,him,and,told,him,how,much,i,needed,him,how,i,couldn't,get,anybody,to,manage,the,mill,how,i,was,going,to,have,this,baby,and,he,refused,to,come,<END>
and,now,now,i'll,have,to,sell,the,mill,and,i,know,i,can't,get,anything,like,a,good,price,for,it,and,i'll,lose,money,and,i,guess,maybe,we'll,starve,but,he,won't,care,<END>
he's,so,mean,<END>
she,burrowed,her,head,back,into,melanie's,thin,shoulder,and,some,of,the,real,anguish,went,from,her,as,a,flicker,of,hope,woke,in,her,<END>
she,could,sense,that,in,melanie's,devoted,heart,she,had,an,ally,feel,melanie's,indignation,that,anyone,even,her,beloved,husband,should,make,scarlett,cry,<END>
melanie,flew,at,ashley,like,a,small,determined,dove,and,pecked,him,for,the,first,time,in,her,life,<END>
ashley,how,could,you,refuse,her,<END>
and,after,all,she's,done,for,us,<END>
how,ungrateful,you,make,us,appear,<END>
and,she,so,helpless,now,with,the,bab,how,unchivalrous,of,you,<END>
she,helped,us,when,we,needed,help,and,now,you,deny,her,when,she,needs,you,<END>
scarlett,peeped,slyly,at,ashley,and,saw,surprise,and,uncertainty,plain,in,his,face,as,he,looked,into,melanie's,dark,indignant,eyes,<END>
scarlett,was,surprised,too,at,the,vigor,of,melanie's,attack,for,she,knew,melanie,considered,her,husband,beyond,wifely,reproaches,and,thought,his,decisions,second,only,to,god's,<END>
melanie,<END>
he,began,and,then,threw,out,his,hands,helplessly,<END>
ashley,how,can,you,hesitate,<END>
think,what,she's,done,for,us,for,me,<END>
i'd,have,died,in,atlanta,when,beau,came,if,it,hadn't,been,for,her,<END>
and,she,yes,she,killed,a,yankee,defending,us,<END>
did,you,know,that,<END>
she,killed,a,man,for,us,<END>
and,she,worked,and,slaved,before,you,and,will,came,home,just,to,keep,food,in,our,mouths,<END>
and,when,i,think,of,her,plowing,and,picking,cotton,i,could,just,oh,my,darling,<END>
and,she,swooped,her,head,and,kissed,scarlett's,tumbled,hair,in,fierce,loyalty,<END>
and,now,the,first,time,she,asks,us,to,do,something,for,her,<END>
you,don't,need,to,tell,me,what,she,has,done,for,us,<END>
and,ashley,just,think,<END>
besides,helping,her,just,think,what,it'll,mean,for,us,to,live,in,atlanta,among,our,own,people,and,not,have,to,live,with,yankees,<END>
there'll,be,auntie,and,uncle,henry,and,all,our,friends,and,beau,can,have,lots,of,playmates,and,go,to,school,<END>
if,we,went,north,we,couldn't,let,him,go,to,school,and,associate,with,yankee,children,and,have,pickaninnies,in,his,class,<END>
we'd,have,to,have,a,governess,and,i,don't,see,how,we'd,afford,<END>
melanie,said,ashley,and,his,voice,was,deadly,quiet,do,you,really,want,to,go,to,atlanta,so,badly,<END>
you,never,said,so,when,we,talked,about,going,to,new,york,<END>
you,never,intimated,<END>
oh,but,when,we,talked,about,going,to,new,york,i,thought,there,was,nothing,for,you,in,atlanta,and,besides,it,wasn't,my,place,to,say,anything,<END>
it's,a,wife's,duty,to,go,where,her,husband,goes,<END>
but,now,that,scarlett,needs,us,so,and,has,a,position,that,only,you,can,fill,we,can,go,home,<END>
home,<END>
her,voice,was,rapturous,as,she,squeezed,scarlett,<END>
and,i'll,see,five,points,again,and,peachtree,road,and,and,oh,how,i've,missed,them,all,<END>
and,maybe,we,could,have,a,little,home,of,our,own,<END>
i,wouldn't,care,how,little,and,tacky,it,was,but,a,home,of,our,own,<END>
her,eyes,blazed,with,enthusiasm,and,happiness,and,the,two,stared,at,her,ashley,with,a,queer,stunned,look,scarlett,with,surprise,mingled,with,shame,<END>
it,had,never,occurred,to,her,that,melanie,missed,atlanta,so,much,and,longed,to,be,back,longed,for,a,home,of,her,own,<END>
she,had,seemed,so,contented,at,tara,it,came,to,scarlett,as,a,shock,that,she,was,homesick,<END>
oh,scarlett,how,good,of,you,to,plan,all,this,for,us,<END>
you,knew,how,i,longed,for,home,<END>
as,usual,when,confronted,by,melanie's,habit,of,attributing,worthy,motives,where,no,worth,existed,scarlett,was,ashamed,and,irritated,and,suddenly,she,could,not,meet,either,ashley's,or,melanie's,eyes,<END>
we,could,get,a,little,house,of,our,own,<END>
do,you,realize,that,we've,been,married,five,years,and,never,had,a,home,<END>
you,can,stay,with,us,at,aunt,pitty's,<END>
that's,your,home,mumbled,scarlett,toying,with,a,pillow,and,keeping,her,eyes,down,to,hide,dawning,triumph,in,them,as,she,felt,the,tide,turning,her,way,<END>
no,but,thank,you,just,the,same,darling,<END>
that,would,crowd,us,so,<END>
we'll,get,a,house,oh,ashley,do,say,yes,<END>
scarlett,said,ashley,and,his,voice,was,toneless,look,at,me,<END>
startled,she,looked,up,and,met,gray,eyes,that,were,bitter,and,full,of,tired,futility,<END>
scarlett,i,will,come,to,atlanta,<END>
i,cannot,fight,you,both,<END>
he,turned,and,walked,out,of,the,room,<END>
some,of,the,triumph,in,her,heart,was,dulled,by,a,nagging,fear,<END>
the,look,in,his,eyes,when,he,spoke,had,been,the,same,as,when,he,said,he,would,be,lost,forever,if,he,came,to,atlanta,<END>
after,suellen,and,will,married,and,carreen,went,off,to,charleston,to,the,convent,ashley,melanie,and,beau,came,to,atlanta,bringing,dilcey,with,them,to,cook,and,nurse,<END>
prissy,and,pork,were,left,at,tara,until,such,a,time,as,will,could,get,other,darkies,to,help,him,in,the,fields,and,then,they,too,would,come,to,town,<END>
the,little,brick,house,that,ashley,took,for,his,family,was,on,ivy,street,directly,behind,aunt,pitty's,house,and,the,two,back,yards,ran,together,divided,only,by,a,ragged,overgrown,privet,hedge,<END>
melanie,had,chosen,it,especially,for,this,reason,<END>
she,said,on,the,first,morning,of,her,return,to,atlanta,as,she,laughed,and,cried,and,embraced,scarlett,and,aunt,pitty,she,had,been,separated,from,her,loved,ones,for,so,long,that,she,could,never,be,close,enough,to,them,again,<END>
the,house,had,originally,been,two,stories,high,but,the,upper,floor,had,been,destroyed,by,shells,during,the,siege,and,the,owner,returning,after,the,surrender,had,lacked,the,money,to,replace,it,<END>
he,had,contented,himself,with,putting,a,flat,roof,on,the,remaining,first,floor,which,gave,the,building,the,squat,disproportionate,look,of,a,child's,playhouse,built,of,shoe,boxes,<END>
the,house,was,high,from,the,ground,built,over,a,large,cellar,and,the,long,sweeping,flight,of,stairs,which,reached,it,made,it,look,slightly,ridiculous,<END>
but,the,flat,squashed,look,of,the,place,was,partly,redeemed,by,the,two,fine,old,oaks,which,shaded,it,and,a,dusty-,leaved,magnolia,splotched,with,white,blossoms,standing,beside,the,front,steps,<END>
the,lawn,was,wide,and,green,with,thick,clover,and,bordering,it,was,a,straggling,unkempt,privet,hedge,interlaced,with,sweet-smelling,honeysuckle,vines,<END>
here,and,there,in,the,grass,roses,threw,out,sprangles,from,crushed,old,stems,and,pink,and,white,crepe,myrtle,bloomed,as,valiantly,as,if,war,had,not,passed,over,their,heads,and,yankee,horses,gnawed,their,boughs,<END>
scarlett,thought,it,quite,the,ugliest,dwelling,she,had,ever,seen,but,to,melanie,twelve,oaks,in,all,its,grandeur,had,not,been,more,beautiful,<END>
it,was,home,and,she,and,ashley,and,beau,were,at,last,together,under,their,own,roof,<END>
india,wilkes,came,back,from,macon,where,she,and,honey,had,lived,since,1864,and,took,up,her,residence,with,her,brother,crowding,the,occupants,of,the,little,house,<END>
but,ashley,and,melanie,welcomed,her,<END>
times,had,changed,money,was,scarce,but,nothing,had,altered,the,rule,of,southern,life,that,families,always,made,room,gladly,for,indigent,or,unmarried,female,relatives,<END>
honey,had,married,and,so,india,said,married,beneath,her,a,coarse,westerner,from,mississippi,who,had,settled,in,macon,<END>

india,had,not,approved,of,the,match,and,not,approving,had,not,been,happy,in,her,brother-in-,law's,home,<END>
she,welcomed,the,news,that,ashley,now,had,a,home,of,his,own,so,she,could,remove,herself,from,uncongenial,surroundings,and,also,from,the,distressing,sight,of,her,sister,so,fatuously,happy,with,a,man,unworthy,of,her,<END>
the,rest,of,the,family,privately,thought,that,the,giggling,and,simple-minded,honey,had,done,far,better,than,could,be,expected,and,they,marveled,that,she,had,caught,any,man,<END>
her,husband,was,a,gentleman,and,a,man,of,some,means,but,to,india,born,in,georgia,and,reared,in,virginia,traditions,anyone,not,from,the,eastern,seaboard,was,a,boor,and,a,barbarian,<END>
probably,honey's,husband,was,as,happy,to,be,relieved,of,her,company,as,she,was,to,leave,him,for,india,was,not,easy,to,live,with,these,days,<END>
the,mantle,of,spinsterhood,was,definitely,on,her,shoulders,now,<END>
she,was,twenty-five,and,looked,it,and,so,there,was,no,longer,any,need,for,her,to,try,to,be,attractive,<END>
her,pale,lashless,eyes,looked,directly,and,uncompromisingly,upon,the,world,and,her,thin,lips,were,ever,set,in,haughty,tightness,<END>
there,was,an,air,of,dignity,and,pride,about,her,now,that,oddly,enough,became,her,better,than,the,determined,girlish,sweetness,of,her,days,at,twelve,oaks,<END>
the,position,she,held,was,almost,that,of,a,widow,<END>
everyone,knew,that,stuart,tarleton,would,have,married,her,had,he,not,been,killed,at,gettysburg,and,so,she,was,accorded,the,respect,due,a,woman,who,had,been,wanted,if,not,wed,<END>
the,six,rooms,of,the,little,house,on,ivy,street,were,soon,scantily,furnished,with,the,cheapest,pine,and,oak,furniture,in,frank's,store,for,as,ashley,was,penniless,and,forced,to,buy,on,credit,he,refused,anything,except,the,least,expensive,and,bought,only,the,barest,necessities,<END>
this,embarrassed,frank,who,was,fond,of,ashley,and,it,distressed,scarlett,<END>
both,she,and,frank,would,willingly,have,given,without,any,charge,the,finest,mahogany,and,carved,rosewood,in,the,store,but,the,wilkeses,obstinately,refused,<END>
their,house,was,painfully,ugly,and,bare,and,scarlett,hated,to,see,ashley,living,in,the,uncarpeted,uncurtained,rooms,<END>
but,he,did,not,seem,to,notice,his,surroundings,and,melanie,having,her,own,home,for,the,first,time,since,her,marriage,was,so,happy,she,was,actually,proud,of,the,place,<END>
scarlett,would,have,suffered,agonies,of,humiliation,at,having,friends,find,her,without,draperies,and,carpets,and,cushions,and,the,proper,number,of,chairs,and,teacups,and,spoons,<END>

for,all,her,obvious,happiness,melanie,was,not,well,<END>
little,beau,had,cost,her,her,health,and,the,hard,work,she,had,done,at,tara,since,his,birth,had,taken,further,toll,of,her,strength,<END>

she,had,no,bust,and,her,hips,were,as,flat,as,little,beau's,and,as,she,had,neither,the,pride,nor,the,good,sense,so,scarlett,thought,to,sew,ruffles,in,the,bosom,of,her,basque,or,pads,on,the,back,of,her,corsets,her,thinness,was,very,obvious,<END>
like,her,body,her,face,was,too,thin,and,too,pale,and,her,silky,brows,arched,and,delicate,as,a,butterfly's,feelers,stood,out,too,blackly,against,her,colorless,skin,<END>
in,her,small,face,her,eyes,were,too,large,for,beauty,the,dark,smudges,under,them,making,them,appear,enormous,but,the,expression,in,them,had,not,altered,since,the,days,of,her,unworried,girlhood,<END>
war,and,constant,pain,and,hard,work,had,been,powerless,against,their,sweet,tranquillity,<END>

everyone,brought,presents,for,the,house,bric-a-brac,pictures,a,silver,spoon,or,two,linen,pillow,cases,napkins,rag,rugs,small,articles,which,they,had,saved,from,sherman,and,treasured,but,which,they,now,swore,were,of,no,earthly,use,to,them,<END>

her,contemporaries,the,young,wives,mothers,and,widows,loved,her,because,she,had,suffered,what,they,had,suffered,had,not,become,embittered,and,always,lent,them,a,sympathetic,ear,<END>

it,was,as,if,atlanta,society,scattered,and,wrecked,by,war,depleted,by,death,bewildered,by,change,had,found,in,her,an,unyielding,nucleus,about,which,it,could,re-form,<END>

and,there,were,many,such,<END>
there,were,men,of,good,family,driven,to,desperation,by,poverty,who,had,gone,over,to,the,enemy,become,republicans,and,accepted,positions,from,the,conquerors,so,their,families,would,not,be,on,charity,<END>

the,truth,of,the,matter,was,that,melanie,had,diplomatically,managed,to,amalgamate,the,lady,harpists,the,gentlemen's,glee,club,and,the,young,ladies,mandolin,and,guitar,society,with,the,saturday,night,musical,circle,so,that,now,atlanta,had,music,worth,listening,to,<END>

leasing,convicts,was,the,very,worst,of,all,the,wild,schemes,scarlett,had,ever,suggested,worse,even,than,her,notion,of,building,a,saloon,<END>
at,least,it,seemed,worse,to,frank,and,the,conservative,circles,in,which,he,moved,<END>
this,new,system,of,leasing,convicts,had,come,into,being,because,of,the,poverty,of,the,state,after,the,war,<END>
unable,to,support,the,convicts,the,state,was,hiring,them,out,to,those,needing,large,labor,crews,in,the,building,of,railroads,in,turpentine,forests,and,lumber,camps,<END>
while,frank,and,his,quiet,churchgoing,friends,realized,the,necessity,of,the,system,they,deplored,it,just,the,same,<END>
many,of,them,had,not,even,believed,in,slavery,and,they,thought,this,was,far,worse,than,slavery,had,ever,been,<END>
and,scarlett,wanted,to,lease,convicts,<END>
frank,knew,that,if,she,did,he,could,never,hold,up,his,head,again,<END>
this,was,far,worse,than,owning,and,operating,the,mills,herself,or,anything,else,she,had,done,<END>
his,past,objections,had,always,been,coupled,with,the,question,what,will,people,say,<END>
but,this,this,went,deeper,than,fear,of,public,opinion,<END>
he,felt,that,it,was,a,traffic,in,human,bodies,on,a,par,with,prostitution,a,sin,that,would,be,on,his,soul,if,he,permitted,her,to,do,it,<END>
from,this,conviction,of,wrongness,frank,gathered,courage,to,forbid,scarlett,to,do,such,a,thing,and,so,strong,were,his,remarks,that,she,startled,relapsed,into,silence,<END>
finally,to,quiet,him,she,said,meekly,she,hadn't,really,meant,it,<END>
she,was,just,so,outdone,with,hugh,and,the,free,niggers,she,had,lost,her,temper,<END>
secretly,she,still,thought,about,it,and,with,some,longing,<END>
convict,labor,would,settle,one,of,her,hardest,problems,but,if,frank,was,going,to,take,on,so,about,it,<END>
she,sighed,<END>
if,even,one,of,the,mills,were,making,money,she,could,stand,it,<END>
but,ashley,was,faring,little,better,with,his,mill,than,hugh,<END>
at,first,scarlett,was,shocked,and,disappointed,that,ashley,did,not,immediately,take,hold,and,make,the,mill,pay,double,what,it,had,paid,under,her,management,<END>
he,was,so,smart,and,he,had,read,so,many,books,and,there,was,no,reason,at,all,why,he,should,not,make,a,brilliant,success,and,lots,of,money,<END>
but,he,was,no,more,successful,than,hugh,<END>
his,inexperience,his,errors,his,utter,lack,of,business,judgment,and,his,scruples,about,close,dealing,were,the,same,as,hugh's,<END>
scarlett's,love,hastily,found,excuses,for,him,and,she,did,not,consider,the,two,men,in,the,same,light,<END>
hugh,was,just,hopelessly,stupid,while,ashley,was,merely,new,at,the,business,<END>
still,unbidden,came,the,thought,that,ashley,could,never,make,a,quick,estimate,in,his,head,and,give,a,price,that,was,correct,as,she,could,<END>
and,she,sometimes,wondered,if,he'd,ever,learn,to,distinguish,between,planking,and,sills,<END>
and,because,he,was,a,gentleman,and,himself,trustworthy,he,trusted,every,scoundrel,who,came,along,and,several,times,would,have,lost,money,for,her,if,she,had,not,tactfully,intervened,<END>
and,if,he,liked,a,person,and,he,seemed,to,like,so,many,people,he,sold,them,lumber,on,credit,without,ever,thinking,to,find,out,if,they,had,money,in,the,bank,or,property,<END>
he,was,as,bad,as,frank,in,that,respect,<END>
but,surely,he,would,learn,<END>
and,while,he,was,learning,she,had,a,fond,and,maternal,indulgence,and,patience,for,his,errors,<END>
every,evening,when,he,called,at,her,house,weary,and,discouraged,she,was,tireless,in,her,tactful,helpful,suggestions,<END>
but,for,all,her,encouragement,and,cheer,there,was,a,queer,dead,look,in,his,eyes,<END>
she,could,not,understand,it,and,it,frightened,her,<END>
he,was,different,so,different,from,the,man,he,used,to,be,<END>
if,only,she,could,see,him,alone,perhaps,she,could,discover,the,reason,<END>
the,situation,gave,her,many,sleepless,nights,<END>
she,worried,about,ashley,both,because,she,knew,he,was,unhappy,and,because,she,knew,his,unhappiness,wasn't,helping,him,to,become,a,good,lumber,dealer,<END>
it,was,a,torture,to,have,her,mills,in,the,hands,of,two,men,with,no,more,business,sense,than,hugh,and,ashley,heartbreaking,to,see,her,competitors,taking,her,best,customers,away,when,she,had,worked,so,hard,and,planned,so,carefully,for,these,helpless,months,<END>
oh,if,she,could,only,get,back,to,work,again,<END>
she,would,take,ashley,in,hand,and,then,he,would,certainly,learn,<END>
and,johnnie,gallegher,could,run,the,other,mill,and,she,could,handle,the,selling,and,then,everything,would,be,fine,<END>
as,for,hugh,he,could,drive,a,delivery,wagon,if,he,still,wanted,to,work,for,her,<END>
that,was,all,he,was,good,for,<END>
of,course,gallegher,looked,like,an,unscrupulous,man,for,all,of,his,smartness,but,who,else,could,she,get,<END>
why,had,the,other,men,who,were,both,smart,and,honest,been,so,perverse,about,working,for,her,<END>
if,she,only,had,one,of,them,working,for,her,now,in,place,of,hugh,she,wouldn't,have,to,worry,so,much,but,<END>
tommy,wellburn,in,spite,of,his,crippled,back,was,the,busiest,contractor,in,town,and,coining,money,so,people,said,<END>
mrs,merriwether,and,rene,were,prospering,and,now,had,opened,a,bakery,downtown,<END>
rene,was,managing,it,with,true,french,thrift,and,grandpa,merriwether,glad,to,escape,from,his,chimney,corner,was,driving,rene's,pie,wagon,<END>
the,simmons,boys,were,so,busy,they,were,operating,their,brick,kiln,with,three,shifts,of,labor,a,day,<END>
and,kells,whiting,was,cleaning,up,money,with,his,hair,straightener,because,he,told,the,negroes,they,wouldn't,ever,be,permitted,to,vote,the,republican,ticket,if,they,had,kinky,hair,<END>
it,was,the,same,with,all,the,smart,young,men,she,knew,the,doctors,the,lawyers,the,storekeepers,<END>
the,apathy,which,had,clutched,them,immediately,after,the,war,had,completely,disappeared,and,they,were,too,busy,building,their,own,fortunes,to,help,her,build,hers,<END>
the,ones,who,were,not,busy,were,the,men,of,hugh's,type,or,ashley's,<END>
what,a,mess,it,was,to,try,to,run,a,business,and,have,a,baby,too,<END>
i'll,never,have,another,one,she,decided,firmly,<END>

i,shall,simply,tell,frank,that,i,won't,have,any,more,children,<END>
frank,wanted,a,big,family,but,she,could,manage,frank,somehow,<END>
her,mind,was,made,up,<END>
this,was,her,last,child,<END>
the,mills,were,far,more,important,<END>
chapter,xlii,<END>
scarlett's,child,was,a,girl,a,small,bald-headed,mite,ugly,as,a,hairless,monkey,and,absurdly,like,frank,<END>
no,one,except,the,doting,father,could,see,anything,beautiful,about,her,but,the,neighbors,were,charitable,enough,to,say,that,all,ugly,babies,turned,out,pretty,eventually,<END>
she,was,named,ella,lorena,ella,for,her,grandmother,ellen,and,lorena,because,it,was,the,most,fashionable,name,of,the,day,for,girls,even,as,robert,e,lee,and,stonewall,jackson,were,popular,for,boys,and,abraham,lincoln,and,emancipation,for,negro,children,<END>
she,was,born,in,the,middle,of,a,week,when,frenzied,excitement,gripped,atlanta,and,the,air,was,tense,with,expectation,of,disaster,<END>
a,negro,who,had,boasted,of,rape,had,actually,been,arrested,but,before,he,could,be,brought,to,trial,the,jail,had,been,raided,by,the,ku,klux,klan,and,he,had,been,quietly,hanged,<END>
the,klan,had,acted,to,save,the,as,yet,unnamed,victim,from,having,to,testify,in,open,court,<END>
rather,than,have,her,appear,and,advertise,her,shame,her,father,and,brother,would,have,shot,her,so,lynching,the,negro,seemed,a,sensible,solution,to,the,townspeople,in,fact,the,only,decent,solution,possible,<END>
but,the,military,authorities,were,in,a,fury,<END>
they,saw,no,reason,why,the,girl,should,mind,testifying,publicly,<END>
the,soldiers,made,arrests,right,and,left,swearing,to,wipe,out,the,klan,if,they,had,to,put,every,white,man,in,atlanta,in,jail,<END>
the,negroes,frightened,and,sullen,muttered,of,retaliatory,house,burnings,<END>
the,air,was,thick,with,rumors,of,wholesale,hangings,by,the,yankees,should,the,guilty,parties,be,found,and,of,a,concerted,uprising,against,the,whites,by,the,negroes,<END>
the,people,of,the,town,stayed,at,home,behind,locked,doors,and,shuttered,windows,the,men,fearing,to,go,to,their,businesses,and,leave,their,women,and,children,unprotected,<END>
scarlett,lying,exhausted,in,bed,feebly,and,silently,thanked,god,that,ashley,had,too,much,sense,to,belong,to,the,klan,and,frank,was,too,old,and,poor,spirited,<END>
how,dreadful,it,would,be,to,know,that,the,yankees,might,swoop,down,and,arrest,them,at,any,minute,<END>
why,didn't,the,crack-brained,young,fools,in,the,klan,leave,bad,enough,alone,and,not,stir,up,the,yankees,like,this,<END>
probably,the,girl,hadn't,been,raped,after,all,<END>
probably,she'd,just,been,frightened,silly,and,because,of,her,a,lot,of,men,might,lose,their,lives,<END>
in,this,atmosphere,as,nerve,straining,as,watching,a,slow,fuse,burn,toward,a,barrel,of,gunpowder,scarlett,came,rapidly,back,to,strength,<END>
the,healthy,vigor,which,had,carried,her,through,the,hard,days,at,tara,stood,her,in,good,stead,now,and,within,two,weeks,of,ella,lorena's,birth,she,was,strong,enough,to,sit,up,and,chafe,at,her,inactivity,<END>
in,three,weeks,she,was,up,declaring,she,had,to,see,to,the,mills,<END>
they,were,standing,idle,because,both,hugh,and,ashley,feared,to,leave,their,families,alone,all,day,<END>
then,the,blow,fell,<END>
frank,full,of,the,pride,of,new,fatherhood,summoned,up,courage,enough,to,forbid,scarlett,leaving,the,house,while,conditions,were,so,dangerous,<END>
his,commands,would,not,have,worried,her,at,all,and,she,would,have,gone,about,her,business,in,spite,of,them,if,he,had,not,put,her,horse,and,buggy,in,the,livery,stable,and,ordered,that,they,should,not,be,surrendered,to,anyone,except,himself,<END>
to,make,matters,worse,he,and,mammy,had,patiently,searched,the,house,while,she,was,ill,and,unearthed,her,hidden,store,of,money,<END>
and,frank,had,deposited,it,in,the,bank,in,his,own,name,so,now,she,could,not,even,hire,a,rig,<END>
scarlett,raged,at,both,frank,and,mammy,then,was,reduced,to,begging,and,finally,cried,all,one,morning,like,a,furious,thwarted,child,<END>
but,for,all,her,pains,she,heard,only,there,sugar,<END>
you're,just,a,sick,little,girl,<END>
and,miss,scarlett,ef,you,doan,quit,cahyin',on,so,you,gwine,sour,yo',milk,an',de,baby,have,colic,sho,as,gun's,iron,<END>
in,a,furious,temper,scarlett,charged,through,her,back,yard,to,melanie's,house,and,there,unburdened,herself,at,the,top,of,her,voice,declaring,she,would,walk,to,the,mills,she,would,go,about,atlanta,telling,everyone,what,a,varmint,she,had,married,she,would,not,be,treated,like,a,naughty,simple-minded,child,<END>
she,would,carry,a,pistol,and,shoot,anyone,who,threatened,her,<END>
she,had,shot,one,man,and,she,would,love,yes,love,to,shoot,another,<END>
she,would,<END>
melanie,who,feared,to,venture,onto,her,own,front,porch,was,appalled,by,such,threats,<END>
oh,you,must,not,risk,yourself,<END>
i,should,die,if,anything,happened,to,you,<END>
oh,please,<END>
i,will,<END>
i,will,<END>
i,will,walk,<END>
melanie,looked,at,her,and,saw,that,this,was,not,the,hysteria,of,a,woman,still,weak,from,childbirth,<END>
there,was,the,same,breakneck,headlong,determination,in,scarlett's,face,that,melanie,had,often,seen,in,gerald,o'hara's,face,when,his,mind,was,made,up,<END>
she,put,her,arms,around,scarlett's,waist,and,held,her,tightly,<END>
it's,all,my,fault,for,not,being,brave,like,you,and,for,keeping,ashley,at,home,with,me,all,this,time,when,he,should,have,been,at,the,mill,<END>
oh,dear,<END>
i'm,such,a,ninny,<END>
darling,i'll,tell,ashley,i'm,not,a,bit,frightened,and,i'll,come,over,and,stay,with,you,and,aunt,pitty,and,he,can,go,back,to,work,and,<END>
not,even,to,herself,would,scarlett,admit,that,she,did,not,think,ashley,could,cope,with,the,situation,alone,and,she,shouted,you'll,do,nothing,of,the,kind,<END>
what,earthly,good,would,ashley,do,at,work,if,he,was,worried,about,you,every,minute,<END>
everybody,is,just,so,hateful,<END>
even,uncle,peter,refuses,to,go,out,with,me,<END>
but,i,don't,care,<END>
i'll,go,alone,<END>
i'll,walk,every,step,of,the,way,and,pick,up,a,crew,of,darkies,somewhere,<END>
oh,no,<END>
you,mustn't,do,that,<END>
something,dreadful,might,happen,to,you,<END>
they,say,that,shantytown,settlement,on,the,decatur,road,is,just,full,of,mean,darkies,and,you'd,have,to,pass,right,by,it,<END>
let,me,think,darling,promise,me,you,won't,do,anything,today,and,i'll,think,of,something,<END>
promise,me,you'll,go,home,and,lie,down,<END>
you,look,right,peaked,<END>
promise,me,<END>
because,she,was,too,exhausted,by,her,anger,to,do,otherwise,scarlett,sulkily,promised,and,went,home,haughtily,refusing,any,overtures,of,peace,from,her,household,<END>
that,afternoon,a,strange,figure,stumped,through,melanie's,hedge,and,across,pitty's,back,yard,<END>
obviously,he,was,one,of,those,men,whom,mammy,and,dilcey,referred,to,as,de,riff-raff,whut,miss,melly,pick,up,off,de,streets,an',let,sleep,in,her,cellar,<END>
there,were,three,rooms,in,the,basement,of,melanie's,house,which,formerly,had,been,servants',quarters,and,a,wine,room,<END>
now,dilcey,occupied,one,and,the,other,two,were,in,constant,use,by,a,stream,of,miserable,and,ragged,transients,<END>
no,one,but,melanie,knew,whence,they,came,or,where,they,were,going,and,no,one,but,she,knew,where,she,collected,them,<END>
perhaps,the,negroes,were,right,and,she,did,pick,them,up,from,the,streets,<END>
but,even,as,the,great,and,the,near,great,gravitated,to,her,small,parlor,so,unfortunates,found,their,way,to,her,cellar,where,they,were,fed,bedded,and,sent,on,their,way,with,packages,of,food,<END>
usually,the,occupants,of,the,rooms,were,former,confederate,soldiers,of,the,rougher,illiterate,type,homeless,men,men,without,families,beating,their,way,about,the,country,in,hope,of,finding,work,<END>
frequently,brown,and,withered,country,women,with,broods,of,tow-,haired,silent,children,spent,the,night,there,women,widowed,by,the,war,dispossessed,of,their,farms,seeking,relatives,who,were,scattered,and,lost,<END>
sometimes,the,neighborhood,was,scandalized,by,the,presence,of,foreigners,speaking,little,or,no,english,who,had,been,drawn,south,by,glowing,tales,of,fortunes,easily,made,<END>
once,a,republican,had,slept,there,<END>
at,least,mammy,insisted,he,was,a,republican,saying,she,could,smell,a,republican,same,as,a,horse,could,smell,a,rattlesnake,but,no,one,believed,mammy's,story,for,there,must,be,some,limit,even,to,melanie's,charity,<END>
at,least,everyone,hoped,so,<END>
yes,thought,scarlett,sitting,on,the,side,porch,in,the,pale,november,sunshine,with,the,baby,on,her,lap,he,is,one,of,melanie's,lame,dogs,<END>
and,he's,really,lame,at,that,<END>
the,man,who,was,making,his,way,across,the,back,yard,stumped,like,will,benteen,on,a,wooden,leg,<END>
he,was,a,tall,thin,old,man,with,a,bald,head,which,shone,pinkishly,dirty,and,a,grizzled,beard,so,long,he,could,tuck,it,in,his,belt,<END>
he,was,over,sixty,to,judge,by,his,hard,seamed,face,but,there,was,no,sag,of,age,to,his,body,<END>
he,was,lank,and,ungainly,but,even,with,his,wooden,peg,he,moved,as,swiftly,as,a,snake,<END>
he,mounted,the,steps,and,came,toward,her,and,even,before,he,spoke,revealing,in,his,tones,a,twang,and,a,burring,of,r,s,unusual,in,the,lowlands,scarlett,knew,that,he,was,mountain,born,<END>
for,all,his,dirty,ragged,clothes,there,was,about,him,as,about,most,mountaineers,an,air,of,fierce,silent,pride,that,permitted,no,liberties,and,tolerated,no,foolishness,<END>
his,beard,was,stained,with,tobacco,juice,and,a,large,wad,in,his,jaw,made,his,face,look,deformed,<END>
his,nose,was,thin,and,craggy,his,eyebrows,bushy,and,twisted,into,witches',locks,and,a,lush,growth,of,hair,sprang,from,his,ears,giving,them,the,tufted,look,of,a,lynx's,ears,<END>
beneath,his,brow,was,one,hollow,socket,from,which,a,scar,ran,down,his,cheek,carving,a,diagonal,line,through,his,beard,<END>
the,other,eye,was,small,pale,and,cold,an,unwinking,and,remorseless,eye,<END>
there,was,a,heavy,pistol,openly,in,his,trouser,band,and,from,the,top,of,his,tattered,boot,protruded,the,hilt,of,a,bowie,knife,<END>
he,returned,scarlett's,stare,coldly,and,spat,across,the,rail,of,the,banister,before,he,spoke,<END>
there,was,contempt,in,his,one,eye,not,a,personal,contempt,for,her,but,for,her,whole,sex,<END>
miz,wilkes,sont,me,to,work,for,you,he,said,shortly,<END>

but,began,scarlett,helplessly,and,then,she,stopped,and,looked,at,him,<END>
after,a,moment,she,began,to,smile,<END>
she,didn't,like,the,looks,of,this,elderly,desperado,but,his,presence,would,simplify,matters,<END>
with,him,beside,her,she,could,go,to,town,drive,to,the,mills,call,on,customers,<END>
no,one,could,doubt,her,safety,with,him,and,his,very,appearance,was,enough,to,keep,from,giving,rise,to,scandal,<END>
it's,a,bargain,she,said,<END>
that,is,if,my,husband,agrees,<END>
after,a,private,conversation,with,archie,frank,gave,his,reluctant,approval,and,sent,word,to,the,livery,stable,to,release,the,horse,and,buggy,<END>
he,was,hurt,and,disappointed,that,motherhood,had,not,changed,scarlett,as,he,had,hoped,it,would,but,if,she,was,determined,to,go,back,to,her,damnable,mills,then,archie,was,a,godsend,<END>
so,began,the,relationship,that,at,first,startled,atlanta,<END>
archie,and,scarlett,were,a,queerly,assorted,pair,the,truculent,dirty,old,man,with,his,wooden,peg,sticking,stiffly,out,over,the,dashboard,and,the,pretty,neatly,dressed,young,woman,with,forehead,puckered,in,an,abstracted,frown,<END>
they,could,be,seen,at,all,hours,and,at,all,places,in,and,near,atlanta,seldom,speaking,to,each,other,obviously,disliking,each,other,but,bound,together,by,mutual,need,he,of,money,she,of,protection,<END>
at,least,said,the,ladies,of,the,town,it's,better,than,riding,around,so,brazenly,with,that,butler,man,<END>
they,wondered,curiously,where,rhett,was,these,days,for,he,had,abruptly,left,town,three,months,before,and,no,one,not,even,scarlett,knew,where,he,was,<END>
archie,was,a,silent,man,never,speaking,unless,spoken,to,and,usually,answering,with,grunts,<END>
every,morning,he,came,from,melanie's,cellar,and,sat,on,the,front,steps,of,pitty's,house,chewing,and,spitting,until,scarlett,came,out,and,peter,brought,the,buggy,from,the,stable,<END>
uncle,peter,feared,him,only,a,little,less,than,the,devil,or,the,ku,klux,and,even,mammy,walked,silently,and,timorously,around,him,<END>
he,hated,negroes,and,they,knew,it,and,feared,him,<END>
he,reinforced,his,pistol,and,knife,with,another,pistol,and,his,fame,spread,far,among,the,black,population,<END>
he,never,once,had,to,draw,a,pistol,or,even,lay,his,hand,on,his,belt,<END>
the,moral,effect,was,sufficient,<END>
no,negro,dared,even,laugh,while,archie,was,in,hearing,<END>
once,scarlett,asked,him,curiously,why,he,hated,negroes,and,was,surprised,when,he,answered,for,generally,all,questions,were,answered,by,i,reckon,that's,my,bizness,<END>
i,hates,them,like,all,mountain,folks,hates,them,<END>
we,never,liked,them,and,we,never,owned,none,<END>
it,was,them,niggers,that,started,the,war,<END>
i,hates,them,for,that,too,<END>
but,you,fought,in,the,war,<END>
i,reckon,that's,a,man's,privilege,<END>
i,hates,yankees,too,more'n,i,hates,niggers,<END>
most,as,much,as,i,hates,talkative,women,<END>
it,was,such,outspoken,rudeness,as,this,that,threw,scarlett,into,silent,furies,and,made,her,long,to,be,rid,of,him,<END>
but,how,could,she,do,without,him,<END>
in,what,other,way,could,she,obtain,such,freedom,<END>
he,was,rude,and,dirty,and,occasionally,very,odorous,but,he,served,his,purpose,<END>
he,drove,her,to,and,from,the,mills,and,on,her,round,of,customers,spitting,and,staring,off,into,space,while,she,talked,and,gave,orders,<END>
if,she,climbed,down,from,the,buggy,he,climbed,after,her,and,dogged,her,footsteps,<END>
when,she,was,among,rough,laborers,negroes,or,yankee,soldiers,he,was,seldom,more,than,a,pace,from,her,elbow,<END>
soon,atlanta,became,accustomed,to,seeing,scarlett,and,her,bodyguard,and,from,being,accustomed,the,ladies,grew,to,envy,her,her,freedom,of,movement,<END>
since,the,ku,klux,lynching,the,ladies,had,been,practically,immured,not,even,going,to,town,to,shop,unless,there,were,half,a,dozen,in,their,group,<END>
naturally,social,minded,they,became,restless,and,putting,their,pride,in,their,pockets,they,began,to,beg,the,loan,of,archie,from,scarlett,<END>
and,whenever,she,did,not,need,him,she,was,gracious,enough,to,spare,him,for,the,use,of,other,ladies,<END>
soon,archie,became,an,atlanta,institution,and,the,ladies,competed,for,his,free,time,<END>
there,was,seldom,a,morning,when,a,child,or,a,negro,servant,did,not,arrive,at,breakfast,time,with,a,note,saying,if,you,aren't,using,archie,this,afternoon,do,let,me,have,him,<END>
i,want,to,drive,to,the,cemetery,with,flowers,<END>
i,must,go,to,the,milliners,<END>
i,should,like,archie,to,drive,aunt,nelly,for,an,airing,<END>
i,must,go,calling,on,peters,street,and,grandpa,is,not,feeling,well,enough,to,take,me,<END>
could,archie,<END>
he,drove,them,all,maids,matrons,and,widows,and,toward,all,he,evidenced,the,same,uncompromising,contempt,<END>
it,was,obvious,that,he,did,not,like,women,melanie,excepted,any,better,than,he,liked,negroes,and,yankees,<END>
shocked,at,first,by,his,rudeness,the,ladies,finally,became,accustomed,to,him,and,as,he,was,so,silent,except,for,intermittent,explosions,of,tobacco,juice,they,took,him,as,much,for,granted,as,the,horses,he,drove,and,forgot,his,very,existence,<END>
in,fact,mrs,merriwether,related,to,mrs,meade,the,complete,details,of,her,niece's,confinement,before,she,even,remembered,archie's,presence,on,the,front,seat,of,the,carriage,<END>
at,no,other,time,than,this,could,such,a,situation,have,been,possible,<END>
before,the,war,he,would,not,have,been,permitted,even,in,the,ladies',kitchens,<END>
they,would,have,handed,him,food,through,the,back,door,and,sent,him,about,his,business,<END>
but,now,they,welcomed,his,reassuring,presence,<END>
rude,illiterate,dirty,he,was,a,bulwark,between,the,ladies,and,the,terrors,of,reconstruction,<END>
he,was,neither,friend,nor,servant,<END>
he,was,a,hired,bodyguard,protecting,the,women,while,their,men,worked,by,day,or,were,absent,from,home,at,night,<END>
it,seemed,to,scarlett,that,after,archie,came,to,work,for,her,frank,was,away,at,night,very,frequently,<END>
he,said,the,books,at,the,store,had,to,be,balanced,and,business,was,brisk,enough,now,to,give,him,little,time,to,attend,to,this,in,working,hours,<END>
and,there,were,sick,friends,with,whom,he,had,to,sit,<END>
then,there,was,the,organization,of,democrats,who,forgathered,every,wednesday,night,to,devise,ways,of,regaining,the,ballot,and,frank,never,missed,a,meeting,<END>
scarlett,thought,this,organization,did,little,else,except,argue,the,merits,of,general,john,b,gordon,over,every,other,general,except,general,lee,and,refight,the,war,<END>
certainly,she,could,observe,no,progress,in,the,direction,of,the,recovery,of,the,ballot,<END>
but,frank,evidently,enjoyed,the,meetings,for,he,stayed,out,until,all,hours,on,those,nights,<END>
ashley,also,sat,up,with,the,sick,and,he,too,attended,the,democratic,meetings,and,he,was,usually,away,on,the,same,nights,as,frank,<END>
on,these,nights,archie,escorted,pitty,scarlett,wade,and,little,ella,though,the,back,yard,to,melanie's,house,and,the,two,families,spent,the,evenings,together,<END>
the,ladies,sewed,while,archie,lay,full,length,on,the,parlor,sofa,snoring,his,gray,whiskers,fluttering,at,each,rumble,<END>
no,one,had,invited,him,to,dispose,himself,on,the,sofa,and,as,it,was,the,finest,piece,of,furniture,in,the,house,the,ladies,secretly,moaned,every,time,he,lay,down,on,it,planting,his,boot,on,the,pretty,upholstery,<END>
but,none,of,them,had,the,courage,to,remonstrate,with,him,<END>
especially,after,he,remarked,that,it,was,lucky,he,went,to,sleep,easy,for,otherwise,the,sound,of,women,clattering,like,a,flock,of,guinea,hens,would,certainly,drive,him,crazy,<END>
scarlett,sometimes,wondered,where,archie,had,come,from,and,what,his,life,had,been,before,he,came,to,live,in,melly's,cellar,but,she,asked,no,questions,<END>
there,was,that,about,his,grim,one-eyed,face,which,discouraged,curiosity,<END>
all,she,knew,was,that,his,voice,bespoke,the,mountains,to,the,north,and,that,he,had,been,in,the,army,and,had,lost,both,leg,and,eye,shortly,before,the,surrender,<END>
it,was,words,spoken,in,a,fit,of,anger,against,hugh,elsing,which,brought,out,the,truth,of,archie's,past,<END>
one,morning,the,old,man,had,driven,her,to,hugh's,mill,and,she,had,found,it,idle,the,negroes,gone,and,hugh,sitting,despondently,under,a,tree,<END>
his,crew,had,not,made,their,appearance,that,morning,and,he,was,at,a,loss,as,to,what,to,do,<END>
scarlett,was,in,a,furious,temper,and,did,not,scruple,to,expend,it,on,hugh,for,she,had,just,received,an,order,for,a,large,amount,of,lumber,a,rush,order,at,that,<END>
she,had,used,energy,and,charm,and,bargaining,to,get,that,order,and,now,the,mill,was,quiet,<END>
drive,me,out,to,the,other,mill,she,directed,archie,<END>
yes,i,know,it'll,take,a,long,time,and,we,won't,get,any,dinner,but,what,am,i,paying,you,for,<END>
i'll,have,to,make,mr,wilkes,stop,what,he's,doing,and,run,me,off,this,lumber,<END>
like,as,not,his,crew,won't,be,working,either,<END>
great,balls,of,fire,<END>
i,never,saw,such,a,nincompoop,as,hugh,elsing,<END>

what,do,i,care,if,gallegher,was,in,the,yankee,army,<END>
he'll,work,<END>
i,never,saw,a,lazy,irishman,yet,<END>
and,i'm,through,with,free,issue,darkies,<END>

i'm,going,to,get,johnnie,gallegher,and,lease,me,some,convicts,<END>
he'll,get,work,out,of,them,<END>

archie,turned,to,her,his,eye,malevolent,and,when,he,spoke,there,was,cold,anger,in,his,rusty,voice,<END>
the,day,you,gits,convicts,is,the,day,i,quits,you,he,said,<END>

i,reckon,said,archie,laconically,and,after,a,pause,i,was,a,convict,for,nigh,on,to,forty,years,<END>
scarlett,gasped,and,for,a,moment,shrank,back,against,the,cushions,<END>
this,then,was,the,answer,to,the,riddle,of,archie,his,unwillingness,to,tell,his,last,name,or,the,place,of,his,birth,or,any,scrap,of,his,past,life,the,answer,to,the,difficulty,with,which,he,spoke,and,his,cold,hatred,of,the,world,<END>

scarlett's,eyelids,batted,rapidly,with,fright,<END>
the,mouth,beneath,the,beard,seemed,to,move,as,if,he,were,smiling,grimly,at,her,fear,<END>

you,might,call,it,a,pardon,<END>
his,thick,gray,brows,writhed,together,as,though,the,effort,of,stringing,words,together,was,difficult,<END>
'long,in,'sixty-four,when,sherman,come,through,i,was,at,milledgeville,jail,like,i,had,been,for,forty,years,<END>

now,if,thar's,one,thing,i,hates,worse,than,a,nigger,or,a,woman,it's,a,yankee,<END>

what,was,they,doin',in,georgia,freein',our,niggers,and,burnin',our,houses,and,killin',our,stock,<END>
well,the,warden,he,said,the,army,needed,more,soldiers,bad,and,any,of,us,who'd,jine,up,would,be,free,at,the,end,of,the,war,if,we,come,out,alive,<END>
but,us,lifers,us,murderers,the,warden,he,said,the,army,didn't,want,us,<END>
we,was,to,be,sont,somewheres,else,to,another,jail,<END>

i'm,just,in,for,killin',my,wife,and,she,needed,killin',<END>
and,i,wants,to,fight,the,yankees,<END>
and,the,warden,he,saw,my,side,of,it,and,he,slipped,me,out,with,the,other,prisoners,<END>
he,paused,and,grunted,<END>
huh,<END>
that,was,right,funny,<END>
they,put,me,in,jail,for,killin',and,they,let,me,out,with,a,gun,in,my,hand,and,a,free,pardon,to,do,more,killin',<END>
it,shore,was,good,to,be,a,free,man,with,a,rifle,in,my,hand,again,<END>
us,men,from,milledgeville,did,good,fightin',and,killin',and,a,lot,of,us,was,kilt,<END>

and,when,the,surrender,come,we,was,free,<END>
i,lost,this,here,leg,and,this,here,eye,<END>
but,i,ain't,sorry,<END>
oh,said,scarlett,weakly,<END>
she,tried,to,remember,what,she,had,heard,about,the,releasing,of,the,milledgeville,convicts,in,that,last,desperate,effort,to,stem,the,tide,of,sherman's,army,<END>
frank,had,mentioned,it,that,christmas,of,1864,what,had,he,said,<END>
but,her,memories,of,that,time,were,too,chaotic,<END>
again,she,felt,the,wild,terror,of,those,days,heard,the,siege,guns,saw,the,line,of,wagons,dripping,blood,into,the,red,roads,saw,the,home,guard,marching,off,the,little,cadets,and,the,children,like,phil,meade,and,the,old,men,like,uncle,henry,and,grandpa,merriwether,<END>
and,the,convicts,had,marched,out,too,to,die,in,the,twilight,of,the,confederacy,to,freeze,in,the,snow,and,sleet,of,that,last,campaign,in,tennessee,<END>
for,a,brief,moment,she,thought,what,a,fool,this,old,man,was,to,fight,for,a,state,which,had,taken,forty,years,from,his,life,<END>
georgia,had,taken,his,youth,and,his,middle,years,for,a,crime,that,was,no,crime,to,him,yet,he,had,freely,given,a,leg,and,an,eye,to,georgia,<END>
the,bitter,words,rhett,had,spoken,in,the,early,days,of,the,war,came,back,to,her,and,she,remembered,him,saying,he,would,never,fight,for,a,society,that,had,made,him,an,outcast,<END>
but,when,the,emergency,had,arisen,he,had,gone,off,to,fight,for,that,same,society,even,as,archie,had,done,<END>
it,seemed,to,her,that,all,southern,men,high,or,low,were,sentimental,fools,and,cared,less,for,their,hides,than,for,words,which,had,no,meaning,<END>
she,looked,at,archie's,gnarled,old,hands,his,two,pistols,and,his,knife,and,fear,pricked,her,again,<END>
were,there,other,ex-convicts,at,large,like,archie,murderers,desperadoes,thieves,pardoned,for,their,crimes,in,the,name,of,the,confederacy,<END>
why,any,stranger,on,the,street,might,be,a,murderer,<END>
if,frank,ever,learned,the,truth,about,archie,there,would,be,the,devil,to,pay,<END>
or,if,aunt,pitty,but,the,shock,would,kill,pitty,<END>
and,as,for,melanie,scarlett,almost,wished,she,could,tell,melanie,the,truth,about,archie,<END>
it,would,serve,her,right,for,picking,up,trash,and,foisting,it,off,on,her,friends,and,relatives,<END>
i'm,i'm,glad,you,told,me,archie,<END>
i,i,won't,tell,anyone,<END>
it,would,be,a,great,shock,to,mrs,wilkes,and,the,other,ladies,if,they,knew,<END>

miz,wilkes,knows,<END>
i,told,her,the,night,she,fuss,let,me,sleep,in,her,cellar,<END>
you,don't,think,i'd,let,a,nice,lady,like,her,take,me,into,her,house,not,knowin',<END>

melanie,knew,this,man,was,a,murderer,and,a,woman,murderer,at,that,and,she,hadn't,ejected,him,from,her,house,<END>
she,had,trusted,her,son,with,him,and,her,aunt,and,sister-in-law,and,all,her,friends,<END>

miz,wilkes,is,right,sensible,for,a,woman,<END>
she,'lowed,that,i,was,all,right,<END>
she,'lowed,that,a,liar,allus,kept,on,lyin',and,a,thief,kept,on,stealin',but,folks,don't,do,more'n,one,murder,in,a,lifetime,<END>
and,she,reckoned,as,how,anybody,who'd,fought,for,the,confederacy,had,wiped,out,anything,bad,they'd,done,<END>
though,i,don't,hold,that,i,done,nothin',bad,killin',my,wife,<END>

scarlett,made,no,reply,but,she,thought,<END>
the,sooner,you,quit,me,the,better,it,will,suit,me,<END>
a,murderer,<END>
how,could,melly,have,been,so,so,well,there,was,no,word,for,melanie's,action,in,taking,in,this,old,ruffian,and,not,telling,her,friends,he,was,a,jailbird,<END>
so,service,in,the,army,wiped,out,past,sins,<END>
melanie,had,that,mixed,up,with,baptism,<END>
but,then,melly,was,utterly,silly,about,the,confederacy,its,veterans,and,anything,pertaining,to,them,<END>
scarlett,silently,damned,the,yankees,and,added,another,mark,on,her,score,against,them,<END>
they,were,responsible,for,a,situation,that,forced,a,woman,to,keep,a,murderer,at,her,side,to,protect,her,<END>
driving,home,with,archie,in,the,chill,twilight,scarlett,saw,a,clutter,of,saddle,horses,buggies,and,wagons,outside,the,girl,of,the,period,saloon,<END>

grandpa,merriwether's,pie,wagon,was,in,the,center,of,the,tangle,and,as,she,came,closer,scarlett,saw,that,tommy,wellburn,and,uncle,henry,hamilton,were,crowded,on,the,seat,with,him,<END>
i,wish,thought,scarlett,irritably,that,uncle,henry,wouldn't,ride,home,in,that,contraption,<END>
he,ought,to,be,ashamed,to,be,seen,in,it,<END>
it,isn't,as,though,he,didn't,have,a,horse,of,his,own,<END>
he,just,does,it,so,he,and,grandpa,can,go,to,the,saloon,together,every,night,<END>
as,she,came,abreast,the,crowd,something,of,their,tenseness,reached,her,insensitive,though,she,was,and,made,fear,clutch,at,her,heart,<END>
oh,<END>

i,hope,no,one,else,has,been,raped,<END>
if,the,ku,klux,lynch,just,one,more,darky,the,yankees,will,wipe,us,out,<END>

pull,up,<END>
good,evening,everybody,<END>
ashley,uncle,henry,is,something,wrong,<END>
you,all,look,so,<END>
the,crowd,turned,to,her,tipping,their,hats,and,smiling,but,there,was,a,driving,excitement,in,their,eyes,<END>
something's,right,and,something's,wrong,barked,uncle,henry,<END>
depends,on,how,you,look,at,it,<END>
the,way,i,figure,is,the,legislature,couldn't,have,done,different,<END>
the,legislature,<END>
thought,scarlett,in,relief,<END>
she,had,little,interest,in,the,legislature,feeling,that,its,doings,could,hardly,affect,her,<END>
it,was,the,prospect,of,the,yankee,soldiers,on,a,rampage,again,that,frightened,her,<END>
what's,the,legislature,been,up,to,now,<END>
they've,flatly,refused,to,ratify,the,amendment,said,grandpa,merriwether,and,there,was,pride,in,his,voice,<END>
that'll,show,the,yankees,<END>
and,there'll,be,hell,to,pay,for,it,i,beg,your,pardon,scarlett,said,ashley,<END>
oh,the,amendment,<END>
questioned,scarlett,trying,to,look,intelligent,<END>
politics,were,beyond,her,and,she,seldom,wasted,time,thinking,about,them,<END>
there,had,been,a,thirteenth,amendment,ratified,sometime,before,or,maybe,it,had,been,the,sixteenth,amendment,but,what,ratification,meant,she,had,no,idea,<END>
men,were,always,getting,excited,about,such,things,<END>
something,of,her,lack,of,comprehension,showed,in,her,face,and,ashley,smiled,<END>
it's,the,amendment,letting,the,darkies,vote,you,know,he,explained,<END>
it,was,submitted,to,the,legislature,and,they,refused,to,ratify,it,<END>
how,silly,of,them,<END>
you,know,the,yankees,are,going,to,force,it,down,our,throats,<END>
that's,what,i,meant,by,saying,there'd,be,hell,to,pay,said,ashley,<END>
i'm,proud,of,the,legislature,proud,of,their,gumption,<END>
shouted,uncle,henry,<END>
the,yankees,can't,force,it,down,our,throats,if,we,won't,have,it,<END>
they,can,and,they,will,<END>
ashley's,voice,was,calm,but,there,was,worry,in,his,eyes,<END>
and,it'll,make,things,just,that,much,harder,for,us,<END>
oh,ashley,surely,not,<END>
things,couldn't,be,any,harder,than,they,are,now,<END>
yes,things,can,get,worse,even,worse,than,they,are,now,<END>
suppose,we,have,a,darky,legislature,<END>
a,darky,governor,<END>
suppose,we,have,a,worse,military,rule,than,we,now,have,<END>
scarlett's,eyes,grew,large,with,fear,as,some,understanding,entered,her,mind,<END>
i've,been,trying,to,think,what,would,be,best,for,georgia,best,for,all,of,us,<END>
ashley's,face,was,drawn,<END>
whether,it's,wisest,to,fight,this,thing,like,the,legislature,has,done,rouse,the,north,against,us,and,bring,the,whole,yankee,army,on,us,to,cram,the,darky,vote,down,us,whether,we,want,it,or,not,<END>
or,swallow,our,pride,as,best,we,can,submit,gracefully,and,get,the,whole,matter,over,with,as,easily,as,possible,<END>
it,will,amount,to,the,same,thing,in,the,end,<END>
we're,helpless,<END>
we've,got,to,take,the,dose,they're,determined,to,give,us,<END>
maybe,it,would,be,better,for,us,to,take,it,without,kicking,<END>
scarlett,hardly,heard,his,words,certainly,their,full,import,went,over,her,head,<END>
she,knew,that,ashley,as,usual,was,seeing,both,sides,of,a,question,<END>
she,was,seeing,only,one,side,how,this,slap,in,the,yankees',faces,might,affect,her,<END>
going,to,turn,radical,and,vote,the,republican,ticket,ashley,<END>
jeered,grandpa,merriwether,harshly,<END>
there,was,a,tense,silence,<END>
scarlett,saw,archie's,hand,make,a,swift,move,toward,his,pistol,and,then,stop,<END>
archie,thought,and,frequently,said,that,grandpa,was,an,old,bag,of,wind,and,archie,had,no,intention,of,letting,him,insult,miss,melanie's,husband,even,if,miss,melanie's,husband,was,talking,like,a,fool,<END>
the,perplexity,vanished,suddenly,from,ashley's,eyes,and,hot,anger,flared,<END>
but,before,he,could,speak,uncle,henry,charged,grandpa,<END>
you,god,you,blast,i,beg,your,pardon,scarlett,grandpa,you,jackass,don't,you,say,that,to,ashley,<END>
ashley,can,take,care,of,himself,without,you,defending,him,said,grandpa,coldly,<END>
and,he,is,talking,like,a,scallawag,<END>
submit,hell,<END>
i,beg,your,pardon,scarlett,<END>
i,didn't,believe,in,secession,said,ashley,and,his,voice,shook,with,anger,<END>
but,when,georgia,seceded,i,went,with,her,<END>
and,i,didn't,believe,in,war,but,i,fought,in,the,war,<END>
and,i,don't,believe,in,making,the,yankees,madder,than,they,already,are,<END>
but,if,the,legislature,has,decided,to,do,it,i'll,stand,by,the,legislature,<END>
i,<END>
archie,said,uncle,henry,abruptly,drive,miss,scarlett,on,home,<END>
this,isn't,any,place,for,her,<END>
politics,aren't,for,women,folks,anyway,and,there's,going,to,be,cussing,in,a,minute,<END>
go,on,archie,<END>
good,night,scarlett,<END>
as,they,drove,off,down,peachtree,street,scarlett's,heart,was,beating,fast,with,fear,<END>
would,this,foolish,action,of,the,legislature,have,any,effect,on,her,safety,<END>
would,it,so,enrage,the,yankees,that,she,might,lose,her,mills,<END>
well,sir,rumbled,archie,i've,hearn,tell,of,rabbits,spittin',in,bulldogs',faces,but,i,ain't,never,seen,it,till,now,<END>
them,legislatures,might,just,as,well,have,hollered,'hurray,for,jeff,davis,and,the,southern,confederacy',for,all,the,good,it'll,do,them,and,us,<END>
them,nigger-lovin',yankees,have,made,up,their,mind,to,make,the,niggers,our,bosses,<END>
but,you,got,to,admire,them,legislatures',sperrit,<END>
admire,them,<END>
great,balls,of,fire,<END>
admire,them,<END>
they,ought,to,be,shot,<END>
it'll,bring,the,yankees,down,on,us,like,a,duck,on,a,june,bug,<END>
why,couldn't,they,have,rati,radi,whatever,they,were,supposed,to,do,to,it,and,smoothed,the,yankees,down,instead,of,stirring,them,up,again,<END>
they're,going,to,make,us,knuckle,under,and,we,may,as,well,knuckle,now,as,later,<END>
archie,fixed,her,with,a,cold,eye,<END>
knuckle,under,without,a,fight,<END>
women,ain't,got,no,more,pride,than,goats,<END>
when,scarlett,leased,ten,convicts,five,for,each,of,her,mills,archie,made,good,his,threat,and,refused,to,have,anything,further,to,do,with,her,<END>
not,all,melanie's,pleading,or,frank's,promises,of,higher,pay,would,induce,him,to,take,up,the,reins,again,<END>
he,willingly,escorted,melanie,and,pitty,and,india,and,their,friends,about,the,town,but,not,scarlett,<END>
he,would,not,even,drive,for,the,other,ladies,if,scarlett,was,in,the,carriage,<END>
it,was,an,embarrassing,situation,having,the,old,desperado,sitting,in,judgment,upon,her,and,it,was,still,more,embarrassing,to,know,that,her,family,and,friends,agreed,with,the,old,man,<END>
frank,pleaded,with,her,against,taking,the,step,<END>
ashley,at,first,refused,to,work,convicts,and,was,persuaded,against,his,will,only,after,tears,and,supplications,and,promises,that,when,times,were,better,she,would,hire,free,darkies,<END>
neighbors,were,so,outspoken,in,their,disapproval,that,frank,pitty,and,melanie,found,it,hard,to,hold,up,their,heads,<END>
even,peter,and,mammy,declared,that,it,was,bad,luck,to,work,convicts,and,no,good,would,come,of,it,<END>
everyone,said,it,was,wrong,to,take,advantage,of,the,miseries,and,misfortunes,of,others,<END>
you,didn't,have,any,objections,to,working,slaves,<END>
scarlett,cried,indignantly,<END>
ah,but,that,was,different,<END>
slaves,were,neither,miserable,nor,unfortunate,<END>
the,negroes,were,far,better,off,under,slavery,than,they,were,now,under,freedom,and,if,she,didn't,believe,it,just,look,about,her,<END>
but,as,usual,opposition,had,the,effect,of,making,scarlett,more,determined,on,her,course,<END>
she,removed,hugh,from,the,management,of,the,mill,put,him,to,driving,a,lumber,wagon,and,closed,the,final,details,of,hiring,johnnie,gallegher,<END>
he,seemed,to,be,the,only,person,she,knew,who,approved,of,the,convicts,<END>
he,nodded,his,bullet,head,briefly,and,said,it,was,a,smart,move,<END>
scarlett,looking,at,the,little,ex-jockey,planted,firmly,on,his,short,bowed,legs,his,gnomish,face,hard,and,businesslike,thought,whoever,let,him,ride,their,horses,didn't,care,much,for,horse,flesh,<END>
i,wouldn't,let,him,get,within,ten,feet,of,any,horse,of,mine,<END>
but,she,had,no,qualms,in,trusting,him,with,a,convict,gang,<END>
and,i'm,to,have,a,free,hand,with,the,gang,<END>
he,questioned,his,eyes,as,cold,as,gray,agates,<END>
a,free,hand,<END>
all,i,ask,is,that,you,keep,that,mill,running,and,deliver,my,lumber,when,i,want,it,and,as,much,as,i,want,<END>
i'm,your,man,said,johnnie,shortly,<END>
i'll,tell,mr,wellburn,i'm,leaving,him,<END>
as,he,rolled,off,through,the,crowd,of,masons,and,carpenters,and,hod,carriers,scarlett,felt,relieved,and,her,spirits,rose,<END>
johnnie,was,indeed,her,man,<END>
he,was,tough,and,hard,and,there,was,no,nonsense,about,him,<END>
shanty,irish,on,the,make,frank,had,contemptuously,called,him,but,for,that,very,reason,scarlett,valued,him,<END>
she,knew,that,an,irishman,with,a,determination,to,get,somewhere,was,a,valuable,man,to,have,regardless,of,what,his,personal,characteristics,might,be,<END>
and,she,felt,a,closer,kinship,with,him,than,with,many,men,of,her,own,class,for,johnnie,knew,the,value,of,money,<END>
the,first,week,he,took,over,the,mill,he,justified,all,her,hopes,for,he,accomplished,more,with,five,convicts,than,hugh,had,ever,done,with,his,crew,of,ten,free,negroes,<END>
more,than,that,he,gave,scarlett,greater,leisure,than,she,had,had,since,she,came,to,atlanta,the,year,before,because,he,had,no,liking,for,her,presence,at,the,mill,and,said,so,frankly,<END>
you,tend,to,your,end,of,selling,and,let,me,tend,to,my,end,of,lumbering,he,said,shortly,<END>
a,convict,camp,ain't,any,place,for,a,lady,and,if,nobody,else'll,tell,you,so,johnnie,gallegher's,telling,you,now,<END>
i'm,delivering,your,lumber,ain't,i,<END>
well,i've,got,no,notion,to,be,pestered,every,day,like,mr,wilkes,<END>
he,needs,pestering,<END>
i,don't,<END>
so,scarlett,reluctantly,stayed,away,from,johnnie's,mill,fearing,that,if,she,came,too,often,he,might,quit,and,that,would,be,ruinous,<END>
his,remark,that,ashley,needed,pestering,stung,her,for,there,was,more,truth,in,it,than,she,liked,to,admit,<END>
ashley,was,doing,little,better,with,convicts,than,he,had,done,with,free,labor,although,why,he,was,unable,to,tell,<END>
moreover,he,looked,as,if,he,were,ashamed,to,be,working,convicts,and,he,had,little,to,say,to,her,these,days,<END>
scarlett,was,worried,by,the,change,that,was,coming,over,him,<END>
there,were,gray,hairs,in,his,bright,head,now,and,a,tired,slump,in,his,shoulders,<END>
and,he,seldom,smiled,<END>
he,no,longer,looked,the,debonaire,ashley,who,had,caught,her,fancy,so,many,years,before,<END>
he,looked,like,a,man,secretly,gnawed,by,a,scarcely,endurable,pain,and,there,was,a,grim,tight,look,about,his,mouth,that,baffled,and,hurt,her,<END>
she,wanted,to,drag,his,head,fiercely,down,on,her,shoulder,stroke,the,graying,hair,and,cry,tell,me,what's,worrying,you,<END>
i'll,fix,it,<END>
i'll,make,it,right,for,you,<END>
but,his,formal,remote,air,kept,her,at,arm's,length,<END>
chapter,xliii,<END>
it,was,one,of,those,rare,december,days,when,the,sun,was,almost,as,warm,as,indian,summer,<END>
dry,red,leaves,still,clung,to,the,oak,in,aunt,pitty's,yard,and,a,faint,yellow,green,still,persisted,in,the,dying,grass,<END>
scarlett,with,the,baby,in,her,arms,stepped,out,onto,the,side,porch,and,sat,down,in,a,rocking,chair,in,a,patch,of,sunshine,<END>
she,was,wearing,a,new,green,challis,dress,trimmed,with,yards,and,yards,of,black,rickrack,braid,and,a,new,lace,house,cap,which,aunt,pitty,had,made,for,her,<END>
both,were,very,becoming,to,her,and,she,knew,it,and,took,great,pleasure,in,them,<END>
how,good,it,was,to,look,pretty,again,after,the,long,months,of,looking,so,dreadful,<END>
as,she,sat,rocking,the,baby,and,humming,to,herself,she,heard,the,sound,of,hooves,coming,up,the,side,street,and,peering,curiously,through,the,tangle,of,dead,vines,on,the,porch,she,saw,rhett,butler,riding,toward,the,house,<END>
he,had,been,away,from,atlanta,for,months,since,just,after,gerald,died,since,long,before,ella,lorena,was,born,<END>
she,had,missed,him,but,she,now,wished,ardently,that,there,was,some,way,to,avoid,seeing,him,<END>
in,fact,the,sight,of,his,dark,face,brought,a,feeling,of,guilty,panic,to,her,breast,<END>
a,matter,in,which,ashley,was,concerned,lay,on,her,conscience,and,she,did,not,wish,to,discuss,it,with,rhett,but,she,knew,he,would,force,the,discussion,no,matter,how,disinclined,she,might,be,<END>
he,drew,up,at,the,gate,and,swung,lightly,to,the,ground,and,she,thought,staring,nervously,at,him,that,he,looked,just,like,an,illustration,in,a,book,wade,was,always,pestering,her,to,read,aloud,<END>
all,he,needs,is,earrings,and,a,cutlass,between,his,teeth,she,thought,<END>
well,pirate,or,no,he's,not,going,to,cut,my,throat,today,if,i,can,help,it,<END>
as,he,came,up,the,walk,she,called,a,greeting,to,him,summoning,her,sweetest,smile,<END>
how,lucky,that,she,had,on,her,new,dress,and,the,becoming,cap,and,looked,so,pretty,<END>
as,his,eyes,went,swiftly,over,her,she,knew,he,thought,her,pretty,too,<END>
a,new,baby,<END>
why,scarlett,this,is,a,surprise,<END>
he,laughed,leaning,down,to,push,the,blanket,away,from,ella,lorena's,small,ugly,face,<END>
don't,be,silly,she,said,blushing,<END>
how,are,you,rhett,<END>
you've,been,away,a,long,time,<END>
so,i,have,<END>
let,me,hold,the,baby,scarlett,<END>
oh,i,know,how,to,hold,babies,<END>
i,have,many,strange,accomplishments,<END>
well,he,certainly,looks,like,frank,<END>
all,except,the,whiskers,but,give,him,time,<END>
i,hope,not,<END>
it's,a,girl,<END>
a,girl,<END>
that's,better,still,<END>
boys,are,such,nuisances,<END>
don't,ever,have,any,more,boys,scarlett,<END>
it,was,on,the,tip,of,her,tongue,to,reply,tartly,that,she,never,intended,to,have,any,more,babies,boys,or,girls,but,she,caught,herself,in,time,and,smiled,casting,about,quickly,in,her,mind,for,some,topic,of,conversation,that,would,put,off,the,bad,moment,when,the,subject,she,feared,would,come,up,for,discussion,<END>
did,you,have,a,nice,trip,rhett,<END>
where,did,you,go,this,time,<END>
oh,cuba,new,orleans,other,places,<END>
here,scarlett,take,the,baby,<END>
she's,beginning,to,slobber,and,i,can't,get,to,my,handkerchief,<END>
she's,a,fine,baby,i'm,sure,but,she's,wetting,my,shirt,bosom,<END>
she,took,the,child,back,into,her,lap,and,rhett,settled,himself,lazily,on,the,banister,and,took,a,cigar,from,a,silver,case,<END>
you,are,always,going,to,new,orleans,she,said,and,pouted,a,little,<END>
and,you,never,will,tell,me,what,you,do,there,<END>
i,am,a,hard-working,man,scarlett,and,perhaps,my,business,takes,me,there,<END>
hard-working,<END>
you,<END>
she,laughed,impertinently,<END>
you,never,worked,in,your,life,<END>
you're,too,lazy,<END>
all,you,ever,do,is,finance,carpetbaggers,in,their,thieving,and,take,half,the,profits,and,bribe,yankee,officials,to,let,you,in,on,schemes,to,rob,us,taxpayers,<END>
he,threw,back,his,head,and,laughed,<END>
and,how,you,would,love,to,have,money,enough,to,bribe,officials,so,you,could,do,likewise,<END>
the,very,idea,she,began,to,ruffle,<END>
but,perhaps,you,will,make,enough,money,to,get,into,bribery,on,a,large,scale,some,day,<END>
maybe,you'll,get,rich,off,those,convicts,you,leased,<END>
oh,she,said,a,little,disconcerted,how,did,you,find,out,about,my,gang,so,soon,<END>
i,arrived,last,night,and,spent,the,evening,in,the,girl,of,the,period,saloon,where,one,hears,all,the,news,of,the,town,<END>
it's,a,clearing,house,for,gossip,<END>
better,than,a,ladies',sewing,circle,<END>
everyone,told,me,that,you'd,leased,a,gang,and,put,that,little,plug-,ugly,gallegher,in,charge,to,work,them,to,death,<END>
that's,a,lie,she,said,angrily,<END>
he,won't,work,them,to,death,<END>
i'll,see,to,that,<END>
will,you,<END>
of,course,i,will,<END>
how,can,you,even,insinuate,such,things,<END>
oh,i,do,beg,your,pardon,mrs,kennedy,<END>
i,know,your,motives,are,always,above,reproach,<END>
however,johnnie,gallegher,is,a,cold,little,bully,if,i,ever,saw,one,<END>
better,watch,him,or,you'll,be,having,trouble,when,the,inspector,comes,around,<END>
you,tend,to,your,business,and,i'll,tend,to,mine,she,said,indignantly,<END>
and,i,don't,want,to,talk,about,convicts,any,more,<END>
everybody's,been,hateful,about,them,<END>
my,gang,is,my,own,business,and,you,haven't,told,me,yet,what,you,do,in,new,orleans,<END>
you,go,there,so,often,that,everybody,says,she,paused,<END>
she,had,not,intended,to,say,so,much,<END>
what,do,they,say,<END>
well,that,you,have,a,sweetheart,there,<END>
that,you,are,going,to,get,married,<END>
are,you,rhett,<END>
she,had,been,curious,about,this,for,so,long,that,she,could,not,refrain,from,asking,the,point-blank,question,<END>
a,queer,little,pang,of,jealousy,jabbed,at,her,at,the,thought,of,rhett,getting,married,although,why,that,should,be,she,did,not,know,<END>
his,bland,eyes,grew,suddenly,alert,and,he,caught,her,gaze,and,held,it,until,a,little,blush,crept,up,into,her,cheeks,<END>
would,it,matter,much,to,you,<END>
well,i,should,hate,to,lose,your,friendship,she,said,primly,and,with,an,attempt,at,disinterestedness,bent,down,to,pull,the,blanket,closer,about,ella,lorena's,head,<END>
he,laughed,suddenly,shortly,and,said,look,at,me,scarlett,<END>
she,looked,up,unwillingly,her,blush,deepening,<END>
you,can,tell,your,curious,friends,that,when,i,marry,it,will,be,because,i,couldn't,get,the,woman,i,wanted,in,any,other,way,<END>
and,i've,never,yet,wanted,a,woman,bad,enough,to,marry,her,<END>
now,she,was,indeed,confused,and,embarrassed,for,she,remembered,the,night,on,this,very,porch,during,the,siege,when,he,had,said,i,am,not,a,marrying,man,and,casually,suggested,that,she,become,his,mistress,remembered,too,the,terrible,day,when,he,was,in,jail,and,was,shamed,by,the,memory,<END>
a,slow,malicious,smile,went,over,his,face,as,he,read,her,eyes,<END>
but,i,will,satisfy,your,vulgar,curiosity,since,you,ask,such,pointed,questions,<END>
it,isn't,a,sweetheart,that,takes,me,to,new,orleans,<END>
it's,a,child,a,little,boy,<END>
a,little,boy,<END>
the,shock,of,this,unexpected,information,wiped,out,her,confusion,<END>
yes,he,is,my,legal,ward,and,i,am,responsible,for,him,<END>
he's,in,school,in,new,orleans,<END>
i,go,there,frequently,to,see,him,<END>
and,take,him,presents,<END>
so,she,thought,that's,how,he,always,knows,what,kind,of,presents,wade,likes,<END>
yes,he,said,shortly,unwillingly,<END>
well,i,never,<END>
is,he,handsome,<END>
too,handsome,for,his,own,good,<END>
is,he,a,nice,little,boy,<END>
no,<END>
he's,a,perfect,hellion,<END>
i,wish,he,had,never,been,born,<END>
boys,are,troublesome,creatures,<END>
is,there,anything,else,you'd,like,to,know,<END>
he,looked,suddenly,angry,and,his,brow,was,dark,as,though,he,already,regretted,speaking,of,the,matter,at,all,<END>
well,not,if,you,don't,want,to,tell,me,any,more,she,said,loftily,though,she,was,burning,for,further,information,<END>
but,i,just,can't,see,you,in,the,role,of,a,guardian,and,she,laughed,hoping,to,disconcert,him,<END>
no,i,don't,suppose,you,can,<END>
your,vision,is,pretty,limited,<END>
he,said,no,more,and,smoked,his,cigar,in,silence,for,a,while,<END>
she,cast,about,for,some,remark,as,rude,as,his,but,could,think,of,none,<END>
i,would,appreciate,it,if,you'd,say,nothing,of,this,to,anyone,he,said,finally,<END>
though,i,suppose,that,asking,a,woman,to,keep,her,mouth,shut,is,asking,the,impossible,<END>
i,can,keep,a,secret,she,said,with,injured,dignity,<END>
can,you,<END>
it's,nice,to,learn,unsuspected,things,about,friends,<END>
now,stop,pouting,scarlett,<END>
i'm,sorry,i,was,rude,but,you,deserved,it,for,prying,<END>
give,me,a,smile,and,let's,be,pleasant,for,a,minute,or,two,before,i,take,up,an,unpleasant,subject,<END>
oh,dear,<END>
she,thought,<END>
now,he's,going,to,talk,about,ashley,and,the,mill,<END>
and,she,hastened,to,smile,and,show,her,dimple,to,divert,him,<END>
where,else,did,you,go,rhett,<END>
you,haven't,been,in,new,orleans,all,this,time,have,you,<END>
no,for,the,last,month,i've,been,in,charleston,<END>
my,father,died,<END>
oh,i'm,sorry,<END>
don't,be,<END>
i'm,sure,he,wasn't,sorry,to,die,and,i'm,sure,i'm,not,sorry,he's,dead,<END>
rhett,what,a,dreadful,thing,to,say,<END>
it,would,be,much,more,dreadful,if,i,pretended,to,be,sorry,when,i,wasn't,wouldn't,it,<END>
there,was,never,any,love,lost,between,us,<END>
i,cannot,remember,when,the,old,gentleman,did,not,disapprove,of,me,<END>
i,was,too,much,like,his,own,father,and,he,disapproved,heartily,of,his,father,<END>
and,as,i,grew,older,his,disapproval,of,me,became,downright,dislike,which,i,admit,i,did,little,to,change,<END>
all,the,things,father,wanted,me,to,do,and,be,were,such,boring,things,<END>
and,finally,he,threw,me,out,into,the,world,without,a,cent,and,no,training,whatsoever,to,be,anything,but,a,charleston,gentleman,a,good,pistol,shot,and,an,excellent,poker,player,<END>
and,he,seemed,to,take,it,as,a,personal,affront,that,i,did,not,starve,but,put,my,poker,playing,to,excellent,advantage,and,supported,myself,royally,by,gambling,<END>
he,was,so,affronted,at,a,butler,becoming,a,gambler,that,when,i,came,home,for,the,first,time,he,forbade,my,mother,to,see,me,<END>
and,all,during,the,war,when,i,was,blockading,out,of,charleston,mother,had,to,lie,and,slip,off,to,see,me,<END>
naturally,that,didn't,increase,my,love,for,him,<END>
oh,i,didn't,know,all,that,<END>
he,was,what,is,pointed,out,as,a,fine,old,gentleman,of,the,old,school,which,means,that,he,was,ignorant,thick,headed,intolerant,and,incapable,of,thinking,along,any,lines,except,what,other,gentlemen,of,the,old,school,thought,<END>
everyone,admired,him,tremendously,for,having,cut,me,off,and,counted,me,as,dead,<END>
'if,thy,right,eye,offend,thee,pluck,it,out,',<END>
i,was,his,right,eye,his,oldest,son,and,he,plucked,me,out,with,a,vengeance,<END>
he,smiled,a,little,his,eyes,hard,with,amused,memory,<END>
well,i,could,forgive,all,that,but,i,can't,forgive,what,he's,done,to,mother,and,my,sister,since,the,war,ended,<END>
they've,been,practically,destitute,<END>
the,plantation,house,was,burned,and,the,rice,fields,have,gone,back,to,marsh,lands,<END>
and,the,town,house,went,for,taxes,and,they've,been,living,in,two,rooms,that,aren't,fit,for,darkies,<END>
i've,sent,money,to,mother,but,father,has,sent,it,back,tainted,money,you,see,and,several,times,i've,gone,to,charleston,and,given,money,on,the,sly,to,my,sister,<END>
but,father,always,found,out,and,raised,merry,hell,with,her,till,her,life,wasn't,worth,living,poor,girl,<END>
and,back,the,money,came,to,me,<END>
i,don't,know,how,they've,lived,<END>
yes,i,do,know,<END>
my,brother's,given,what,he,could,though,he,hasn't,much,to,give,and,he,won't,take,anything,from,me,either,speculator's,money,is,unlucky,money,you,see,<END>
and,the,charity,of,their,friends,<END>
your,aunt,eulalie,she's,been,very,kind,<END>
she's,one,of,mother's,best,friends,you,know,<END>
she's,given,them,clothes,and,good,god,<END>
my,mother,on,charity,<END>
it,was,one,of,the,few,times,she,had,ever,seen,him,with,his,mask,off,his,face,hard,with,honest,hatred,for,his,father,and,distress,for,his,mother,<END>
aunt,'lalie,<END>
but,good,heavens,rhett,she,hasn't,got,anything,much,above,what,i,send,her,<END>
ah,so,that's,where,it,comes,from,<END>
how,ill,bred,of,you,my,dear,to,brag,of,such,a,thing,in,the,face,of,my,humiliation,<END>
you,must,let,me,reimburse,you,<END>
with,pleasure,said,scarlett,her,mouth,suddenly,twisting,into,a,grin,and,he,smiled,back,<END>
ah,scarlett,how,the,thought,of,a,dollar,does,make,your,eyes,sparkle,<END>
are,you,sure,you,haven't,some,scotch,or,perhaps,jewish,blood,as,well,as,irish,<END>
don't,be,hateful,<END>
i,didn't,mean,to,throw,it,in,your,face,about,aunt,'lalie,<END>
but,honestly,she,thinks,i'm,made,of,money,<END>
she's,always,writing,me,for,more,and,god,knows,i've,got,enough,on,my,hands,without,supporting,all,of,charleston,<END>
what,did,your,father,die,of,<END>
genteel,starvation,i,think,and,hope,<END>
it,served,him,right,<END>
he,was,willing,to,let,mother,and,rosemary,starve,with,him,<END>
now,that,he's,dead,i,can,help,them,<END>
i've,bought,them,a,house,on,the,battery,and,they've,servants,to,look,after,them,<END>
but,of,course,they,couldn't,let,it,be,known,that,the,money,came,from,me,<END>
why,not,<END>
my,dear,surely,you,know,charleston,<END>
you've,visited,there,<END>
my,family,may,be,poor,but,they,have,a,position,to,uphold,<END>
and,they,couldn't,uphold,it,if,it,were,known,that,gambling,money,and,speculator's,money,and,carpetbag,money,was,behind,it,<END>
no,they,gave,it,out,that,father,left,an,enormous,life,insurance,that,he'd,beggared,himself,and,starved,himself,to,death,to,keep,up,the,payments,so,that,after,he,died,they'd,be,provided,for,<END>
so,he,is,looked,upon,as,an,even,greater,gentleman,of,the,old,school,than,before,<END>
in,fact,a,martyr,to,his,family,<END>
i,hope,he's,turning,in,his,grave,at,the,knowledge,that,mother,and,rosemary,are,comfortable,now,in,spite,of,his,efforts,<END>
in,a,way,i'm,sorry,he's,dead,because,he,wanted,to,die,was,so,glad,to,die,<END>
why,<END>
oh,he,really,died,when,lee,surrendered,<END>
you,know,the,type,<END>
he,never,could,adjust,himself,to,the,new,times,and,spent,his,time,talking,about,the,good,old,days,<END>
rhett,are,all,old,folks,like,that,<END>
she,was,thinking,of,gerald,and,what,will,had,said,about,him,<END>
heavens,no,<END>
just,look,at,your,uncle,henry,and,that,old,wild,cat,mr,merriwether,just,to,name,two,<END>
they,took,a,new,lease,on,life,when,they,marched,out,with,the,home,guard,and,it,seems,to,me,that,they've,gotten,younger,and,more,peppery,ever,since,<END>
i,met,old,man,merriwether,this,morning,driving,rene's,pie,wagon,and,cursing,the,horse,like,an,army,mule,skinner,<END>
he,told,me,he,felt,ten,years,younger,since,he,escaped,from,the,house,and,his,daughter-in-law's,coddling,and,took,to,driving,the,wagon,<END>
and,your,uncle,henry,enjoys,fighting,the,yankees,in,court,and,out,and,defending,the,widow,and,the,orphan,free,of,charge,i,fear,against,the,carpetbaggers,<END>
if,there,hadn't,been,a,war,he'd,have,retired,long,ago,and,nursed,his,rheumatism,<END>
they're,young,again,because,they,are,of,use,again,and,feel,that,they,are,needed,<END>
and,they,like,this,new,day,that,gives,old,men,another,chance,<END>
but,there,are,plenty,of,people,young,people,who,feel,like,my,father,and,your,father,<END>
they,can't,and,won't,adjust,and,that,brings,me,to,the,unpleasant,subject,i,want,to,discuss,with,you,scarlett,<END>
his,sudden,shift,so,disconcerted,her,that,she,stammered,what,what,and,inwardly,groaned,oh,lord,<END>
now,it's,coming,<END>
i,wonder,if,i,can,butter,him,down,<END>
i,shouldn't,have,expected,either,truth,or,honor,or,fair,dealing,from,you,knowing,you,as,i,do,<END>
but,foolishly,i,trusted,you,<END>
i,don't,know,what,you,mean,<END>
i,think,you,do,<END>
at,any,rate,you,look,very,guilty,<END>
as,i,was,riding,along,ivy,street,a,while,ago,on,my,way,to,call,on,you,who,should,hail,me,from,behind,a,hedge,but,mrs,ashley,wilkes,<END>
of,course,i,stopped,and,chatted,with,her,<END>
indeed,<END>
yes,we,had,an,enjoyable,talk,<END>
she,told,me,she,had,always,wanted,to,let,me,know,how,brave,she,thought,i,was,to,have,struck,a,blow,for,the,confederacy,even,at,the,eleventh,hour,<END>
oh,fiddle-dee-dee,<END>
melly's,a,fool,<END>
she,might,have,died,that,night,because,you,acted,so,heroic,<END>
i,imagine,she,would,have,thought,her,life,given,in,a,good,cause,<END>
and,when,i,asked,her,what,she,was,doing,in,atlanta,she,looked,quite,surprised,at,my,ignorance,and,told,me,that,they,were,living,here,now,and,that,you,had,been,kind,enough,to,make,mr,wilkes,a,partner,in,your,mill,<END>
well,what,of,it,<END>
questioned,scarlett,shortly,<END>
when,i,lent,you,the,money,to,buy,that,mill,i,made,one,stipulation,to,which,you,agreed,and,that,was,that,it,should,not,go,to,the,support,of,ashley,wilkes,<END>
you,are,being,very,offensive,<END>
i've,paid,you,back,your,money,and,i,own,the,mill,and,what,i,do,with,it,is,my,own,business,<END>
would,you,mind,telling,me,how,you,made,the,money,to,pay,back,my,loan,<END>
i,made,it,selling,lumber,of,course,<END>
you,made,it,with,the,money,i,lent,you,to,give,you,your,start,<END>
that's,what,you,mean,<END>
my,money,is,being,used,to,support,ashley,<END>
you,are,a,woman,quite,without,honor,and,if,you,hadn't,repaid,my,loan,i'd,take,great,pleasure,in,calling,it,in,now,and,selling,you,out,at,public,auction,if,you,couldn't,pay,<END>
he,spoke,lightly,but,there,was,anger,flickering,in,his,eyes,<END>
scarlett,hastily,carried,the,warfare,into,the,enemy's,territory,<END>
why,do,you,hate,ashley,so,much,<END>
i,believe,you're,jealous,of,him,<END>
after,she,had,spoken,she,could,have,bitten,her,tongue,for,he,threw,back,his,head,and,laughed,until,she,went,red,with,mortification,<END>
add,conceit,to,dishonor,he,said,<END>
you'll,never,get,over,being,the,belle,of,the,county,will,you,<END>
you'll,always,think,you're,the,cutest,little,trick,in,shoe,leather,and,that,every,man,you,meet,is,expiring,for,love,of,you,<END>
i,don't,either,<END>
she,cried,hotly,<END>
but,i,just,can't,see,why,you,hate,ashley,so,much,and,that's,the,only,explanation,i,can,think,of,<END>
well,think,something,else,pretty,charmer,for,that's,the,wrong,explanation,<END>
and,as,for,hating,ashley,i,don't,hate,him,any,more,than,i,like,him,<END>
in,fact,my,only,emotion,toward,him,and,his,kind,is,pity,<END>
pity,<END>
yes,and,a,little,contempt,<END>
now,swell,up,like,a,gobbler,and,tell,me,that,he,is,worth,a,thousand,blackguards,like,me,and,that,i,shouldn't,dare,to,be,so,presumptuous,as,to,feel,either,pity,or,contempt,for,him,<END>
and,when,you,have,finished,swelling,i'll,tell,you,what,i,mean,if,you're,interested,<END>
well,i'm,not,<END>
i,shall,tell,you,just,the,same,for,i,can't,bear,for,you,to,go,on,nursing,your,pleasant,delusion,of,my,jealousy,<END>
i,pity,him,because,he,ought,to,be,dead,and,he,isn't,<END>
and,i,have,a,contempt,for,him,because,he,doesn't,know,what,to,do,with,himself,now,that,his,world,is,gone,<END>
there,was,something,familiar,in,the,idea,he,expressed,<END>
she,had,a,confused,memory,of,having,heard,similar,words,but,she,could,not,remember,when,and,where,<END>
she,did,not,think,very,hard,about,it,for,her,anger,was,hot,<END>
if,you,had,your,way,all,the,decent,men,in,the,south,would,be,dead,<END>
and,if,they,had,their,way,i,think,ashley's,kind,would,prefer,to,be,dead,<END>
dead,with,neat,stones,above,them,saying,'here,lies,a,soldier,of,the,confederacy,dead,for,the,southland',or,'dulce,et,decorum,est,',or,any,of,the,other,popular,epitaphs,<END>
i,don't,see,why,<END>
you,never,see,anything,that,isn't,written,in,letters,a,foot,high,and,then,shoved,under,your,nose,do,you,<END>
if,they,were,dead,their,troubles,would,be,over,there'd,be,no,problems,to,face,problems,that,have,no,solutions,<END>
moreover,their,families,would,be,proud,of,them,through,countless,generations,<END>
and,i've,heard,the,dead,are,happy,<END>
do,you,suppose,ashley,wilkes,is,happy,<END>
why,of,course,she,began,and,then,she,remembered,the,look,in,ashley's,eyes,recently,and,stopped,<END>
is,he,happy,or,hugh,elsing,or,dr,meade,<END>
any,more,than,my,father,and,your,father,were,happy,<END>
well,perhaps,not,as,happy,as,they,might,be,because,they've,all,lost,their,money,<END>
he,laughed,<END>
it,isn't,losing,their,money,my,pet,<END>
i,tell,you,it's,losing,their,world,the,world,they,were,raised,in,<END>
they're,like,fish,out,of,water,or,cats,with,wings,<END>
they,were,raised,to,be,certain,persons,to,do,certain,things,to,occupy,certain,niches,<END>
and,those,persons,and,things,and,niches,disappeared,forever,when,general,lee,arrived,at,appomattox,<END>
oh,scarlett,don't,look,so,stupid,<END>
what,is,there,for,ashley,wilkes,to,do,now,that,his,home,is,gone,and,his,plantation,taken,up,for,taxes,and,fine,gentlemen,are,going,twenty,for,a,penny,<END>
can,he,work,with,his,head,or,his,hands,<END>
i'll,bet,you've,lost,money,hand,over,fist,since,he,took,over,that,mill,<END>
i,have,not,<END>
how,nice,<END>
may,i,look,over,your,books,some,sunday,evening,when,you,are,at,leisure,<END>
you,can,go,to,the,devil,and,not,at,your,leisure,<END>
you,can,go,now,for,all,i,care,<END>
my,pet,i've,been,to,the,devil,and,he's,a,very,dull,fellow,<END>
i,won't,go,there,again,even,for,you,<END>
you,took,my,money,when,you,needed,it,desperately,and,you,used,it,<END>
we,had,an,agreement,as,to,how,it,should,be,used,and,you,have,broken,that,agreement,<END>
just,remember,my,precious,little,cheat,the,time,will,come,when,you,will,want,to,borrow,more,money,from,me,<END>
you'll,want,me,to,bank,you,at,some,incredibly,low,interest,so,you,can,buy,more,mills,and,more,mules,and,build,more,saloons,<END>
and,you,can,whistle,for,the,money,<END>
when,i,need,money,i'll,borrow,it,from,the,bank,thank,you,she,said,coldly,but,her,breast,was,heaving,with,rage,<END>
will,you,<END>
try,to,do,it,<END>
i,own,plenty,of,stock,in,the,bank,<END>
you,do,<END>
yes,i,am,interested,in,some,honest,enterprises,<END>
there,are,other,banks,<END>
plenty,of,them,<END>
and,if,i,can,manage,it,you'll,play,hell,getting,a,cent,from,any,of,them,<END>
you,can,go,to,the,carpetbag,usurers,if,you,want,money,<END>
i'll,go,to,them,with,pleasure,<END>
you'll,go,but,with,little,pleasure,when,you,learn,their,rates,of,interest,<END>
my,pretty,there,are,penalties,in,the,business,world,for,crooked,dealing,<END>
you,should,have,played,straight,with,me,<END>
you're,a,fine,man,aren't,you,<END>
so,rich,and,powerful,yet,picking,on,people,who,are,down,like,ashley,and,me,<END>
don't,put,yourself,in,his,class,<END>
you,aren't,down,<END>
nothing,will,down,you,<END>
but,he,is,down,and,he'll,stay,there,unless,there's,some,energetic,person,behind,him,guiding,and,protecting,him,as,long,as,he,lives,<END>
i'm,of,no,mind,to,have,my,money,used,for,the,benefit,of,such,a,person,<END>
you,didn't,mind,helping,me,and,i,was,down,and,<END>
you,were,a,good,risk,my,dear,an,interesting,risk,<END>
why,<END>
because,you,didn't,plump,yourself,down,on,your,male,relatives,and,sob,for,the,old,days,<END>
you,got,out,and,hustled,and,now,your,fortunes,are,firmly,planted,on,money,stolen,from,a,dead,man's,wallet,and,money,stolen,from,the,confederacy,<END>
you've,got,murder,to,your,credit,and,husband,stealing,attempted,fornication,lying,and,sharp,dealing,and,any,amount,of,chicanery,that,won't,bear,close,inspection,<END>
admirable,things,all,of,them,<END>
they,show,you,to,be,a,person,of,energy,and,determination,and,a,good,money,risk,<END>
it's,entertaining,helping,people,who,help,themselves,<END>
i'd,lend,ten,thousand,dollars,without,even,a,note,to,that,old,roman,matron,mrs,merriwether,<END>
she,started,with,a,basket,of,pies,and,look,at,her,now,<END>
a,bakery,employing,half,a,dozen,people,old,grandpa,happy,with,his,delivery,wagon,and,that,lazy,little,creole,rene,working,hard,and,liking,it,<END>
or,that,poor,devil,tommy,wellburn,who,does,two,men's,work,with,half,a,man's,body,and,does,it,well,or,well,i,won't,go,on,and,bore,you,<END>
you,do,bore,me,<END>
you,bore,me,to,distraction,said,scarlett,coldly,hoping,to,annoy,him,and,divert,him,from,the,ever-,unfortunate,subject,of,ashley,<END>
but,he,only,laughed,shortly,and,refused,to,take,up,the,gauntlet,<END>
people,like,them,are,worth,helping,<END>
but,ashley,wilkes,bah,<END>
his,breed,is,of,no,use,or,value,in,an,upside-down,world,like,ours,<END>
whenever,the,world,up-ends,his,kind,is,the,first,to,perish,<END>
and,why,not,<END>
they,don't,deserve,to,survive,because,they,won't,fight,don't,know,how,to,fight,<END>
this,isn't,the,first,time,the,world's,been,upside,down,and,it,won't,be,the,last,<END>
it's,happened,before,and,it'll,happen,again,<END>
and,when,it,does,happen,everyone,loses,everything,and,everyone,is,equal,<END>
and,then,they,all,start,again,at,taw,with,nothing,at,all,<END>
that,is,nothing,except,the,cunning,of,their,brains,and,strength,of,their,hands,<END>
but,some,people,like,ashley,have,neither,cunning,nor,strength,or,having,them,scruple,to,use,them,<END>
and,so,they,go,under,and,they,should,go,under,<END>
it's,a,natural,law,and,the,world,is,better,off,without,them,<END>
but,there,are,always,a,hardy,few,who,come,through,and,given,time,they,are,right,back,where,they,were,before,the,world,turned,over,<END>
you've,been,poor,<END>
you,just,said,that,your,father,turned,you,out,without,a,penny,<END>
said,scarlett,furious,<END>
i,should,think,you'd,understand,and,sympathize,with,ashley,<END>
i,do,understand,said,rhett,but,i'm,damned,if,i,sympathize,<END>
after,the,surrender,ashley,had,much,more,than,i,had,when,i,was,thrown,out,<END>
at,least,he,had,friends,who,took,him,in,whereas,i,was,ishmael,<END>
but,what,has,ashley,done,with,himself,<END>
if,you,are,comparing,him,with,yourself,you,conceited,thing,why,he's,not,like,you,thank,god,<END>
he,wouldn't,soil,his,hands,as,you,do,making,money,with,carpetbaggers,and,scallawags,and,yankees,<END>
he's,scrupulous,and,honorable,<END>
but,not,too,scrupulous,and,honorable,to,take,aid,and,money,from,a,woman,<END>
what,else,could,he,have,done,<END>
who,am,i,to,say,<END>
i,only,know,what,i,did,both,when,i,was,thrown,out,and,nowadays,<END>
i,only,know,what,other,men,have,done,<END>
we,saw,opportunity,in,the,ruin,of,a,civilization,and,we,made,the,most,of,our,opportunity,some,honestly,some,shadily,and,we,are,still,making,the,most,of,it,<END>
but,the,ashleys,of,this,world,have,the,same,chances,and,don't,take,them,<END>
they,just,aren't,smart,scarlett,and,only,the,smart,deserve,to,survive,<END>
she,hardly,heard,what,he,was,saying,for,now,there,was,coming,back,to,her,the,exact,memory,which,had,teased,her,a,few,minutes,before,when,he,first,began,speaking,<END>
she,remembered,the,cold,wind,that,swept,the,orchard,of,tara,and,ashley,standing,by,a,pile,of,rails,his,eyes,looking,beyond,her,<END>
and,he,had,said,what,<END>
some,funny,foreign,name,that,sounded,like,profanity,and,had,talked,of,the,end,of,the,world,<END>
she,had,not,known,what,he,meant,then,but,now,bewildered,comprehension,was,coming,to,her,and,with,it,a,sick,weary,feeling,<END>
why,ashley,said,<END>
yes,<END>
once,at,tara,he,said,something,about,the,a,dusk,of,the,gods,and,about,the,end,of,the,world,and,some,such,foolishness,<END>
ah,the,gotterdammerung,<END>
rhett's,eyes,were,sharp,with,interest,<END>
and,what,else,<END>
oh,i,don't,remember,exactly,<END>
i,wasn't,paying,much,mind,<END>
but,yes,something,about,the,strong,coming,through,and,the,weak,being,winnowed,out,<END>
ah,so,he,knows,<END>
then,that,makes,it,harder,for,him,<END>
most,of,them,don't,know,and,will,never,know,<END>
they'll,wonder,all,their,lives,where,the,lost,enchantment,has,vanished,<END>
they'll,simply,suffer,in,proud,and,incompetent,silence,<END>
but,he,understands,<END>
he,knows,he's,winnowed,out,<END>
oh,he,isn't,<END>
not,while,i've,got,breath,in,my,body,<END>
he,looked,at,her,quietly,and,his,brown,face,was,smooth,<END>

did,he,struggle,very,hard,against,you,<END>
she,had,a,quick,memory,of,the,scene,with,ashley,after,gerald's,funeral,and,put,it,from,her,<END>
why,of,course,not,she,replied,indignantly,<END>
when,i,explained,to,him,that,i,needed,his,help,because,i,didn't,trust,that,scamp,who,was,running,the,mill,and,frank,was,too,busy,to,help,me,and,i,was,going,to,well,there,was,ella,lorena,you,see,<END>
he,was,very,glad,to,help,me,out,<END>
sweet,are,the,uses,of,motherhood,<END>
so,that's,how,you,got,around,him,<END>
well,you've,got,him,where,you,want,him,now,poor,devil,as,shackled,to,you,by,obligations,as,any,of,your,convicts,are,by,their,chains,<END>
and,i,wish,you,both,joy,<END>
but,as,i,said,at,the,beginning,of,this,discussion,you'll,never,get,another,cent,out,of,me,for,any,of,your,little,unladylike,schemes,my,double-dealing,lady,<END>
she,was,smarting,with,anger,and,with,disappointment,as,well,<END>
for,some,time,she,had,been,planning,to,borrow,more,money,from,rhett,to,buy,a,lot,downtown,and,start,a,lumber,yard,there,<END>
i,can,do,without,your,money,she,cried,<END>
i'm,making,money,out,of,johnnie,gallegher's,mill,plenty,of,it,now,that,i,don't,use,free,darkies,and,i,have,some,money,out,on,mortgages,and,we,are,coining,cash,at,the,store,from,the,darky,trade,<END>
yes,so,i,heard,<END>
how,clever,of,you,to,rook,the,helpless,and,the,widow,and,the,orphan,and,the,ignorant,<END>
but,if,you,must,steal,scarlett,why,not,steal,from,the,rich,and,strong,instead,of,the,poor,and,weak,<END>
from,robin,hood,on,down,to,now,that's,been,considered,highly,moral,<END>
because,said,scarlett,shortly,it's,a,sight,easier,and,safer,to,steal,as,you,call,it,from,the,poor,<END>
he,laughed,silently,his,shoulders,shaking,<END>
you're,a,fine,honest,rogue,scarlett,<END>
a,rogue,<END>
queer,that,that,term,should,hurt,<END>
she,wasn't,a,rogue,she,told,herself,vehemently,<END>
at,least,that,wasn't,what,she,wanted,to,be,<END>
she,wanted,to,be,a,great,lady,<END>
for,a,moment,her,mind,went,swiftly,down,the,years,and,she,saw,her,mother,moving,with,a,sweet,swish,of,skirts,and,a,faint,fragrance,of,sachet,her,small,busy,hands,tireless,in,the,service,of,others,loved,respected,cherished,<END>
and,suddenly,her,heart,was,sick,<END>
if,you,are,trying,to,devil,me,she,said,tiredly,it's,no,use,<END>
i,know,i'm,not,as,scrupulous,as,i,should,be,these,days,<END>
not,as,kind,and,as,pleasant,as,i,was,brought,up,to,be,<END>
but,i,can't,help,it,rhett,<END>
truly,i,can't,<END>
what,else,could,i,have,done,<END>
what,would,have,happened,to,me,to,wade,to,tara,and,all,of,us,if,i'd,been,gentle,when,that,yankee,came,to,tara,<END>
i,should,have,been,but,i,don't,even,want,to,think,of,that,<END>
and,when,jonas,wilkerson,was,going,to,take,the,home,place,suppose,i'd,been,kind,and,scrupulous,<END>
where,would,we,all,be,now,<END>
and,if,i'd,been,sweet,and,simple,minded,and,not,nagged,frank,about,bad,debts,we'd,oh,well,<END>
maybe,i,am,a,rogue,but,i,won't,be,a,rogue,forever,rhett,<END>
but,during,these,past,years,and,even,now,what,else,could,i,have,done,<END>
how,else,could,i,have,acted,<END>
i've,felt,that,i,was,trying,to,row,a,heavily,loaded,boat,in,a,storm,<END>
i've,had,so,much,trouble,just,trying,to,keep,afloat,that,i,couldn't,be,bothered,about,things,that,didn't,matter,things,i,could,part,with,easily,and,not,miss,like,good,manners,and,well,things,like,that,<END>
i've,been,too,afraid,my,boat,would,be,swamped,and,so,i've,dumped,overboard,the,things,that,seemed,least,important,<END>
pride,and,honor,and,truth,and,virtue,and,kindliness,he,enumerated,silkily,<END>
you,are,right,scarlett,<END>
they,aren't,important,when,a,boat,is,sinking,<END>
but,look,around,you,at,your,friends,<END>
either,they,are,bringing,their,boats,ashore,safely,with,cargoes,intact,or,they,are,content,to,go,down,with,all,flags,flying,<END>
they,are,a,passel,of,fools,she,said,shortly,<END>
there's,a,time,for,all,things,<END>
when,i've,got,plenty,of,money,i'll,be,nice,as,you,please,too,<END>
butter,won't,melt,in,my,mouth,<END>
i,can,afford,to,be,then,<END>
you,can,afford,to,be,but,you,won't,<END>
it's,hard,to,salvage,jettisoned,cargo,and,if,it,is,retrieved,it's,usually,irreparably,damaged,<END>
and,i,fear,that,when,you,can,afford,to,fish,up,the,honor,and,virtue,and,kindness,you've,thrown,overboard,you'll,find,they,have,suffered,a,sea,change,and,not,i,fear,into,something,rich,and,strange,<END>
he,rose,suddenly,and,picked,up,his,hat,<END>
you,are,going,<END>
yes,<END>
aren't,you,relieved,<END>
i,leave,you,to,what,remains,of,your,conscience,<END>
he,paused,and,looked,down,at,the,baby,putting,out,a,finger,for,the,child,to,grip,<END>
i,suppose,frank,is,bursting,with,pride,<END>
oh,of,course,<END>
has,a,lot,of,plans,for,this,baby,i,suppose,<END>
oh,well,you,know,how,silly,men,are,about,their,babies,<END>
then,tell,him,said,rhett,and,stopped,short,an,odd,look,on,his,face,tell,him,if,he,wants,to,see,his,plans,for,his,child,work,out,he'd,better,stay,home,at,night,more,often,than,he's,doing,<END>
what,do,you,mean,<END>

oh,you,vile,creature,<END>
to,insinuate,that,poor,frank,would,<END>

the,march,afternoon,was,windy,and,cold,and,scarlett,pulled,the,lap,robe,high,under,her,arms,as,she,drove,out,the,decatur,road,toward,johnnie,gallegher's,mill,<END>
driving,alone,was,hazardous,these,days,and,she,knew,it,more,hazardous,than,ever,before,for,now,the,negroes,were,completely,out,of,hand,<END>
as,ashley,had,prophesied,there,had,been,hell,to,pay,since,the,legislature,refused,to,ratify,the,amendment,<END>
the,stout,refusal,had,been,like,a,slap,in,the,face,of,the,furious,north,and,retaliation,had,come,swiftly,<END>
the,north,was,determined,to,force,the,negro,vote,on,the,state,and,to,this,end,georgia,had,been,declared,in,rebellion,and,put,under,the,strictest,martial,law,<END>
georgia's,very,existence,as,a,state,had,been,wiped,out,and,it,had,become,with,florida,and,alabama,military,district,number,three,under,the,command,of,a,federal,general,<END>
if,life,had,been,insecure,and,frightening,before,this,it,was,doubly,so,now,<END>
the,military,regulations,which,had,seemed,so,stringent,the,year,before,were,now,mild,by,comparison,with,the,ones,issued,by,general,pope,<END>
confronted,with,the,prospect,of,negro,rule,the,future,seemed,dark,and,hopeless,and,the,embittered,state,smarted,and,writhed,helplessly,<END>
as,for,the,negroes,their,new,importance,went,to,their,heads,and,realizing,that,they,had,the,yankee,army,behind,them,their,outrages,increased,<END>
no,one,was,safe,from,them,<END>
in,this,wild,and,fearful,time,scarlett,was,frightened,frightened,but,determined,and,she,still,made,her,rounds,alone,with,frank's,pistol,tucked,in,the,upholstery,of,the,buggy,<END>
she,silently,cursed,the,legislature,for,bringing,this,worse,disaster,upon,them,all,<END>
what,good,had,it,done,this,fine,brave,stand,this,gesture,which,everyone,called,gallant,<END>
it,had,just,made,matters,so,much,worse,<END>
as,she,drew,near,the,path,that,led,down,through,the,bare,trees,into,the,creek,bottom,where,the,shantytown,settlement,was,she,clucked,to,the,horse,to,quicken,his,speed,<END>
she,always,felt,uneasy,driving,past,this,dirty,sordid,cluster,of,discarded,army,tents,and,slave,cabins,<END>
it,had,the,worst,reputation,of,any,spot,in,or,near,atlanta,for,here,lived,in,filth,outcast,negroes,black,prostitutes,and,a,scattering,of,poor,whites,of,the,lowest,order,<END>
it,was,rumored,to,be,the,refuge,of,negro,and,white,criminals,and,was,the,first,place,the,yankee,soldiers,searched,when,they,wanted,a,man,<END>
shootings,and,cuttings,went,on,here,with,such,regularity,that,the,authorities,seldom,troubled,to,investigate,and,generally,left,the,shantytowners,to,settle,their,own,dark,affairs,<END>
back,in,the,woods,there,was,a,still,that,manufactured,a,cheap,quality,of,corn,whisky,and,by,night,the,cabins,in,the,creek,bottoms,resounded,with,drunken,yells,and,curses,<END>
even,the,yankees,admitted,that,it,was,a,plague,spot,and,should,be,wiped,out,but,they,took,no,steps,in,this,direction,<END>
indignation,was,loud,among,the,inhabitants,of,atlanta,and,decatur,who,were,forced,to,use,the,road,for,travel,between,the,two,towns,<END>
men,went,by,shantytown,with,their,pistols,loosened,in,their,holsters,and,nice,women,never,willingly,passed,it,even,under,the,protection,of,their,men,for,usually,there,were,drunken,negro,slatterns,sitting,along,the,road,hurling,insults,and,shouting,coarse,words,<END>
as,long,as,she,had,archie,beside,her,scarlett,had,not,given,shantytown,a,thought,because,not,even,the,most,impudent,negro,woman,dared,laugh,in,her,presence,<END>
but,since,she,had,been,forced,to,drive,alone,there,had,been,any,number,of,annoying,maddening,incidents,<END>
the,negro,sluts,seemed,to,try,themselves,whenever,she,drove,by,<END>
there,was,nothing,she,could,do,except,ignore,them,and,boil,with,rage,<END>
she,could,not,even,take,comfort,in,airing,her,troubles,to,her,neighbors,or,family,because,the,neighbors,would,say,triumphantly,well,what,else,did,you,expect,<END>
and,her,family,would,take,on,dreadfully,again,and,try,to,stop,her,<END>
and,she,had,no,intention,of,stopping,her,trips,<END>
thank,heaven,there,were,no,ragged,women,along,the,roadside,today,<END>
as,she,passed,the,trail,leading,down,to,the,settlement,she,looked,with,distaste,at,the,group,of,shacks,squatting,in,the,hollow,in,the,dreary,slant,of,the,afternoon,sun,<END>
there,was,a,chill,wind,blowing,and,as,she,passed,there,came,to,her,nose,the,mingled,smells,of,wood,smoke,frying,pork,and,untended,privies,<END>
averting,her,nose,she,flapped,the,reins,smartly,across,the,horse's,back,and,hurried,him,past,and,around,the,bend,of,the,road,<END>
just,as,she,was,beginning,to,draw,a,breath,of,relief,her,heart,rose,in,her,throat,with,sudden,fright,for,a,huge,negro,slipped,silently,from,behind,a,large,oak,tree,<END>
she,was,frightened,but,not,enough,to,lose,her,wits,and,in,an,instant,the,horse,was,pulled,up,and,she,had,frank's,pistol,in,her,hand,<END>
what,do,you,want,<END>

when,she,reached,the,mill,the,sun,was,setting,and,it,was,later,than,she,cared,to,be,out,<END>
johnnie,gallegher,was,standing,in,the,doorway,of,the,miserable,shack,that,served,as,cook,room,for,the,little,lumber,camp,<END>
sitting,on,a,log,in,front,of,the,slab-sided,shack,that,was,their,sleeping,quarters,were,four,of,the,five,convicts,scarlett,had,apportioned,to,johnnie's,mill,<END>
their,convict,uniforms,were,dirty,and,foul,with,sweat,shackles,clanked,between,their,ankles,when,they,moved,tiredly,and,there,was,an,air,of,apathy,and,despair,about,them,<END>
they,were,a,thin,unwholesome,lot,scarlett,thought,peering,sharply,at,them,and,when,she,had,leased,them,so,short,a,time,before,they,were,an,upstanding,crew,<END>
they,did,not,even,raise,their,eyes,as,she,dismounted,from,the,buggy,but,johnnie,turned,toward,her,carelessly,dragging,off,his,hat,<END>
his,little,brown,face,was,as,hard,as,a,nut,as,he,greeted,her,<END>
i,don't,like,the,look,of,the,men,she,said,abruptly,<END>
they,don't,look,well,<END>

he's,in,the,bunk,house,<END>

don't,do,that,<END>
he's,probably,nekkid,<END>
i'll,tend,to,him,<END>
he'll,be,back,at,work,tomorrow,<END>
scarlett,hesitated,and,saw,one,of,the,convicts,raise,a,weary,head,and,give,johnnie,a,stare,of,intense,hatred,before,he,looked,at,the,ground,again,<END>
have,you,been,whipping,these,men,<END>
now,mrs,kennedy,begging,your,pardon,who's,running,this,mill,<END>
you,put,me,in,charge,and,told,me,to,run,it,<END>
you,said,i'd,have,a,free,hand,<END>
you,ain't,got,no,complaints,to,make,of,me,have,you,<END>
ain't,i,making,twice,as,much,for,you,as,mr,elsing,did,<END>
yes,you,are,said,scarlett,but,a,shiver,went,over,her,like,a,goose,walking,across,her,grave,<END>
there,was,something,sinister,about,this,camp,with,its,ugly,shacks,something,which,had,not,been,here,when,hugh,elsing,had,it,<END>
there,was,a,loneliness,an,isolation,about,it,that,chilled,her,<END>
these,convicts,were,so,far,away,from,everything,so,completely,at,the,mercy,of,johnnie,gallegher,and,if,he,chose,to,whip,them,or,otherwise,mistreat,them,she,would,probably,never,know,about,it,<END>
the,convicts,would,be,afraid,to,complain,to,her,for,fear,of,worse,punishment,after,she,was,gone,<END>
the,men,look,thin,<END>
are,you,giving,them,enough,to,eat,<END>
god,knows,i,spend,enough,money,on,their,food,to,make,them,fat,as,hogs,<END>
the,flour,and,pork,alone,cost,thirty,dollars,last,month,<END>
what,are,you,giving,them,for,supper,<END>
she,stepped,over,to,the,cook,shack,and,looked,in,<END>
a,fat,mulatto,woman,who,was,leaning,over,a,rusty,old,stove,dropped,a,half,curtsy,as,she,saw,scarlett,and,went,on,stirring,a,pot,in,which,black-eyed,peas,were,cooking,<END>
scarlett,knew,johnnie,gallegher,lived,with,her,but,thought,it,best,to,ignore,the,fact,<END>
she,saw,that,except,for,the,peas,and,a,pan,of,corn,pone,there,was,no,other,food,being,prepared,<END>
haven't,you,got,anything,else,for,these,men,<END>
no'm,<END>
haven't,you,got,any,side,meat,in,these,peas,<END>
no'm,<END>
no,boiling,bacon,in,the,peas,<END>
but,black-eyed,peas,are,no,good,without,bacon,<END>
there's,no,strength,to,them,<END>
why,isn't,there,any,bacon,<END>
mist',johnnie,he,say,dar,ain',no,use,puttin',in,no,side,meat,<END>
you'll,put,bacon,in,<END>
where,do,you,keep,your,supplies,<END>
the,negro,woman,rolled,frightened,eyes,toward,the,small,closet,that,served,as,a,pantry,and,scarlett,threw,the,door,open,<END>
there,was,an,open,barrel,of,cornmeal,on,the,floor,a,small,sack,of,flour,a,pound,of,coffee,a,little,sugar,a,gallon,jug,of,sorghum,and,two,hams,<END>
one,of,the,hams,sitting,on,the,shelf,had,been,recently,cooked,and,only,one,or,two,slices,had,been,cut,from,it,<END>
scarlett,turned,in,a,fury,on,johnnie,gallegher,and,met,his,coldly,angry,gaze,<END>
where,are,the,five,sacks,of,white,flour,i,sent,out,last,week,<END>
and,the,sugar,sack,and,the,coffee,<END>
and,i,had,five,hams,sent,and,ten,pounds,of,side,meat,and,god,knows,how,many,bushels,of,yams,and,irish,potatoes,<END>
well,where,are,they,<END>
you,can't,have,used,them,all,in,a,week,if,you,fed,the,men,five,meals,a,day,<END>
you've,sold,them,<END>
that's,what,you've,done,you,thief,<END>
sold,my,good,supplies,and,put,the,money,in,your,pocket,and,fed,these,men,on,dried,peas,and,corn,pone,<END>
no,wonder,they,look,so,thin,<END>
get,out,of,the,way,<END>
she,stormed,past,him,to,the,doorway,<END>
you,man,there,on,the,end,yes,you,<END>
come,here,<END>
the,man,rose,and,walked,awkwardly,toward,her,his,shackles,clanking,and,she,saw,that,his,bare,ankles,were,red,and,raw,from,the,chafing,of,the,iron,<END>
when,did,you,last,have,ham,<END>
the,man,looked,down,at,the,ground,<END>
speak,up,<END>
still,the,man,stood,silent,and,abject,<END>
finally,he,raised,his,eyes,looked,scarlett,in,the,face,imploringly,and,dropped,his,gaze,again,<END>
scared,to,talk,eh,<END>
well,go,in,the,pantry,and,get,that,ham,off,the,shelf,<END>
rebecca,give,him,your,knife,<END>
take,it,out,to,those,men,and,divide,it,up,<END>
rebecca,make,some,biscuits,and,coffee,for,the,men,<END>
and,serve,plenty,of,sorghum,<END>

you,do,what,i,say,<END>
get,busy,<END>
johnnie,gallegher,come,out,to,the,buggy,with,me,<END>
she,stalked,across,the,littered,yard,and,climbed,into,the,buggy,noticing,with,grim,satisfaction,that,the,men,were,tearing,at,the,ham,and,cramming,bits,into,their,mouths,voraciously,<END>
they,looked,as,if,they,feared,it,would,be,taken,from,them,at,any,minute,<END>
you,are,a,rare,scoundrel,<END>
she,cried,furiously,to,johnnie,as,he,stood,at,the,wheel,his,hat,pushed,back,from,his,lowering,brow,<END>
and,you,can,just,hand,over,to,me,the,price,of,my,supplies,<END>
in,the,future,i'll,bring,you,provisions,every,day,instead,of,ordering,them,by,the,month,<END>
then,you,can't,cheat,me,<END>
in,the,future,i,won't,be,here,said,johnnie,gallegher,<END>
you,mean,you,are,quitting,<END>
for,a,moment,it,was,on,scarlett's,hot,tongue,to,cry,go,and,good,riddance,<END>
but,the,cool,hand,of,caution,stopped,her,<END>
if,johnnie,should,quit,what,would,she,do,<END>
he,had,been,doubling,the,amount,of,lumber,hugh,turned,out,<END>
and,just,now,she,had,a,big,order,the,biggest,she,had,ever,had,and,a,rush,order,at,that,<END>
she,had,to,get,that,lumber,into,atlanta,<END>
if,johnnie,quit,whom,would,she,get,to,take,over,the,mill,<END>
yes,i'm,quitting,<END>
you,put,me,in,complete,charge,here,and,you,told,me,that,all,you,expected,of,me,was,as,much,lumber,as,i,could,possibly,get,out,<END>
you,didn't,tell,me,how,to,run,my,business,then,and,i'm,not,aiming,to,have,you,start,now,<END>
how,i,get,the,lumber,out,is,no,affair,of,yours,<END>
you,can't,complain,that,i've,fallen,down,on,my,bargain,<END>
i've,made,money,for,you,and,i've,earned,my,salary,and,what,i,could,pick,up,on,the,side,too,<END>
and,here,you,come,out,here,interfering,asking,questions,and,breaking,my,authority,in,front,of,the,men,<END>
how,can,you,expect,me,to,keep,discipline,after,this,<END>
what,if,the,men,do,get,an,occasional,lick,<END>
the,lazy,scum,deserve,worse,<END>
what,if,they,ain't,fed,up,and,pampered,<END>
they,don't,deserve,nothing,better,<END>
either,you,tend,to,your,business,and,let,me,tend,to,mine,or,i,quit,tonight,<END>
his,hard,little,face,looked,flintier,than,ever,and,scarlett,was,in,a,quandary,<END>
if,he,quit,tonight,what,would,she,do,<END>
she,couldn't,stay,here,all,night,guarding,the,convicts,<END>
something,of,her,dilemma,showed,in,her,eyes,for,johnnie's,expression,changed,subtly,and,some,of,the,hardness,went,out,of,his,face,<END>
there,was,an,easy,agreeable,note,in,his,voice,when,he,spoke,<END>
it's,getting,late,mrs,kennedy,and,you'd,better,be,getting,on,home,<END>
we,ain't,going,to,fall,out,over,a,little,thing,like,this,are,we,<END>
s'pose,you,take,ten,dollars,out,of,my,next,month's,wages,and,let's,call,it,square,<END>
scarlett's,eyes,went,unwillingly,to,the,miserable,group,gnawing,on,the,ham,and,she,thought,of,the,sick,man,lying,in,the,windy,shack,<END>
she,ought,to,get,rid,of,johnnie,gallegher,<END>
he,was,a,thief,and,a,brutal,man,<END>
there,was,no,telling,what,he,did,to,the,convicts,when,she,wasn't,there,<END>
but,on,the,other,hand,he,was,smart,and,god,knows,she,needed,a,smart,man,<END>
well,she,couldn't,part,with,him,now,<END>
he,was,making,money,for,her,<END>
she'd,just,have,to,see,to,it,that,the,convicts,got,their,proper,rations,in,the,future,<END>
i'll,take,twenty,dollars,out,of,your,wages,she,said,shortly,and,i'll,be,back,and,discuss,the,matter,further,in,the,morning,<END>
she,picked,up,the,reins,<END>
but,she,knew,there,would,be,no,further,discussion,<END>
she,knew,that,the,matter,had,ended,there,and,she,knew,johnnie,knew,it,<END>
as,she,drove,off,down,the,path,to,the,decatur,road,her,conscience,battled,with,her,desire,for,money,<END>
she,knew,she,had,no,business,exposing,human,lives,to,the,hard,little,man's,mercies,<END>
if,he,should,cause,the,death,of,one,of,them,she,would,be,as,guilty,as,he,was,for,she,had,kept,him,in,charge,after,learning,of,his,brutalities,<END>
but,on,the,other,hand,well,on,the,other,hand,men,had,no,business,getting,to,be,convicts,<END>
if,they,broke,laws,and,got,caught,then,they,deserved,what,they,got,<END>
this,partly,salved,her,conscience,but,as,she,drove,down,the,road,the,dull,thin,faces,of,the,convicts,would,keep,coming,back,into,her,mind,<END>
oh,i'll,think,of,them,later,she,decided,and,pushed,the,thought,into,the,lumber,room,of,her,mind,and,shut,the,door,upon,it,<END>
the,sun,had,completely,gone,when,she,reached,the,bend,in,the,road,above,shantytown,and,the,woods,about,her,were,dark,<END>
with,the,disappearance,of,the,sun,a,bitter,chill,had,fallen,on,the,twilight,world,and,a,cold,wind,blew,through,the,dark,woods,making,the,bare,boughs,crack,and,the,dead,leaves,rustle,<END>
she,had,never,been,out,this,late,by,herself,and,she,was,uneasy,and,wished,herself,home,<END>
big,sam,was,nowhere,to,be,seen,and,as,she,drew,rein,to,wait,for,him,she,worried,about,his,absence,fearing,the,yankees,might,have,already,picked,him,up,<END>
then,she,heard,footsteps,coming,up,the,path,from,the,settlement,and,a,sigh,of,relief,went,through,her,lips,<END>
she'd,certainly,dress,sam,down,for,keeping,her,waiting,<END>
but,it,wasn't,sam,who,came,round,the,bend,<END>
it,was,a,big,ragged,white,man,and,a,squat,black,negro,with,shoulders,and,chest,like,a,gorilla,<END>
swiftly,she,flapped,the,reins,on,the,horse's,back,and,clutched,the,pistol,<END>
the,horse,started,to,trot,and,suddenly,shied,as,the,white,man,threw,up,his,hand,<END>
lady,he,said,can,you,give,me,a,quarter,<END>
i'm,sure,hungry,<END>
get,out,of,the,way,she,answered,keeping,her,voice,as,steady,as,she,could,<END>
i,haven't,got,any,money,<END>
giddap,<END>
with,a,sudden,swift,movement,the,man's,hand,was,on,the,horse's,bridle,<END>
grab,her,<END>
he,shouted,to,the,negro,<END>
she's,probably,got,her,money,in,her,bosom,<END>
what,happened,next,was,like,a,nightmare,to,scarlett,and,it,all,happened,so,quickly,<END>
she,brought,up,her,pistol,swiftly,and,some,instinct,told,her,not,to,fire,at,the,white,man,for,fear,of,shooting,the,horse,<END>
as,the,negro,came,running,to,the,buggy,his,black,face,twisted,in,a,leering,grin,she,fired,point-blank,at,him,<END>
whether,or,not,she,hit,him,she,never,knew,but,the,next,minute,the,pistol,was,wrenched,from,her,hand,by,a,grasp,that,almost,broke,her,wrist,<END>
the,negro,was,beside,her,so,close,that,she,could,smell,the,rank,odor,of,him,as,he,tried,to,drag,her,over,the,buggy,side,<END>
with,her,one,free,hand,she,fought,madly,clawing,at,his,face,and,then,she,felt,his,big,hand,at,her,throat,and,with,a,ripping,noise,her,basque,was,torn,open,from,neck,to,waist,<END>
then,the,black,hand,fumbled,between,her,breasts,and,terror,and,revulsion,such,as,she,had,never,known,came,over,her,and,she,screamed,like,an,insane,woman,<END>
shut,her,up,<END>
drag,her,out,<END>
cried,the,white,man,and,the,black,hand,fumbled,across,scarlett's,face,to,her,mouth,<END>
she,bit,as,savagely,as,she,could,and,then,screamed,again,and,through,her,screaming,she,heard,the,white,man,swear,and,realized,that,there,was,a,third,man,in,the,dark,road,<END>
the,black,hand,dropped,from,her,mouth,and,the,negro,leaped,away,as,big,sam,charged,at,him,<END>
run,miss,scarlett,<END>
yelled,sam,grappling,with,the,negro,and,scarlett,shaking,and,screaming,clutched,up,the,reins,and,whip,and,laid,them,both,over,the,horse,<END>
it,went,off,at,a,jump,and,she,felt,the,wheels,pass,over,something,soft,something,resistant,<END>
it,was,the,white,man,who,lay,in,the,road,where,sam,had,knocked,him,down,<END>
maddened,by,terror,she,lashed,the,horse,again,and,again,and,it,struck,a,gait,that,made,the,buggy,rock,and,sway,<END>
through,her,terror,she,was,conscious,of,the,sound,of,feet,running,behind,her,and,she,screamed,at,the,horse,to,go,faster,<END>
if,that,black,ape,got,her,again,she,would,die,before,he,even,got,his,hands,upon,her,<END>
a,voice,yelled,behind,her,miss,scarlett,<END>

without,slacking,she,looked,trembling,over,her,shoulder,and,saw,big,sam,racing,down,the,road,behind,her,his,long,legs,working,like,hard-driven,pistons,<END>
she,drew,rein,as,he,came,up,and,he,flung,himself,into,the,buggy,his,big,body,crowding,her,to,one,side,<END>

with,a,shaking,hand,she,clutched,the,two,edges,together,and,bowing,her,head,began,to,cry,in,terrified,sobs,<END>

that,night,when,frank,deposited,her,and,aunt,pitty,and,the,children,at,melanie's,and,rode,off,down,the,street,with,ashley,scarlett,could,have,burst,with,rage,and,hurt,<END>

she,wanted,comforting,indignation,threats,of,vengeance,<END>
she,would,even,have,preferred,him,storming,at,her,saying,that,this,was,just,what,he,had,warned,her,would,happen,anything,rather,than,have,him,take,it,all,so,casually,and,treat,her,danger,as,a,matter,of,small,moment,<END>
he,was,nice,and,gentle,of,course,but,in,an,absent,way,as,if,he,had,something,far,more,important,on,his,mind,<END>
and,that,important,thing,had,turned,out,to,be,a,small,political,meeting,<END>

he,must,know,how,harrowing,her,experience,had,been,must,know,she,did,not,want,to,spend,an,evening,at,melanie's,when,her,tired,body,and,jangled,nerves,cried,out,for,the,warm,relaxation,of,bed,and,blankets,with,a,hot,brick,to,make,her,toes,tingle,and,a,hot,toddy,to,soothe,her,fears,<END>
if,he,really,loved,her,nothing,could,have,forced,him,from,her,side,on,this,of,all,nights,<END>

melanie's,small,parlor,looked,as,serene,as,it,usually,did,on,nights,when,frank,and,ashley,were,away,and,the,women,gathered,together,to,sew,<END>
the,room,was,warm,and,cheerful,in,the,firelight,<END>
the,lamp,on,the,table,shed,a,quiet,yellow,glow,on,the,four,smooth,heads,bent,to,their,needlework,<END>
four,skirts,billowed,modestly,eight,small,feet,were,daintily,placed,on,low,hassocks,<END>
the,quiet,breathing,of,wade,ella,and,beau,came,through,the,open,door,of,the,nursery,<END>
archie,sat,on,a,stool,by,the,hearth,his,back,against,the,fireplace,his,cheek,distended,with,tobacco,whittling,industriously,on,a,bit,of,wood,<END>
the,contrast,between,the,dirty,hairy,old,man,and,the,four,neat,fastidious,ladies,was,as,great,as,though,he,were,a,grizzled,vicious,old,watchdog,and,they,four,small,kittens,<END>
melanie's,soft,voice,tinged,with,indignation,went,on,and,on,as,she,told,of,the,recent,outburst,of,temperament,on,the,part,of,the,lady,harpists,<END>
unable,to,agree,with,the,gentlemen's,glee,club,as,to,the,program,for,their,next,recital,the,ladies,had,waited,on,melanie,that,afternoon,and,announced,their,intention,of,withdrawing,completely,from,the,musical,circle,<END>
it,had,taken,all,of,melanie's,diplomacy,to,persuade,them,to,defer,their,decision,<END>
scarlett,overwrought,could,have,screamed,oh,damn,the,lady,harpists,<END>
she,wanted,to,talk,about,her,dreadful,experience,<END>
she,was,bursting,to,relate,it,in,detail,so,she,could,ease,her,own,fright,by,frightening,the,others,<END>
she,wanted,to,tell,how,brave,she,had,been,just,to,assure,herself,by,the,sound,of,her,own,words,that,she,had,indeed,been,brave,<END>
but,every,time,she,brought,up,the,subject,melanie,deftly,steered,the,conversation,into,other,and,innocuous,channels,<END>
this,irritated,scarlett,almost,beyond,endurance,<END>
they,were,as,mean,as,frank,<END>
how,could,they,be,so,calm,and,placid,when,she,had,just,escaped,so,terrible,a,fate,<END>
they,weren't,even,displaying,common,courtesy,in,denying,her,the,relief,of,talking,about,it,<END>
the,events,of,the,afternoon,had,shaken,her,more,than,she,cared,to,admit,even,to,herself,<END>
every,time,she,thought,of,that,malignant,black,face,peering,at,her,from,the,shadows,of,the,twilight,forest,road,she,fell,to,trembling,<END>
when,she,thought,of,the,black,hand,at,her,bosom,and,what,would,have,happened,if,big,sam,had,not,appeared,she,bent,her,head,lower,and,squeezed,her,eyes,tightly,shut,<END>
the,longer,she,sat,silent,in,the,peaceful,room,trying,to,sew,listening,to,melanie's,voice,the,tighter,her,nerves,stretched,<END>
she,felt,that,at,any,moment,she,would,actually,hear,them,break,with,the,same,pinging,sound,a,banjo,string,makes,when,it,snaps,<END>
archie's,whittling,annoyed,her,and,she,frowned,at,him,<END>
suddenly,it,seemed,odd,that,he,should,be,sitting,there,occupying,himself,with,a,piece,of,wood,<END>
usually,he,lay,flat,on,the,sofa,during,the,evenings,when,he,was,on,guard,and,slept,and,snored,so,violently,that,his,long,beard,leaped,into,the,air,with,each,rumbling,breath,<END>
it,was,odder,still,that,neither,melanie,nor,india,hinted,to,him,that,he,should,spread,a,paper,on,the,floor,to,catch,his,litter,of,shavings,<END>
he,had,already,made,a,perfect,mess,on,the,hearth,rug,but,they,did,not,seem,to,have,noticed,it,<END>
while,she,watched,him,archie,turned,suddenly,toward,the,fire,and,spat,a,stream,of,tobacco,juice,on,it,with,such,vehemence,that,india,melanie,and,pitty,leaped,as,though,a,bomb,had,exploded,<END>
need,you,expectorate,so,loudly,<END>
cried,india,in,a,voice,that,cracked,with,nervous,annoyance,<END>
scarlett,looked,at,her,in,surprise,for,india,was,always,so,self-contained,<END>
archie,gave,her,look,for,look,<END>
i,reckon,i,do,he,answered,coldly,and,spat,again,<END>
melanie,gave,a,little,frowning,glance,at,india,<END>
i,was,always,so,glad,dear,papa,didn't,chew,began,pitty,and,melanie,her,frown,creasing,deeper,swung,on,her,and,spoke,sharper,words,than,scarlett,had,ever,heard,her,speak,<END>
oh,do,hush,auntie,<END>
you're,so,tactless,<END>
oh,dear,<END>
pitty,dropped,her,sewing,in,her,lap,and,her,mouth,pressed,up,in,hurt,<END>
i,declare,i,don't,know,what,ails,you,all,tonight,<END>
you,and,india,are,just,as,jumpy,and,cross,as,two,old,sticks,<END>
no,one,answered,her,<END>
melanie,did,not,even,apologize,for,her,crossness,but,went,back,to,her,sewing,with,small,violence,<END>
you're,taking,stitches,an,inch,long,declared,pitty,with,some,satisfaction,<END>
you'll,have,to,take,every,one,of,them,out,<END>
what's,the,matter,with,you,<END>
but,melanie,still,did,not,answer,<END>
was,there,anything,the,matter,with,them,scarlett,wondered,<END>
had,she,been,too,absorbed,with,her,own,fears,to,notice,<END>
yes,despite,melanie's,attempts,to,make,the,evening,appear,like,any,one,of,fifty,they,had,all,spent,together,there,was,a,difference,due,to,their,alarm,and,shock,at,what,had,happened,that,afternoon,<END>
scarlett,stole,glances,at,her,companions,and,intercepted,a,look,from,india,<END>
it,discomforted,her,because,it,was,a,long,measuring,glance,that,carried,in,its,cold,depths,something,stronger,than,hate,something,more,insulting,than,contempt,<END>
as,though,she,thought,i,was,to,blame,for,what,happened,scarlett,thought,indignantly,<END>
india,turned,from,her,to,archie,and,all,annoyance,at,him,gone,from,her,face,gave,him,a,look,of,veiled,anxious,inquiry,<END>
but,he,did,not,meet,her,eyes,<END>
he,did,however,look,at,scarlett,staring,at,her,in,the,same,cold,hard,way,india,had,done,<END>
silence,fell,dully,in,the,room,as,melanie,did,not,take,up,the,conversation,again,and,in,the,silence,scarlett,heard,the,rising,wind,outside,<END>
it,suddenly,began,to,be,a,most,unpleasant,evening,<END>
now,she,began,to,feel,the,tension,in,the,air,and,she,wondered,if,it,had,been,present,all,during,the,evening,and,she,too,upset,to,notice,it,<END>
about,archie's,face,there,was,an,alert,waiting,look,and,his,tufted,hairy,old,ears,seemed,pricked,up,like,a,lynx's,<END>
there,was,a,severely,repressed,uneasiness,about,melanie,and,india,that,made,them,raise,their,heads,from,their,sewing,at,each,sound,of,hooves,in,the,road,at,each,groan,of,bare,branches,under,the,wailing,wind,at,each,scuffing,sound,of,dry,leaves,tumbling,across,the,lawn,<END>
they,started,at,each,soft,snap,of,burning,logs,on,the,hearth,as,if,they,were,stealthy,footsteps,<END>
something,was,wrong,and,scarlett,wondered,what,it,was,<END>
something,was,afoot,and,she,did,not,know,about,it,<END>
a,glance,at,aunt,pitty's,plump,guileless,face,screwed,up,in,a,pout,told,her,that,the,old,lady,was,as,ignorant,as,she,<END>
but,archie,and,melanie,and,india,knew,<END>
in,the,silence,she,could,almost,feel,the,thoughts,of,india,and,melanie,whirling,as,madly,as,squirrels,in,a,cage,<END>
they,knew,something,were,waiting,for,something,despite,their,efforts,to,make,things,appear,as,usual,<END>
and,their,inner,unease,communicated,itself,to,scarlett,making,her,more,nervous,than,before,<END>
handling,her,needle,awkwardly,she,jabbed,it,into,her,thumb,and,with,a,little,scream,of,pain,and,annoyance,that,made,them,all,jump,she,squeezed,it,until,a,bright,red,drop,appeared,<END>
i'm,just,too,nervous,to,sew,she,declared,throwing,her,mending,to,the,floor,<END>
i'm,nervous,enough,to,scream,<END>
i,want,to,go,home,and,go,to,bed,<END>
and,frank,knew,it,and,he,oughtn't,to,have,gone,out,<END>
he,talks,talks,talks,about,protecting,women,against,darkies,and,carpetbaggers,and,when,the,time,comes,for,him,to,do,some,protecting,where,is,he,<END>
at,home,taking,care,of,me,<END>
no,indeed,he's,gallivanting,around,with,a,lot,of,other,men,who,don't,do,anything,but,talk,and,<END>
her,snapping,eyes,came,to,rest,on,india's,face,and,she,paused,<END>
india,was,breathing,fast,and,her,pale,lashless,eyes,were,fastened,on,scarlett's,face,with,a,deadly,coldness,<END>
if,it,won't,pain,you,too,much,india,she,broke,off,sarcastically,i'd,be,much,obliged,if,you'd,tell,me,why,you've,been,staring,at,me,all,evening,<END>
has,my,face,turned,green,or,something,<END>
it,won't,pain,me,to,tell,you,<END>
i'll,do,it,with,pleasure,said,india,and,her,eyes,glittered,<END>
i,hate,to,see,you,underrate,a,fine,man,like,mr,kennedy,when,if,you,knew,<END>
india,<END>
said,melanie,warningly,her,hands,clenching,on,her,sewing,<END>
i,think,i,know,my,husband,better,than,you,do,said,scarlett,the,prospect,of,a,quarrel,the,first,open,quarrel,she,had,ever,had,with,india,making,her,spirits,rise,and,her,nervousness,depart,<END>
melanie's,eyes,caught,india's,and,reluctantly,india,closed,her,lips,<END>
but,almost,instantly,she,spoke,again,and,her,voice,was,cold,with,hate,<END>
you,make,me,sick,scarlett,o'hara,talking,about,being,protected,<END>
you,don't,care,about,being,protected,<END>
if,you,did,you'd,never,have,exposed,yourself,as,you,have,done,all,these,months,prissing,yourself,about,this,town,showing,yourself,off,to,strange,men,hoping,they'll,admire,you,<END>
what,happened,to,you,this,afternoon,was,just,what,you,deserved,and,if,there,was,any,justice,you'd,have,gotten,worse,<END>
oh,india,hush,<END>
cried,melanie,<END>
let,her,talk,cried,scarlett,<END>
i'm,enjoying,it,<END>
i,always,knew,she,hated,me,and,she,was,too,much,of,a,hypocrite,to,admit,it,<END>
if,she,thought,anyone,would,admire,her,she'd,be,walking,the,streets,naked,from,dawn,till,dark,<END>
india,was,on,her,feet,her,lean,body,quivering,with,insult,<END>
i,do,hate,you,she,said,in,a,clear,but,trembling,voice,<END>
but,it,hasn't,been,hypocrisy,that's,kept,me,quiet,<END>
it's,something,you,can't,understand,not,possessing,any,any,common,courtesy,common,good,breeding,<END>
it's,the,realization,that,if,all,of,us,don't,hang,together,and,submerge,our,own,small,hates,we,can't,expect,to,beat,the,yankees,<END>
but,you,you,you've,done,all,you,could,to,lower,the,prestige,of,decent,people,working,and,bringing,shame,on,a,good,husband,giving,yankees,and,riffraff,the,right,to,laugh,at,us,and,make,insulting,remarks,about,our,lack,of,gentility,<END>
yankees,don't,know,that,you,aren't,one,of,us,and,have,never,been,<END>
yankees,haven't,sense,enough,to,know,that,you,haven't,any,gentility,<END>
and,when,you've,ridden,about,the,woods,exposing,yourself,to,attack,you've,exposed,every,well-behaved,woman,in,town,to,attack,by,putting,temptation,in,the,ways,of,darkies,and,mean,white,trash,<END>
and,you've,put,our,men,folks',lives,in,danger,because,they've,got,to,<END>

you,must,hush,<END>
she,doesn't,know,and,she,you,must,hush,<END>
you,promised,<END>
oh,girls,<END>
pleaded,miss,pittypat,her,lips,trembling,<END>
what,don't,i,know,<END>
scarlett,was,on,her,feet,furious,facing,the,coldly,blazing,india,and,the,imploring,melanie,<END>
guinea,hens,said,archie,suddenly,and,his,voice,was,contemptuous,<END>
before,anyone,could,rebuke,him,his,grizzled,head,went,up,sharply,and,he,rose,swiftly,<END>
somebody,comin',up,the,walk,<END>
'tain't,mr,wilkes,neither,<END>
cease,your,cackle,<END>
there,was,male,authority,in,his,voice,and,the,women,stood,suddenly,silent,anger,fading,swiftly,from,their,faces,as,he,stumped,across,the,room,to,the,door,<END>
who's,thar,<END>
he,questioned,before,the,caller,even,knocked,<END>
captain,butler,<END>
let,me,in,<END>
melanie,was,across,the,floor,so,swiftly,that,her,hoops,swayed,up,violently,revealing,her,pantalets,to,the,knees,and,before,archie,could,put,his,hand,on,the,knob,she,flung,the,door,open,<END>
rhett,butler,stood,in,the,doorway,his,black,slouch,hat,low,over,his,eyes,the,wild,wind,whipping,his,cape,about,him,in,snapping,folds,<END>
for,once,his,good,manners,had,deserted,him,<END>
he,neither,took,off,his,hat,nor,spoke,to,the,others,in,the,room,<END>
he,had,eyes,for,no,one,but,melanie,and,he,spoke,abruptly,without,greeting,<END>
where,have,they,gone,<END>
tell,me,quickly,<END>
it's,life,or,death,<END>
scarlett,and,pitty,startled,and,bewildered,looked,at,each,other,in,wonderment,and,like,a,lean,old,cat,india,streaked,across,the,room,to,melanie's,side,<END>
don't,tell,him,anything,she,cried,swiftly,<END>
he's,a,spy,a,scallawag,<END>
rhett,did,not,even,favor,her,with,a,glance,<END>
quickly,mrs,wilkes,<END>
there,may,still,be,time,<END>
melanie,seemed,in,a,paralysis,of,terror,and,only,stared,into,his,face,<END>
what,on,earth,began,scarlett,<END>
shet,yore,mouth,directed,archie,briefly,<END>
you,too,miss,melly,<END>
git,the,hell,out,of,here,you,damned,scallawag,<END>
no,archie,no,<END>
cried,melanie,and,she,put,a,shaking,hand,on,rhett's,arm,as,though,to,protect,him,from,archie,<END>
what,has,happened,<END>
how,did,how,did,you,know,<END>
on,rhett's,dark,face,impatience,fought,with,courtesy,<END>
good,god,mrs,wilkes,they've,all,been,under,suspicion,since,the,beginning,only,they've,been,too,clever,until,tonight,<END>
how,do,i,know,<END>
i,was,playing,poker,tonight,with,two,drunken,yankee,captains,and,they,let,it,out,<END>
the,yankees,knew,there'd,be,trouble,tonight,and,they've,prepared,for,it,<END>
the,fools,have,walked,into,a,trap,<END>
for,a,moment,it,was,as,though,melanie,swayed,under,the,impact,of,a,heavy,blow,and,rhett's,arm,went,around,her,waist,to,steady,her,<END>
don't,tell,him,<END>
he's,trying,to,trap,you,<END>
cried,india,glaring,at,rhett,<END>
didn't,you,hear,him,say,he'd,been,with,yankee,officers,tonight,<END>
still,rhett,did,not,look,at,her,<END>
his,eyes,were,bent,insistently,on,melanie's,white,face,<END>
tell,me,<END>
where,did,they,go,<END>
have,they,a,meeting,place,<END>
despite,her,fear,and,incomprehension,scarlett,thought,she,had,never,seen,a,blanker,more,expressionless,face,than,rhett's,but,evidently,melanie,saw,something,else,something,that,made,her,give,her,trust,<END>
she,straightened,her,small,body,away,from,the,steadying,arm,and,said,quietly,but,with,a,voice,that,shook,<END>
out,the,decatur,road,near,shantytown,<END>
they,meet,in,the,cellar,of,the,old,sullivan,plantation,the,one,that's,half-burned,<END>
thank,you,<END>
i'll,ride,fast,<END>
when,the,yankees,come,here,none,of,you,know,anything,<END>
he,was,gone,so,swiftly,his,black,cape,melting,into,the,night,that,they,could,hardly,realize,he,had,been,there,at,all,until,they,heard,the,spattering,of,gravel,and,the,mad,pounding,of,a,horse,going,off,at,full,gallop,<END>
the,yankees,coming,here,<END>
cried,pitty,and,her,small,feet,turning,under,her,she,collapsed,on,the,sofa,too,frightened,for,tears,<END>
what's,it,all,about,<END>
what,did,he,mean,<END>
if,you,don't,tell,me,i'll,go,crazy,<END>
scarlett,laid,hands,on,melanie,and,shook,her,violently,as,if,by,force,she,could,shake,an,answer,from,her,<END>
mean,<END>
it,means,you've,probably,been,the,cause,of,ashley's,and,mr,kennedy's,death,<END>
in,spite,of,the,agony,of,fear,there,was,a,note,of,triumph,in,india's,voice,<END>

trembling,they,obeyed,even,pitty,picking,up,a,sock,and,holding,it,in,shaking,fingers,while,her,eyes,wide,as,a,frightened,child's,went,around,the,circle,for,an,explanation,<END>
where,is,ashley,<END>

india's,pale,eyes,blazed,with,insane,malice,as,she,crumpled,and,straightened,the,torn,towel,she,had,been,mending,<END>
india,please,<END>
melanie,had,mastered,her,voice,but,her,white,shaken,face,and,tortured,eyes,showed,the,strain,under,which,she,was,laboring,<END>
scarlett,perhaps,we,should,have,told,you,but,but,you,had,been,through,so,much,this,afternoon,that,we,that,frank,didn't,think,and,you,were,always,so,outspoken,against,the,klan,<END>
the,klan,<END>
at,first,scarlett,spoke,the,word,as,if,she,had,never,heard,it,before,and,had,no,comprehension,of,its,meaning,and,then,<END>

we,were,afraid,it,would,upset,you,said,melanie,sorrowfully,<END>
then,that's,where,they,go,when,they're,supposed,to,be,at,the,political,meetings,<END>

and,our,men,have,walked,into,a,trap,<END>
and,if,what,butler,said,warn't,true,then,he's,a,spy,and,he,is,goin',to,turn,them,up,to,the,yankees,and,they'll,git,kilt,just,the,same,<END>

it's,all,yore,fault,and,thar's,blood,on,yore,hands,<END>
anger,wiped,out,the,fear,from,melanie's,face,as,she,saw,comprehension,come,slowly,across,scarlett's,face,and,then,horror,follow,swiftly,<END>
she,rose,and,put,her,hand,on,scarlett's,shoulder,<END>
another,such,word,and,you,go,out,of,this,house,archie,she,said,sternly,<END>
it's,not,her,fault,<END>
she,only,did,did,what,she,felt,she,had,to,do,<END>
and,our,men,did,what,they,felt,they,had,to,do,<END>
people,must,do,what,they,must,do,<END>
we,don't,all,think,alike,or,act,alike,and,it's,wrong,to,to,judge,others,by,ourselves,<END>
how,can,you,and,india,say,such,cruel,things,when,her,husband,as,well,as,mine,may,be,may,be,<END>
hark,<END>
interrupted,archie,softly,<END>
set,ma'm,<END>
thar's,horses,<END>
melanie,sank,into,a,chair,picked,up,one,of,ashley's,shirts,and,bowing,her,head,over,it,unconsciously,began,to,tear,the,frills,into,small,ribbons,<END>
the,sound,of,hooves,grew,louder,as,horses,trotted,up,to,the,house,<END>
there,was,the,jangling,of,bits,and,the,strain,of,leather,and,the,sound,of,voices,<END>
as,the,hooves,stopped,in,front,of,the,house,one,voice,rose,above,the,others,in,a,command,and,the,listeners,heard,feet,going,through,the,side,yard,toward,the,back,porch,<END>
they,felt,that,a,thousand,inimical,eyes,looked,at,them,through,the,unshaded,front,window,and,the,four,women,with,fear,in,their,hearts,bent,their,heads,and,plied,their,needles,<END>
scarlett's,heart,screamed,in,her,breast,i've,killed,ashley,<END>
i've,killed,him,<END>
and,in,that,wild,moment,she,did,not,even,think,that,she,might,have,killed,frank,too,<END>
she,had,no,room,in,her,mind,for,any,picture,save,that,of,ashley,lying,at,the,feet,of,yankee,cavalrymen,his,fair,hair,dappled,with,blood,<END>
as,the,harsh,rapid,knocking,sounded,at,the,door,she,looked,at,melanie,and,saw,come,over,the,small,strained,face,a,new,expression,an,expression,as,blank,as,she,had,just,seen,on,rhett,butler's,face,the,bland,blank,look,of,a,poker,player,bluffing,a,game,with,only,two,deuces,<END>
archie,open,the,door,she,said,quietly,<END>
slipping,his,knife,into,his,boot,top,and,loosening,the,pistol,in,his,trouser,band,archie,stumped,over,to,the,door,and,flung,it,open,<END>
pitty,gave,a,little,squeak,like,a,mouse,who,feels,the,trap,snap,down,as,she,saw,massed,in,the,doorway,a,yankee,captain,and,a,squad,of,bluecoats,<END>
but,the,others,said,nothing,<END>
scarlett,saw,with,the,faintest,feeling,of,relief,that,she,knew,this,officer,<END>
he,was,captain,tom,jaffery,one,of,rhett's,friends,<END>
she,had,sold,him,lumber,to,build,his,house,<END>
she,knew,him,to,be,a,gentleman,<END>
perhaps,as,he,was,a,gentleman,he,wouldn't,drag,them,away,to,prison,<END>
he,recognized,her,instantly,and,taking,off,his,hat,bowed,somewhat,embarrassed,<END>
good,evening,mrs,kennedy,<END>
and,which,of,you,ladies,is,mrs,<END>
wilkes,<END>
i,am,mrs,wilkes,answered,melanie,rising,and,for,all,her,smallness,dignity,flowed,from,her,<END>
and,to,what,do,i,owe,this,intrusion,<END>
the,eyes,of,the,captain,flickered,quickly,about,the,room,resting,for,an,instant,on,each,face,passing,quickly,from,their,faces,to,the,table,and,the,hat,rack,as,though,looking,for,signs,of,male,occupancy,<END>
i,should,like,to,speak,to,mr,wilkes,and,mr,kennedy,if,you,please,<END>
they,are,not,here,said,melanie,a,chill,in,her,soft,voice,<END>
are,you,sure,<END>
don't,you,question,miz,wilkes',word,said,archie,his,beard,bristling,<END>
i,beg,your,pardon,mrs,wilkes,<END>
i,meant,no,disrespect,<END>
if,you,give,me,your,word,i,will,not,search,the,house,<END>
you,have,my,word,<END>
but,search,if,you,like,<END>
they,are,at,a,meeting,downtown,at,mr,kennedy's,store,<END>
they,are,not,at,the,store,<END>
there,was,no,meeting,tonight,answered,the,captain,grimly,<END>
we,will,wait,outside,until,they,return,<END>
he,bowed,briefly,and,went,out,closing,the,door,behind,him,<END>
those,in,the,house,heard,a,sharp,order,muffled,by,the,wind,surround,the,house,<END>
a,man,at,each,window,and,door,<END>
there,was,a,tramping,of,feet,<END>
scarlett,checked,a,start,of,terror,as,she,dimly,saw,bearded,faces,peering,in,the,windows,at,them,<END>
melanie,sat,down,and,with,a,hand,that,did,not,tremble,reached,for,a,book,on,the,table,<END>
it,was,a,ragged,copy,of,les,miserables,that,book,which,caught,the,fancy,of,the,confederate,soldiers,<END>
they,had,read,it,by,camp-fire,light,and,took,some,grim,pleasure,in,calling,it,lee's,miserables,<END>
she,opened,it,at,the,middle,and,began,to,read,in,a,clear,monotonous,voice,<END>
sew,commanded,archie,in,a,hoarse,whisper,and,the,three,women,nerved,by,melanie's,cool,voice,picked,up,their,sewing,and,bowed,their,heads,<END>
how,long,melanie,read,beneath,that,circle,of,watching,eyes,scarlett,never,knew,but,it,seemed,hours,<END>
she,did,not,even,hear,a,word,that,melanie,read,<END>
now,she,was,beginning,to,think,of,frank,as,well,as,ashley,<END>
so,this,was,the,explanation,of,his,apparent,calm,this,evening,<END>
he,had,promised,her,he,would,have,nothing,to,do,with,the,klan,<END>
oh,this,was,just,the,kind,of,trouble,she,had,feared,would,come,upon,them,<END>
all,the,work,of,this,last,year,would,go,for,nothing,<END>
all,her,struggles,and,fears,and,labors,in,rain,and,cold,had,been,wasted,<END>
and,who,would,have,thought,that,spiritless,old,frank,would,get,himself,mixed,up,in,the,hot-headed,doings,of,the,klan,<END>
even,at,this,minute,he,might,be,dead,<END>
and,if,he,wasn't,dead,and,the,yankees,caught,him,he'd,be,hanged,<END>
and,ashley,too,<END>
her,nails,dug,into,her,palms,until,four,bright-red,crescents,showed,<END>
how,could,melanie,read,on,and,on,so,calmly,when,ashley,was,in,danger,of,being,hanged,<END>
when,he,might,be,dead,<END>
but,something,in,the,cool,soft,voice,reading,the,sorrows,of,jean,valjean,steadied,her,kept,her,from,leaping,to,her,feet,and,screaming,<END>
her,mind,fled,back,to,the,night,tony,fontaine,had,come,to,them,hunted,exhausted,without,money,<END>
if,he,had,not,reached,their,house,and,received,money,and,a,fresh,horse,he,would,have,been,hanged,long,since,<END>
if,frank,and,ashley,were,not,dead,at,this,very,minute,they,were,in,tony's,position,only,worse,<END>
with,the,house,surrounded,by,soldiers,they,couldn't,come,home,and,get,money,and,clothes,without,being,captured,<END>
and,probably,every,house,up,and,down,the,street,had,a,similar,guard,of,yankees,so,they,could,not,apply,to,friends,for,aid,<END>
even,now,they,might,be,riding,wildly,through,the,night,bound,for,texas,<END>
but,rhett,perhaps,rhett,had,reached,them,in,time,<END>
rhett,always,had,plenty,of,cash,in,his,pocket,<END>
perhaps,he,would,lend,them,enough,to,see,them,through,<END>
but,that,was,queer,<END>
why,should,rhett,bother,himself,about,ashley's,safety,<END>
certainly,he,disliked,him,certainly,he,professed,a,contempt,for,him,<END>
then,why,but,this,riddle,was,swallowed,up,in,a,renewed,fear,for,the,safety,of,ashley,and,frank,<END>
oh,it's,all,my,fault,<END>
she,wailed,to,herself,<END>
india,and,archie,spoke,the,truth,<END>
it's,all,my,fault,<END>
but,i,never,thought,either,of,them,was,foolish,enough,to,join,the,klan,<END>
and,i,never,thought,anything,would,really,happen,to,me,<END>
but,i,couldn't,have,done,otherwise,<END>
melly,spoke,the,truth,<END>
people,have,to,do,what,they,have,to,do,<END>
and,i,had,to,keep,the,mills,going,<END>
i,had,to,have,money,<END>
and,now,i'll,probably,lose,it,all,and,somehow,it's,all,my,fault,<END>
after,a,long,time,melanie's,voice,faltered,trailed,off,and,was,silent,<END>
she,turned,her,head,toward,the,window,and,stared,as,though,no,yankee,soldier,stared,back,from,behind,the,glass,<END>
the,others,raised,their,heads,caught,by,her,listening,pose,and,they,too,listened,<END>
there,was,a,sound,of,horses',feet,and,of,singing,deadened,by,the,closed,windows,and,doors,borne,away,by,the,wind,but,still,recognizable,<END>
it,was,the,most,hated,and,hateful,of,all,songs,the,song,about,sherman's,men,marching,through,georgia,and,rhett,butler,was,singing,it,<END>
hardly,had,he,finished,the,first,lines,when,two,other,voices,drunken,voices,assailed,him,enraged,foolish,voices,that,stumbled,over,words,and,blurred,them,together,<END>
there,was,a,quick,command,from,captain,jaffery,on,the,front,porch,and,the,rapid,tramp,of,feet,<END>
but,even,before,these,sounds,arose,the,ladies,looked,at,one,another,stunned,<END>
for,the,drunken,voices,expostulating,with,rhett,were,those,of,ashley,and,hugh,elsing,<END>
voices,rose,louder,on,the,front,walk,captain,jaffery's,curt,and,questioning,hugh's,shrill,with,foolish,laughter,rhett's,deep,and,reckless,and,ashley's,queer,unreal,shouting,what,the,hell,<END>
what,the,hell,<END>
that,can't,be,ashley,<END>
thought,scarlett,wildly,<END>
he,never,gets,drunk,<END>
and,rhett,why,when,rhett's,drunk,he,gets,quieter,and,quieter,never,loud,like,that,<END>
melanie,rose,and,with,her,archie,rose,<END>
they,heard,the,captain's,sharp,voice,these,two,men,are,under,arrest,<END>
and,archie's,hand,closed,over,his,pistol,butt,<END>
no,whispered,melanie,firmly,<END>
no,<END>
leave,it,to,me,<END>
there,was,in,her,face,the,same,look,scarlett,had,seen,that,day,at,tara,when,melanie,had,stood,at,the,top,of,the,steps,looking,down,at,the,dead,yankee,her,weak,wrist,weighed,down,by,the,heavy,saber,a,gentle,and,timid,soul,nerved,by,circumstances,to,the,caution,and,fury,of,a,tigress,<END>
she,threw,the,front,door,open,<END>
bring,him,in,captain,butler,she,called,in,a,clear,tone,that,bit,with,venom,<END>
i,suppose,you've,gotten,him,intoxicated,again,<END>
bring,him,in,<END>
from,the,dark,windy,walk,the,yankee,captain,spoke,i'm,sorry,mrs,wilkes,but,your,husband,and,mr,elsing,are,under,arrest,<END>
arrest,<END>
for,what,<END>
for,drunkenness,<END>
if,everyone,in,atlanta,was,arrested,for,drunkenness,the,whole,yankee,garrison,would,be,in,jail,continually,<END>
well,bring,him,in,captain,butler,that,is,if,you,can,walk,yourself,<END>
scarlett's,mind,was,not,working,quickly,and,for,a,brief,moment,nothing,made,sense,<END>
she,knew,neither,rhett,nor,ashley,was,drunk,and,she,knew,melanie,knew,they,were,not,drunk,<END>
yet,here,was,melanie,usually,so,gentle,and,refined,screaming,like,a,shrew,and,in,front,of,yankees,too,that,both,of,them,were,too,drunk,to,walk,<END>
there,was,a,short,mumbled,argument,punctuated,with,curses,and,uncertain,feet,ascended,the,stairs,<END>
in,the,doorway,appeared,ashley,white,faced,his,head,lolling,his,bright,hair,tousled,his,long,body,wrapped,from,neck,to,knees,in,rhett's,black,cape,<END>
hugh,elsing,and,rhett,none,too,steady,on,their,feet,supported,him,on,either,side,and,it,was,obvious,he,would,have,fallen,to,the,floor,but,for,their,aid,<END>
behind,them,came,the,yankee,captain,his,face,a,study,of,mingled,suspicion,and,amusement,<END>
he,stood,in,the,open,doorway,with,his,men,peering,curiously,over,his,shoulders,and,the,cold,wind,swept,the,house,<END>
scarlett,frightened,puzzled,glanced,at,melanie,and,back,to,the,sagging,ashley,and,then,half-comprehension,came,to,her,<END>
she,started,to,cry,out,but,he,can't,be,drunk,<END>
and,bit,back,the,words,<END>
she,realized,she,was,witnessing,a,play,a,desperate,play,on,which,lives,hinged,<END>
she,knew,she,was,not,part,of,it,nor,was,aunt,pitty,but,the,others,were,and,they,were,tossing,cues,to,one,another,like,actors,in,an,oft-rehearsed,drama,<END>
she,understood,only,half,but,she,understood,enough,to,keep,silent,<END>
put,him,in,the,chair,cried,melanie,indignantly,<END>
and,you,captain,butler,leave,this,house,immediately,<END>
how,dare,you,show,your,face,here,after,getting,him,in,this,condition,again,<END>
the,two,men,eased,ashley,into,a,rocker,and,rhett,swaying,caught,hold,of,the,back,of,the,chair,to,steady,himself,and,addressed,the,captain,with,pain,in,his,voice,<END>
that's,fine,thanks,i,get,isn't,it,<END>
for,keeping,the,police,from,getting,him,and,bringing,him,home,and,him,yelling,and,trying,to,claw,me,<END>
and,you,hugh,elsing,i'm,ashamed,of,you,<END>
what,will,your,poor,mother,say,<END>
drunk,and,out,with,a,a,yankee-loving,scallawag,like,captain,butler,<END>
and,oh,mr,wilkes,how,could,you,do,such,a,thing,<END>
melly,i,ain't,so,very,drunk,mumbled,ashley,and,with,the,words,fell,forward,and,lay,face,down,on,the,table,his,head,buried,in,his,arms,<END>
archie,take,him,to,his,room,and,put,him,to,bed,as,usual,ordered,melanie,<END>
aunt,pitty,please,run,and,fix,the,bed,and,oo-,oh,she,suddenly,burst,into,tears,<END>
oh,how,could,he,<END>
after,he,promised,<END>
archie,already,had,his,arm,under,ashley's,shoulder,and,pitty,frightened,and,uncertain,was,on,her,feet,when,the,captain,interposed,<END>
don't,touch,him,<END>
he's,under,arrest,<END>
sergeant,<END>
as,the,sergeant,stepped,into,the,room,his,rifle,at,trail,rhett,evidently,trying,to,steady,himself,put,a,hand,on,the,captain's,arm,and,with,difficulty,focused,his,eyes,<END>
tom,what,you,arresting,him,for,<END>
he,ain't,so,very,drunk,<END>
i've,seen,him,drunker,<END>
drunk,be,damned,cried,the,captain,<END>
he,can,lie,in,the,gutter,for,all,i,care,<END>
i'm,no,policeman,<END>
he,and,mr,elsing,are,under,arrest,for,complicity,in,a,klan,raid,at,shantytown,tonight,<END>
a,nigger,and,a,white,man,were,killed,<END>
mr,wilkes,was,the,ringleader,in,it,<END>
tonight,<END>
rhett,began,to,laugh,<END>
he,laughed,so,hard,that,he,sat,down,on,the,sofa,and,put,his,head,in,his,hands,<END>
not,tonight,tom,he,said,when,he,could,speak,<END>
these,two,have,been,with,me,tonight,ever,since,eight,o'clock,when,they,were,supposed,to,be,at,the,meeting,<END>
with,you,rhett,<END>
but,a,frown,came,over,the,captain's,forehead,and,he,looked,uncertainly,at,the,snoring,ashley,and,his,weeping,wife,<END>
but,where,were,you,<END>
i,don't,like,to,say,and,rhett,shot,a,look,of,drunken,cunning,at,melanie,<END>
you'd,better,say,<END>
le's,go,out,on,the,porch,and,i'll,tell,you,where,we,were,<END>
you'll,tell,me,now,<END>
hate,to,say,it,in,front,of,ladies,<END>
if,you,ladies'll,step,out,of,the,room,<END>
i,won't,go,cried,melanie,dabbing,angrily,at,her,eyes,with,her,handkerchief,<END>
i,have,a,right,to,know,<END>
where,was,my,husband,<END>
at,belle,watling's,sporting,house,said,rhett,looking,abashed,<END>
he,was,there,and,hugh,and,frank,kennedy,and,dr,meade,and,and,a,whole,lot,of,them,<END>
had,a,party,<END>
big,party,<END>
champagne,<END>
girls,<END>
at,at,belle,watling's,<END>
melanie's,voice,rose,until,it,cracked,with,such,pain,that,all,eyes,turned,frightenedly,to,her,<END>
her,hand,went,clutching,at,her,bosom,and,before,archie,could,catch,her,she,had,fainted,<END>
then,a,hubbub,ensued,archie,picking,her,up,india,running,to,the,kitchen,for,water,pitty,and,scarlett,fanning,her,and,slapping,her,wrists,while,hugh,elsing,shouted,over,and,over,now,you've,done,it,<END>
now,you've,done,it,<END>
now,it'll,be,all,over,town,said,rhett,savagely,<END>
i,hope,you're,satisfied,tom,<END>
there,won't,be,a,wife,in,atlanta,who'll,speak,to,her,husband,tomorrow,<END>
rhett,i,had,no,idea,though,the,chill,wind,was,blowing,through,the,open,door,on,his,back,the,captain,was,perspiring,<END>
look,here,<END>
you,take,an,oath,they,were,at,er,at,belle's,<END>

i,don't,want,to,ever,lay,eyes,or,hands,on,him,again,after,this,night,<END>
pitty's,hand,trembled,so,that,the,lamp,was,a,menace,to,the,safety,of,the,house,but,she,held,it,and,trotted,ahead,toward,the,dark,bedroom,<END>
archie,with,a,grunt,got,an,arm,under,ashley,and,raised,him,<END>
but,i've,got,to,arrest,these,men,<END>
rhett,turned,in,the,dim,hallway,<END>
arrest,them,in,the,morning,then,<END>

india,bowed,coldly,and,putting,her,hand,upon,the,door,knob,intimated,silently,that,his,speedy,retirement,would,be,welcome,<END>
the,captain,and,the,sergeant,backed,out,hugh,elsing,with,them,and,she,slammed,the,door,behind,them,<END>

scarlett,her,knees,shaking,caught,hold,of,the,chair,in,which,ashley,had,been,sitting,to,steady,herself,<END>

you,fool,<END>
did,you,think,he,was,really,drunk,<END>
india,snapped,down,the,last,shade,and,started,on,flying,feet,for,the,bedroom,with,scarlett,close,behind,her,her,heart,in,her,throat,<END>

cried,both,girls,together,<END>
no,just,fainted,from,loss,of,blood,<END>

cried,india,<END>
let,me,get,to,him,<END>
let,me,pass,<END>
why,did,you,bring,him,here,to,be,arrested,<END>
he,was,too,weak,to,travel,<END>

no,said,india,her,pale,eyes,glittering,<END>

india,shot,one,more,quick,anguished,look,at,ashley,and,wrapping,her,cape,about,her,ran,lightly,down,the,hall,to,the,back,door,and,let,herself,out,quietly,into,the,night,<END>
scarlett,straining,her,eyes,past,rhett,felt,her,heart,beat,again,as,she,saw,ashley's,eyes,open,<END>
melanie,snatched,a,folded,towel,from,the,washstand,rack,and,pressed,it,against,his,streaming,shoulder,and,he,smiled,up,weakly,reassuringly,into,her,face,<END>
scarlett,felt,rhett's,hard,penetrating,eyes,upon,her,knew,that,her,heart,was,plain,upon,her,face,but,she,did,not,care,<END>

how,could,a,man,bleed,so,much,and,still,live,<END>
but,thank,god,there,was,no,bubble,of,blood,at,his,lips,oh,those,frothy,red,bubbles,forerunners,of,death,that,she,knew,so,well,from,the,dreadful,day,of,the,battle,at,peachtree,creek,when,the,wounded,had,died,on,aunt,pitty's,lawn,with,bloody,mouths,<END>
brace,up,said,rhett,and,there,was,a,hard,faintly,jeering,note,in,his,voice,<END>
he,won't,die,<END>
now,go,take,the,lamp,and,hold,it,for,mrs,wilkes,<END>
i,need,archie,to,run,errands,<END>

i,ain't,takin',no,orders,from,you,he,said,briefly,shifting,his,wad,of,tobacco,to,the,other,cheek,<END>
you,do,what,he,says,said,melanie,sternly,and,do,it,quickly,<END>
do,everything,captain,butler,says,<END>
scarlett,take,the,lamp,<END>
scarlett,went,forward,and,took,the,lamp,holding,it,in,both,hands,to,keep,from,dropping,it,<END>
ashley's,eyes,had,closed,again,<END>
his,bare,chest,heaved,up,slowly,and,sank,quickly,and,the,red,stream,seeped,from,between,melanie's,small,frantic,fingers,<END>
dimly,she,heard,archie,stump,across,the,room,to,rhett,and,heard,rhett's,low,rapid,words,<END>
her,mind,was,so,fixed,upon,ashley,that,of,the,first,half-whispered,words,of,rhett,she,only,heard,take,my,horse,<END>
tied,outside,<END>
ride,like,hell,<END>
archie,mumbled,some,question,and,scarlett,heard,rhett,reply,the,old,sullivan,plantation,<END>
you'll,find,the,robes,pushed,up,the,biggest,chimney,<END>
burn,them,<END>
um,grunted,archie,<END>
and,there's,two,men,in,the,cellar,<END>
pack,them,over,the,horse,as,best,you,can,and,take,them,to,that,vacant,lot,behind,belle's,the,one,between,her,house,and,the,railroad,tracks,<END>
be,careful,<END>
if,anyone,sees,you,you'll,hang,as,well,as,the,rest,of,us,<END>
put,them,in,that,lot,and,put,pistols,near,them,in,their,hands,<END>
here,take,mine,<END>
scarlett,looking,across,the,room,saw,rhett,reach,under,his,coat,tails,and,produce,two,revolvers,which,archie,took,and,shoved,into,his,waist,band,<END>
fire,one,shot,from,each,<END>
it's,got,to,appear,like,a,plain,case,of,shooting,<END>
you,understand,<END>
archie,nodded,as,if,he,understood,perfectly,and,an,unwilling,gleam,of,respect,shone,in,his,cold,eye,<END>
but,understanding,was,far,from,scarlett,<END>
the,last,half-hour,had,been,so,nightmarish,that,she,felt,nothing,would,ever,be,plain,and,clear,again,<END>
however,rhett,seemed,in,perfect,command,of,the,bewildering,situation,and,that,was,a,small,comfort,<END>
archie,turned,to,go,and,then,swung,about,and,his,one,eye,went,questioningly,to,rhett's,face,<END>
him,<END>
yes,<END>
archie,grunted,and,spat,on,the,floor,<END>
hell,to,pay,he,said,as,he,stumped,down,the,hall,to,the,back,door,<END>
something,in,the,last,low,interchange,of,words,made,a,new,fear,and,suspicion,rise,up,in,scarlett's,breast,like,a,chill,ever-swelling,bubble,<END>
when,that,bubble,broke,<END>
where's,frank,<END>
she,cried,<END>
rhett,came,swiftly,across,the,room,to,the,bed,his,big,body,swinging,as,lightly,and,noiselessly,as,a,cat's,<END>
all,in,good,time,he,said,and,smiled,briefly,<END>
steady,that,lamp,scarlett,<END>
you,don't,want,to,burn,mr,wilkes,up,<END>
miss,melly,<END>
melanie,looked,up,like,a,good,little,soldier,awaiting,a,command,and,so,tense,was,the,situation,it,did,not,occur,to,her,that,for,the,first,time,rhett,was,calling,her,familiarly,by,the,name,which,only,family,and,old,friends,used,<END>
i,beg,your,pardon,i,mean,mrs,wilkes,<END>
oh,captain,butler,do,not,ask,my,pardon,<END>
i,should,feel,honored,if,you,called,me,'melly',without,the,miss,<END>
i,feel,as,though,you,were,my,my,brother,or,or,my,cousin,<END>
how,kind,you,are,and,how,clever,<END>
how,can,i,ever,thank,you,enough,<END>
thank,you,said,rhett,and,for,a,moment,he,looked,almost,embarrassed,<END>
i,should,never,presume,so,far,but,miss,melly,and,his,voice,was,apologetic,i'm,sorry,i,had,to,say,that,mr,wilkes,was,in,belle,watling's,house,<END>
i'm,sorry,to,have,involved,him,and,the,others,in,such,a,a,but,i,had,to,think,fast,when,i,rode,away,from,here,and,that,was,the,only,plan,that,occurred,to,me,<END>
i,knew,my,word,would,be,accepted,because,i,have,so,many,friends,among,the,yankee,officers,<END>
they,do,me,the,dubious,honor,of,thinking,me,almost,one,of,them,because,they,know,my,shall,we,call,it,my,'unpopularity',among,my,townsmen,<END>
and,you,see,i,was,playing,poker,in,belle's,bar,earlier,in,the,evening,<END>
there,are,a,dozen,yankee,soldiers,who,can,testify,to,that,<END>
and,belle,and,her,girls,will,gladly,lie,themselves,black,in,the,face,and,say,mr,wilkes,and,the,others,were,upstairs,all,evening,<END>
and,the,yankees,will,believe,them,<END>
yankees,are,queer,that,way,<END>
it,won't,occur,to,them,that,women,of,their,profession,are,capable,of,intense,loyalty,or,patriotism,<END>
the,yankees,wouldn't,take,the,word,of,a,single,nice,atlanta,lady,as,to,the,whereabouts,of,the,men,who,were,supposed,to,be,at,the,meeting,tonight,but,they,will,take,the,word,of,fancy,ladies,<END>
and,i,think,that,between,the,word,of,honor,of,a,scallawag,and,a,dozen,fancy,ladies,we,may,have,a,chance,of,getting,the,men,off,<END>
there,was,a,sardonic,grin,on,his,face,at,the,last,words,but,it,faded,as,melanie,turned,up,to,him,a,face,that,blazed,with,gratitude,<END>
captain,butler,you,are,so,smart,<END>
i,wouldn't,have,cared,if,you'd,said,they,were,in,hell,itself,tonight,if,it,saves,them,<END>
for,i,know,and,every,one,else,who,matters,knows,that,my,husband,was,never,in,a,dreadful,place,like,that,<END>
well,began,rhett,awkwardly,as,a,matter,of,fact,he,was,at,belle's,tonight,<END>
melanie,drew,herself,up,coldly,<END>
you,can,never,make,me,believe,such,a,lie,<END>
please,miss,melly,<END>
let,me,explain,<END>
when,i,got,out,to,the,old,sullivan,place,tonight,i,found,mr,wilkes,wounded,and,with,him,were,hugh,elsing,and,dr,meade,and,old,man,merriwether,<END>
not,the,old,gentleman,<END>
cried,scarlett,<END>
men,are,never,too,old,to,be,fools,<END>
and,your,uncle,henry,<END>
oh,mercy,<END>
cried,aunt,pitty,<END>
the,others,had,scattered,after,the,brush,with,the,troops,and,the,crowd,that,stuck,together,had,come,to,the,sullivan,place,to,hide,their,robes,in,the,chimney,and,to,see,how,badly,mr,wilkes,was,hurt,<END>
but,for,his,wound,they'd,be,headed,for,texas,by,now,all,of,them,but,he,couldn't,ride,far,and,they,wouldn't,leave,him,<END>
it,was,necessary,to,prove,that,they,had,been,somewhere,instead,of,where,they,had,been,and,so,i,took,them,by,back,ways,to,belle,watling's,<END>
oh,i,see,<END>
i,do,beg,your,pardon,for,my,rudeness,captain,butler,<END>
i,see,now,it,was,necessary,to,take,them,there,but,oh,captain,butler,people,must,have,seen,you,going,in,<END>
no,one,saw,us,<END>
we,went,in,through,a,private,back,entrance,that,opens,on,the,railroad,tracks,<END>
it's,always,dark,and,locked,<END>
then,how,<END>
i,have,a,key,said,rhett,laconically,and,his,eyes,met,melanie's,evenly,<END>
as,the,full,impact,of,the,meaning,smote,her,melanie,became,so,embarrassed,that,she,fumbled,with,the,bandage,until,it,slid,off,the,wound,entirely,<END>
i,did,not,mean,to,pry,she,said,in,a,muffled,voice,her,white,face,reddening,as,she,hastily,pressed,the,towel,back,into,place,<END>
i,regret,having,to,tell,a,lady,such,a,thing,<END>
then,it's,true,<END>
thought,scarlett,with,an,odd,pang,<END>
then,he,does,live,with,that,dreadful,watling,creature,<END>
he,does,own,her,house,<END>
i,saw,belle,and,explained,to,her,<END>
we,gave,her,a,list,of,the,men,who,were,out,tonight,and,she,and,her,girls,will,testify,that,they,were,all,in,her,house,tonight,<END>
then,to,make,our,exit,more,conspicuous,she,called,the,two,desperadoes,who,keep,order,at,her,place,and,had,us,dragged,downstairs,fighting,and,through,the,barroom,and,thrown,out,into,the,street,as,brawling,drunks,who,were,disturbing,the,place,<END>
he,grinned,reminiscently,<END>
dr,meade,did,not,make,a,very,convincing,drunk,<END>
it,hurt,his,dignity,to,even,be,in,such,a,place,<END>
but,your,uncle,henry,and,old,man,merriwether,were,excellent,<END>
the,stage,lost,two,great,actors,when,they,did,not,take,up,the,drama,<END>
they,seemed,to,enjoy,the,affair,<END>
i'm,afraid,your,uncle,henry,has,a,black,eye,due,to,mr,merriwether's,zeal,for,his,part,<END>
he,<END>
the,back,door,swung,open,and,india,entered,followed,by,old,dr,dean,his,long,white,hair,tumbled,his,worn,leather,bag,bulging,under,his,cape,<END>
he,nodded,briefly,but,without,words,to,those,present,and,quickly,lifted,the,bandage,from,ashley's,shoulder,<END>
too,high,for,the,lung,he,said,<END>
if,it,hasn't,splintered,his,collar,bone,it's,not,so,serious,<END>
get,me,plenty,of,towels,ladies,and,cotton,if,you,have,it,and,some,brandy,<END>
rhett,took,the,lamp,from,scarlett,and,set,it,on,the,table,as,melanie,and,india,sped,about,obeying,the,doctor's,orders,<END>
you,can't,do,anything,here,<END>
come,into,the,parlor,by,the,fire,<END>
he,took,her,arm,and,propelled,her,from,the,room,<END>
there,was,a,gentleness,foreign,to,him,in,both,hand,and,voice,<END>
you've,had,a,rotten,day,haven't,you,<END>
she,allowed,herself,to,be,led,into,the,front,room,and,though,she,stood,on,the,hearth,rug,in,front,of,the,fire,she,began,to,shiver,<END>
the,bubble,of,suspicion,in,her,breast,was,swelling,larger,now,<END>
it,was,more,than,a,suspicion,<END>
it,was,almost,a,certainty,and,a,terrible,certainty,<END>
she,looked,up,into,rhett's,immobile,face,and,for,a,moment,she,could,not,speak,<END>
then,<END>
was,frank,at,belle,watling's,<END>
no,<END>
rhett's,voice,was,blunt,<END>
archie's,carrying,him,to,the,vacant,lot,near,belle's,<END>

chapter,xlvi,<END>
few,families,in,the,north,end,of,town,slept,that,night,for,the,news,of,the,disaster,to,the,klan,and,rhett's,stratagem,spread,swiftly,on,silent,feet,as,the,shadowy,form,of,india,wilkes,slipped,through,back,yards,whispered,urgently,through,kitchen,doors,and,slipped,away,into,the,windy,darkness,<END>
and,in,her,path,she,left,fear,and,desperate,hope,<END>
from,without,houses,looked,black,and,silent,and,wrapped,in,sleep,but,within,voices,whispered,vehemently,into,the,dawn,<END>
not,only,those,involved,in,the,night's,raid,but,every,member,of,the,klan,was,ready,for,flight,and,in,almost,every,stable,along,peachtree,street,horses,stood,saddled,in,the,darkness,pistols,in,holsters,and,food,in,saddlebags,<END>
all,that,prevented,a,wholesale,exodus,was,india's,whispered,message,captain,butler,says,not,to,run,<END>

it,may,be,a,trap,<END>
and,women's,voices,implored,don't,go,<END>
if,he,saved,ashley,and,hugh,he,may,save,everybody,<END>

earlier,in,the,night,the,soldiers,had,knocked,at,a,dozen,doors,and,those,who,could,not,or,would,not,tell,where,they,had,been,that,night,were,marched,off,under,arrest,<END>
rene,picard,and,one,of,mrs,merriwether's,nephews,and,the,simmons,boys,and,andy,bonnell,were,among,those,who,spent,the,night,in,jail,<END>

riding,hard,for,home,they,were,arrested,before,they,learned,of,rhett's,plan,<END>
fortunately,they,all,replied,to,questions,that,where,they,had,been,that,night,was,their,own,business,and,not,that,of,any,damned,yankees,<END>
they,had,been,locked,up,for,further,questioning,in,the,morning,<END>
old,man,merriwether,and,uncle,henry,hamilton,declared,shamelessly,that,they,had,spent,the,evening,at,belle,watling's,sporting,house,and,when,captain,jaffery,remarked,irritably,that,they,were,too,old,for,such,goings,on,they,wanted,to,fight,him,<END>
belle,watling,herself,answered,captain,jaffery's,summons,and,before,he,could,make,known,his,mission,she,shouted,that,the,house,was,closed,for,the,night,<END>
a,passel,of,quarrelsome,drunks,had,called,in,the,early,part,of,the,evening,and,had,fought,one,another,torn,the,place,up,broken,her,finest,mirrors,and,so,alarmed,the,young,ladies,that,all,business,had,been,suspended,for,the,night,<END>

captain,jaffery,acutely,conscious,of,the,grins,of,his,men,and,feeling,helplessly,that,he,was,fighting,a,mist,declared,angrily,that,he,wanted,neither,the,young,ladies,nor,a,drink,and,demanded,if,belle,knew,the,names,of,her,destructive,customers,<END>
oh,yes,belle,knew,them,<END>
they,were,her,regulars,<END>

everyone,knew,the,details,of,the,raid,the,killing,of,frank,kennedy,and,crippled,tommy,wellburn,and,how,ashley,was,wounded,in,carrying,frank's,body,away,<END>
some,of,the,feeling,of,bitter,hatred,the,women,bore,scarlett,for,her,share,in,the,tragedy,was,mitigated,by,the,knowledge,that,her,husband,was,dead,and,she,knew,it,and,could,not,admit,it,and,have,the,poor,comfort,of,claiming,his,body,<END>
until,morning,light,disclosed,the,bodies,and,the,authorities,notified,her,she,must,know,nothing,<END>

the,men,felt,less,humiliation,at,taking,their,lives,from,belle,than,the,women,did,for,many,of,them,thought,her,a,good,sort,<END>
but,they,were,stung,that,they,must,owe,lives,and,freedom,to,rhett,butler,a,speculator,and,a,scallawag,<END>
belle,and,rhett,the,town's,best-known,fancy,woman,and,the,town's,most,hated,man,<END>
and,they,must,be,under,obligation,to,them,<END>
another,thought,that,stung,them,to,impotent,wrath,was,the,knowledge,that,the,yankees,and,carpetbaggers,would,laugh,<END>
oh,how,they,would,laugh,<END>
twelve,of,the,town's,most,prominent,citizens,revealed,as,habitual,frequenters,of,belle,watling's,sporting,house,<END>
two,of,them,killed,in,a,fight,over,a,cheap,little,girl,others,ejected,from,the,place,as,too,drunk,to,be,tolerated,even,by,belle,and,some,under,arrest,refusing,to,admit,they,were,there,when,everyone,knew,they,were,there,<END>
atlanta,was,right,in,fearing,that,the,yankees,would,laugh,<END>
they,had,squirmed,too,long,beneath,southern,coldness,and,contempt,and,now,they,exploded,with,hilarity,<END>
officers,woke,comrades,and,retailed,the,news,<END>
husbands,roused,wives,at,dawn,and,told,them,as,much,as,could,be,decently,told,to,women,<END>
and,the,women,dressing,hastily,knocked,on,their,neighbors',doors,and,spread,the,story,<END>
the,yankee,ladies,were,charmed,with,it,all,and,laughed,until,tears,ran,down,their,faces,<END>
this,was,southern,chivalry,and,gallantry,for,you,<END>
maybe,those,women,who,carried,their,heads,so,high,and,snubbed,all,attempts,at,friendliness,wouldn't,be,so,uppity,now,that,everyone,knew,where,their,husbands,spent,their,time,when,they,were,supposed,to,be,at,political,meetings,<END>
political,meetings,<END>
well,that,was,funny,<END>
but,even,as,they,laughed,they,expressed,regret,for,scarlett,and,her,tragedy,<END>
after,all,scarlett,was,a,lady,and,one,of,the,few,ladies,in,atlanta,who,were,nice,to,yankees,<END>
she,had,already,won,their,sympathy,by,the,fact,that,she,had,to,work,because,her,husband,couldn't,or,wouldn't,support,her,properly,<END>
even,though,her,husband,was,a,sorry,one,it,was,dreadful,that,the,poor,thing,should,discover,he,had,been,untrue,to,her,<END>
and,it,was,doubly,dreadful,that,his,death,should,occur,simultaneously,with,the,discovery,of,his,infidelity,<END>
after,all,a,poor,husband,was,better,than,no,husband,at,all,and,the,yankee,ladies,decided,they'd,be,extra,nice,to,scarlett,<END>
but,the,others,mrs,meade,mrs,merriwether,mrs,elsing,tommy,wellburn's,widow,and,most,of,all,mrs,ashley,wilkes,they'd,laugh,in,their,faces,every,time,they,saw,them,<END>
that,would,teach,them,a,little,courtesy,<END>
much,of,the,whispering,that,went,on,in,the,dark,rooms,on,the,north,side,of,town,that,night,was,on,this,same,subject,<END>
atlanta,ladies,vehemently,told,their,husbands,that,they,did,not,care,a,rap,what,the,yankees,thought,<END>
but,inwardly,they,felt,that,running,an,indian,gantlet,would,be,infinitely,preferable,to,suffering,the,ordeal,of,yankee,grins,and,not,being,able,to,tell,the,truth,about,their,husbands,<END>
dr,meade,beside,himself,with,outraged,dignity,at,the,position,into,which,rhett,had,jockeyed,him,and,the,others,told,mrs,meade,that,but,for,the,fact,that,it,would,implicate,the,others,he,would,rather,confess,and,be,hanged,than,say,he,had,been,at,belle's,house,<END>
it,is,an,insult,to,you,mrs,meade,he,fumed,<END>
but,everyone,will,know,you,weren't,there,for,for,<END>
the,yankees,won't,know,<END>
they'll,have,to,believe,it,if,we,save,our,necks,<END>
and,they'll,laugh,<END>
the,very,thought,that,anyone,will,believe,it,and,laugh,infuriates,me,<END>
and,it,insults,you,because,my,dear,i,have,always,been,faithful,to,you,<END>
i,know,that,and,in,the,darkness,mrs,meade,smiled,and,slipped,a,thin,hand,into,the,doctor's,<END>
but,i'd,rather,it,were,really,true,than,have,one,hair,of,your,head,in,danger,<END>
mrs,meade,do,you,know,what,you,are,saying,<END>
cried,the,doctor,aghast,at,the,unsuspected,realism,of,his,wife,<END>
yes,i,know,<END>
i've,lost,darcy,and,i've,lost,phil,and,you,are,all,i,have,and,rather,than,lose,you,i'd,have,you,take,up,your,permanent,abode,at,that,place,<END>
you,are,distrait,<END>
you,cannot,know,what,you,are,saying,<END>
you,old,fool,said,mrs,meade,tenderly,and,laid,her,head,against,his,sleeve,<END>
dr,meade,fumed,into,silence,and,stroked,her,cheek,and,then,exploded,again,<END>
and,to,be,under,obligation,to,that,butler,man,<END>
hanging,would,be,easy,compared,to,that,<END>
no,not,even,if,i,owe,him,my,life,can,i,be,polite,to,him,<END>
his,insolence,is,monumental,and,his,shamelessness,about,his,profiteering,makes,me,boil,<END>
to,owe,my,life,to,a,man,who,never,went,in,the,army,<END>
melly,said,he,enlisted,after,atlanta,fell,<END>
it's,a,lie,<END>
miss,melly,will,believe,any,plausible,scoundrel,<END>
and,what,i,can't,understand,is,why,he,is,doing,all,this,going,to,all,this,trouble,<END>
i,hate,to,say,it,but,well,there's,always,been,talk,about,him,and,mrs,kennedy,<END>
i've,seen,them,coming,in,from,rides,together,too,often,this,last,year,<END>
he,must,have,done,it,because,of,her,<END>
if,it,was,because,of,scarlett,he,wouldn't,have,lifted,his,hand,<END>
he'd,have,been,glad,to,see,frank,kennedy,hanged,<END>
i,think,it's,because,of,melly,<END>
mrs,meade,you,can't,be,insinuating,that,there's,ever,been,anything,between,those,two,<END>
oh,don't,be,silly,<END>
but,she's,always,been,unaccountably,fond,of,him,ever,since,he,tried,to,get,ashley,exchanged,during,the,war,<END>
and,i,must,say,this,for,him,he,never,smiles,in,that,nasty-nice,way,when,he's,with,her,<END>
he's,just,as,pleasant,and,thoughtful,as,can,be,really,a,different,man,<END>
you,can,tell,by,the,way,he,acts,with,melly,that,he,could,be,decent,if,he,wanted,to,<END>
now,my,idea,of,why,he's,doing,all,this,is,she,paused,<END>
doctor,you,won't,like,my,idea,<END>
i,don't,like,anything,about,this,whole,affair,<END>
well,i,think,he,did,it,partly,for,melly's,sake,but,mostly,because,he,thought,it,would,be,a,huge,joke,on,us,all,<END>
we've,hated,him,so,much,and,showed,it,so,plainly,and,now,he's,got,us,in,a,fix,where,all,of,you,have,your,choice,of,saying,you,were,at,that,watling,woman's,house,and,shaming,yourself,and,wives,before,the,yankees,or,telling,the,truth,and,getting,hanged,<END>
and,he,knows,we'll,all,be,under,obligation,to,him,and,his,mistress,and,that,we'd,almost,rather,be,hanged,than,be,obliged,to,them,<END>
oh,i'll,wager,he's,enjoying,it,<END>
the,doctor,groaned,<END>
he,did,look,amused,when,he,took,us,upstairs,in,that,place,<END>
doctor,mrs,meade,hesitated,what,did,it,look,like,<END>
what,are,you,saying,mrs,<END>
meade,<END>
her,house,<END>
what,did,it,look,like,<END>
are,there,cut-glass,chandeliers,<END>
and,red,plush,curtains,and,dozens,of,full-length,gilt,mirrors,<END>
and,were,the,girls,were,they,unclothed,<END>
good,god,<END>
cried,the,doctor,thunderstruck,for,it,had,never,occurred,to,him,that,the,curiosity,of,a,chaste,woman,concerning,her,unchaste,sisters,was,so,devouring,<END>
how,can,you,ask,such,immodest,questions,<END>
you,are,not,yourself,<END>
i,will,mix,you,a,sedative,<END>
i,don't,want,a,sedative,<END>
i,want,to,know,<END>
oh,dear,this,is,my,only,chance,to,know,what,a,bad,house,looks,like,and,now,you,are,mean,enough,not,to,tell,me,<END>
i,noticed,nothing,<END>
i,assure,you,i,was,too,embarrassed,at,finding,myself,in,such,a,place,to,take,note,of,my,surroundings,said,the,doctor,formally,more,upset,at,this,unsuspected,revelation,of,his,wife's,character,than,he,had,been,by,all,the,previous,events,of,the,evening,<END>
if,you,will,excuse,me,now,i,will,try,to,get,some,sleep,<END>
well,go,to,sleep,then,she,answered,disappointment,in,her,tones,<END>
then,as,the,doctor,leaned,over,to,remove,his,boots,her,voice,spoke,from,the,darkness,with,renewed,cheerfulness,<END>
i,imagine,dolly,has,gotten,it,all,out,of,old,man,merriwether,and,she,can,tell,me,about,it,<END>
good,heavens,mrs,meade,<END>
do,you,mean,to,tell,me,that,nice,women,talk,about,such,things,among,them,<END>
oh,go,to,bed,said,mrs,meade,<END>
it,sleeted,the,next,day,but,as,the,wintry,twilight,drew,on,the,icy,particles,stopped,falling,and,a,cold,wind,blew,<END>
wrapped,in,her,cloak,melanie,went,bewilderedly,down,her,front,walk,behind,a,strange,negro,coachman,who,had,summoned,her,mysteriously,to,a,closed,carriage,waiting,in,front,of,the,house,<END>
as,she,came,up,to,the,carriage,the,door,was,opened,and,she,saw,a,woman,in,the,dim,interior,<END>
leaning,closer,peering,inside,melanie,questioned,who,is,it,<END>
won't,you,come,in,the,house,<END>
it's,so,cold,<END>
please,come,in,here,and,set,with,me,a,minute,miz,wilkes,came,a,faintly,familiar,voice,an,embarrassed,voice,from,the,depths,of,the,carriage,<END>
oh,you're,miss,mrs,watling,<END>
cried,melanie,<END>
i,did,so,want,to,see,you,<END>
you,must,come,in,the,house,<END>
i,can't,do,that,miz,wilkes,<END>
belle,watling's,voice,sounded,scandalized,<END>
you,come,in,here,and,set,a,minute,with,me,<END>
melanie,entered,the,carriage,and,the,coachman,closed,the,door,behind,her,<END>
she,sat,down,beside,belle,and,reached,for,her,hand,<END>
how,can,i,ever,thank,you,enough,for,what,you,did,today,<END>
how,can,any,of,us,thank,you,enough,<END>
miz,wilkes,you,hadn't,ought,of,sent,me,that,note,this,mornin',<END>
not,that,i,wasn't,proud,to,have,a,note,from,you,but,the,yankees,might,have,got,it,<END>
and,as,for,sayin',you,was,goin',to,call,on,me,to,thank,me,why,miz,wilkes,you,must,of,lost,your,mind,<END>
the,very,idea,<END>
i,come,up,here,as,soon,as,'twas,dark,to,tell,you,you,mustn't,think,of,any,sech,thing,<END>
why,i,why,you,it,wouldn't,be,fittin',at,all,<END>
it,wouldn't,be,fitting,for,me,to,call,and,thank,a,kind,woman,who,saved,my,husband's,life,<END>
oh,shucks,miz,wilkes,<END>
you,know,what,i,mean,<END>
melanie,was,silent,for,a,moment,embarrassed,by,the,implication,<END>
somehow,this,handsome,sedately,dressed,woman,sitting,in,the,darkness,of,the,carriage,didn't,look,and,talk,as,she,imagined,a,bad,woman,the,madam,of,a,house,should,look,and,talk,<END>
she,sounded,like,well,a,little,common,and,countrified,but,nice,and,warm,hearted,<END>
you,were,wonderful,before,the,provost,marshal,today,mrs,watling,<END>
you,and,the,other,your,the,young,ladies,certainly,saved,our,men's,lives,<END>
mr,wilkes,was,the,wonderful,one,<END>
i,don't,know,how,he,even,stood,up,and,told,his,story,much,less,look,as,cool,as,he,done,<END>
he,was,sure,bleedin',like,a,pig,when,i,seen,him,last,night,<END>
is,he,goin',to,be,all,right,miz,wilkes,<END>
yes,thank,you,<END>
the,doctor,says,it's,just,a,flesh,wound,though,he,did,lose,a,tremendous,lot,of,blood,<END>
this,morning,he,was,well,he,was,pretty,well,laced,with,brandy,or,he'd,never,have,had,the,strength,to,go,through,with,it,all,so,well,<END>
but,it,was,you,mrs,watling,who,saved,them,<END>
when,you,got,mad,and,talked,about,the,broken,mirrors,you,sounded,so,so,convincing,<END>
thank,you,ma'm,<END>
but,i,i,thought,captain,butler,done,mighty,fine,too,said,belle,shy,pride,in,her,voice,<END>
oh,he,was,wonderful,<END>
cried,melanie,warmly,<END>
the,yankees,couldn't,help,but,believe,his,testimony,<END>

i,can,never,thank,him,enough,or,you,either,<END>
how,good,and,kind,you,are,<END>

and,i'll,bet,they,ain't,grateful,to,captain,butler,neither,<END>
i'll,bet,they'll,hate,him,just,this,much,more,<END>
i'll,bet,you'll,be,the,only,lady,who,even,says,thanks,to,me,<END>
i'll,bet,they,won't,even,look,me,in,the,eye,when,they,see,me,on,the,street,<END>

scarlett,sat,in,her,bedroom,picking,at,the,supper,tray,mammy,had,brought,her,listening,to,the,wind,hurling,itself,out,of,the,night,<END>

and,she,knew,if,she,could,have,kept,from,having,ella,ella,would,never,have,been,born,<END>
she,shivered,frightened,wishing,frank,were,alive,so,she,could,be,nice,to,him,so,very,nice,to,him,to,make,up,for,it,all,<END>

oh,if,only,the,minutes,did,not,go,by,so,slowly,and,the,house,were,not,so,still,<END>

if,only,melanie,were,with,her,melanie,could,calm,her,fears,<END>

for,a,moment,scarlett,thought,of,summoning,pittypat,to,stand,between,her,and,her,conscience,but,she,hesitated,<END>

he,had,been,more,her,contemporary,than,scarlett's,and,she,had,been,devoted,to,him,<END>
he,had,filled,to,perfection,pitty's,need,for,a,man,in,the,house,for,he,brought,her,little,presents,and,harmless,gossip,jokes,and,stories,read,the,paper,to,her,at,night,and,explained,topics,of,the,day,to,her,while,she,mended,his,socks,<END>
she,had,fussed,over,him,and,planned,special,dishes,for,him,and,coddled,him,during,his,innumerable,colds,<END>
now,she,missed,him,acutely,and,repeated,over,and,over,as,she,dabbed,at,her,red,swollen,eyes,if,only,he,hadn't,gone,out,with,the,klan,<END>
if,there,were,only,someone,who,could,comfort,her,quiet,her,fears,explain,to,her,just,what,were,these,confused,fears,which,made,her,heart,sink,with,such,cold,sickness,<END>

she,had,almost,killed,ashley,just,as,she,had,killed,frank,<END>
and,if,ashley,ever,knew,the,real,truth,about,how,she,lied,to,frank,to,get,him,knew,how,mean,she,had,been,to,frank,he,could,never,love,her,any,more,<END>
ashley,was,so,honorable,so,truthful,so,kind,and,he,saw,so,straightly,so,clearly,<END>
if,he,knew,the,whole,truth,he,would,understand,<END>
oh,yes,he,would,understand,only,too,well,<END>
but,he,would,never,love,her,any,more,<END>
so,he,must,never,know,the,truth,because,he,must,keep,on,loving,her,<END>
how,could,she,live,if,that,secret,source,of,her,strength,his,love,were,taken,from,her,<END>
but,what,a,relief,it,would,be,to,put,her,head,on,his,shoulder,and,cry,and,unburden,her,guilty,heart,<END>
the,still,house,with,the,sense,of,death,heavy,upon,it,pressed,about,her,loneliness,until,she,felt,she,could,not,bear,it,unaided,any,longer,<END>
she,arose,cautiously,pushed,her,door,half-closed,and,then,dug,about,in,the,bottom,bureau,drawer,beneath,her,underwear,<END>
she,produced,aunt,pitty's,swoon,bottle,of,brandy,which,she,had,hidden,there,and,held,it,up,to,the,lamp,<END>
it,was,nearly,half-empty,<END>
surely,she,hadn't,drunk,that,much,since,last,night,<END>
she,poured,a,generous,amount,into,her,water,glass,and,gulped,it,down,<END>
she,would,have,to,put,the,bottle,back,in,the,cellaret,before,morning,filled,to,the,top,with,water,<END>
mammy,had,hunted,for,it,just,before,the,funeral,when,the,pallbearers,wanted,a,drink,and,already,the,air,in,the,kitchen,was,electric,with,suspicion,between,mammy,cookie,and,peter,<END>
the,brandy,burned,with,fiery,pleasantness,<END>
there,was,nothing,like,it,when,you,needed,it,<END>
in,fact,brandy,was,good,almost,any,time,so,much,better,than,insipid,wine,<END>
why,on,earth,should,it,be,proper,for,a,woman,to,drink,wine,and,not,spirits,<END>
mrs,merriwether,and,mrs,meade,had,sniffed,her,breath,most,obviously,at,the,funeral,and,she,had,seen,the,triumphant,look,they,had,exchanged,<END>
the,old,cats,<END>
she,poured,another,drink,<END>
it,wouldn't,matter,if,she,did,get,a,little,tipsy,tonight,for,she,was,going,to,bed,soon,and,she,could,gargle,cologne,before,mammy,came,up,to,unlace,her,<END>
she,wished,she,could,get,as,completely,and,thoughtlessly,drunk,as,gerald,used,to,get,on,court,day,<END>
then,perhaps,she,could,forget,frank's,sunken,face,accusing,her,of,ruining,his,life,and,then,killing,him,<END>
she,wondered,if,everyone,in,town,thought,she,had,killed,him,<END>
certainly,the,people,at,the,funeral,had,been,cold,to,her,<END>
the,only,people,who,had,put,any,warmth,into,their,expressions,of,sympathy,were,the,wives,of,the,yankee,officers,with,whom,she,did,business,<END>
well,she,didn't,care,what,the,town,said,about,her,<END>
how,unimportant,that,seemed,beside,what,she,would,have,to,answer,for,to,god,<END>
she,took,another,drink,at,the,thought,shuddering,as,the,hot,brandy,went,down,her,throat,<END>
she,felt,very,warm,now,but,still,she,couldn't,get,the,thought,of,frank,out,of,her,mind,<END>
what,fools,men,were,when,they,said,liquor,made,people,forget,<END>
unless,she,drank,herself,into,insensibility,she'd,still,see,frank's,face,as,it,had,looked,the,last,time,he,begged,her,not,to,drive,alone,timid,reproachful,apologetic,<END>
the,knocker,on,the,front,door,hammered,with,a,dull,sound,that,made,the,still,house,echo,and,she,heard,aunt,pitty's,waddling,steps,crossing,the,hall,and,the,door,opening,<END>
there,was,the,sound,of,greeting,and,an,indistinguishable,murmur,<END>
some,neighbor,calling,to,discuss,the,funeral,or,to,bring,a,blanc,mange,<END>
pitty,would,like,that,<END>
she,had,taken,an,important,and,melancholy,pleasure,in,talking,to,the,condolence,callers,<END>
she,wondered,incuriously,who,it,was,and,when,a,man's,voice,resonant,and,drawling,rose,above,pitty's,funereal,whispering,she,knew,<END>
gladness,and,relief,flooded,her,<END>
it,was,rhett,<END>
she,had,not,seen,him,since,he,broke,the,news,of,frank's,death,to,her,and,now,she,knew,deep,in,her,heart,that,he,was,the,one,person,who,could,help,her,tonight,<END>
i,think,she'll,see,me,rhett's,voice,floated,up,to,her,<END>
but,she,is,lying,down,now,captain,butler,and,won't,see,anyone,<END>
poor,child,she,is,quite,prostrated,<END>
she,<END>
i,think,she,will,see,me,<END>
please,tell,her,i,am,going,away,tomorrow,and,may,be,gone,some,time,<END>
it's,very,important,<END>
but,fluttered,aunt,pittypat,<END>
scarlett,ran,out,into,the,hall,observing,with,some,astonishment,that,her,knees,were,a,little,unsteady,and,leaned,over,the,banisters,<END>
i'll,be,down,terrectly,rhett,she,called,<END>
she,had,a,glimpse,of,aunt,pittypat's,plump,upturned,face,her,eyes,owlish,with,surprise,and,disapproval,<END>
now,it'll,be,all,over,town,that,i,conducted,myself,most,improperly,on,the,day,of,my,husband's,funeral,thought,scarlett,as,she,hurried,back,to,her,room,and,began,smoothing,her,hair,<END>
she,buttoned,her,black,basque,up,to,the,chin,and,pinned,down,the,collar,with,pittypat's,mourning,brooch,<END>
i,don't,look,very,pretty,she,thought,leaning,toward,the,mirror,too,white,and,scared,<END>
for,a,moment,her,hand,went,toward,the,lock,box,where,she,kept,her,rouge,hidden,but,she,decided,against,it,<END>
poor,pittypat,would,be,upset,in,earnest,if,she,came,downstairs,pink,and,blooming,<END>
she,picked,up,the,cologne,bottle,and,took,a,large,mouthful,carefully,rinsed,her,mouth,and,then,spit,into,the,slop,jar,<END>
she,rustled,down,the,stairs,toward,the,two,who,still,stood,in,the,hall,for,pittypat,had,been,too,upset,by,scarlett's,action,to,ask,rhett,to,sit,down,<END>
he,was,decorously,clad,in,black,his,linen,frilly,and,starched,and,his,manner,was,all,that,custom,demanded,from,an,old,friend,paying,a,call,of,sympathy,on,one,bereaved,<END>
in,fact,it,was,so,perfect,that,it,verged,on,the,burlesque,though,pittypat,did,not,see,it,<END>
he,was,properly,apologetic,for,disturbing,scarlett,and,regretted,that,in,his,rush,of,closing,up,business,before,leaving,town,he,had,been,unable,to,be,present,at,the,funeral,<END>
whatever,possessed,him,to,come,<END>
wondered,scarlett,<END>
he,doesn't,mean,a,word,he's,saying,<END>
i,hate,to,intrude,on,you,at,this,time,but,i,have,a,matter,of,business,to,discuss,that,will,not,wait,<END>
something,that,mr,kennedy,and,i,were,planning,<END>
i,didn't,know,you,and,mr,kennedy,had,business,dealings,said,aunt,pittypat,almost,indignant,that,some,of,frank's,activities,were,unknown,to,her,<END>
mr,kennedy,was,a,man,of,wide,interests,said,rhett,respectfully,<END>
shall,we,go,into,the,parlor,<END>
no,<END>
cried,scarlett,glancing,at,the,closed,folding,doors,<END>
she,could,still,see,the,coffin,in,that,room,<END>
she,hoped,she,never,had,to,enter,it,again,<END>
pitty,for,once,took,a,hint,although,with,none,too,good,grace,<END>
do,use,the,library,<END>
i,must,i,must,go,upstairs,and,get,out,the,mending,<END>
dear,me,i've,neglected,it,so,this,last,week,<END>
i,declare,<END>
she,went,up,the,stairs,with,a,backward,look,of,reproach,which,was,noticed,by,neither,scarlett,nor,rhett,<END>
he,stood,aside,to,let,her,pass,before,him,into,the,library,<END>
what,business,did,you,and,frank,have,<END>
she,questioned,abruptly,<END>
he,came,closer,and,whispered,<END>
none,at,all,<END>
i,just,wanted,to,get,miss,pitty,out,of,the,way,<END>
he,paused,as,he,leaned,over,her,<END>
it's,no,good,scarlett,<END>
what,<END>
the,cologne,<END>
i'm,sure,i,don't,know,what,you,mean,<END>
i'm,sure,you,do,<END>
you've,been,drinking,pretty,heavily,<END>
well,what,if,i,have,<END>
is,it,any,of,your,business,<END>
the,soul,of,courtesy,even,in,the,depths,of,sorrow,<END>
don't,drink,alone,scarlett,<END>
people,always,find,it,out,and,it,ruins,the,reputation,<END>
and,besides,it's,a,bad,business,this,drinking,alone,<END>
what's,the,matter,honey,<END>
he,led,her,to,the,rosewood,sofa,and,she,sat,down,in,silence,<END>
may,i,close,the,doors,<END>
she,knew,if,mammy,saw,the,closed,doors,she,would,be,scandalized,and,would,lecture,and,grumble,about,it,for,days,but,it,would,be,still,worse,if,mammy,should,overhear,this,discussion,of,drinking,especially,in,light,of,the,missing,brandy,bottle,<END>
she,nodded,and,rhett,drew,the,sliding,doors,together,<END>
when,he,came,back,and,sat,down,beside,her,his,dark,eyes,alertly,searching,her,face,the,pall,of,death,receded,before,the,vitality,he,radiated,and,the,room,seemed,pleasant,and,homelike,again,the,lamps,rosy,and,warm,<END>
what's,the,matter,honey,<END>
no,one,in,the,world,could,say,that,foolish,word,of,endearment,as,caressingly,as,rhett,even,when,he,was,joking,but,he,did,not,look,as,if,he,were,joking,now,<END>
she,raised,tormented,eyes,to,his,face,and,somehow,found,comfort,in,the,blank,inscrutability,she,saw,there,<END>
she,did,not,know,why,this,should,be,for,he,was,such,an,unpredictable,callous,person,<END>
perhaps,it,was,because,as,he,often,said,they,were,so,much,alike,<END>
sometimes,she,thought,that,all,the,people,she,had,ever,known,were,strangers,except,rhett,<END>
can't,you,tell,me,<END>
he,took,her,hand,oddly,gentle,<END>
it's,more,than,old,frank,leaving,you,<END>
do,you,need,money,<END>
money,<END>
god,no,<END>
oh,rhett,i'm,so,afraid,<END>
don't,be,a,goose,scarlett,you've,never,been,afraid,in,your,life,<END>
oh,rhett,i,am,afraid,<END>
the,words,bubbled,up,faster,than,she,could,speak,them,<END>
she,could,tell,him,<END>
she,could,tell,rhett,anything,<END>
he'd,been,so,bad,himself,that,he,wouldn't,sit,in,judgment,on,her,<END>
how,wonderful,to,know,someone,who,was,bad,and,dishonorable,and,a,cheat,and,a,liar,when,all,the,world,was,filled,with,people,who,would,not,lie,to,save,their,souls,and,who,would,rather,starve,than,do,a,dishonorable,deed,<END>
i'm,afraid,i'll,die,and,go,to,hell,<END>
if,he,laughed,at,her,she,would,die,right,then,<END>
but,he,did,not,laugh,<END>
you,are,pretty,healthy,and,maybe,there,isn't,any,hell,after,all,<END>
oh,but,there,is,rhett,<END>
you,know,there,is,<END>
i,know,there,is,but,it's,right,here,on,earth,<END>
not,after,we,die,<END>
there's,nothing,after,we,die,scarlett,<END>
you,are,having,your,hell,now,<END>
oh,rhett,that's,blasphemous,<END>
but,singularly,comforting,<END>
tell,me,why,are,you,going,to,hell,<END>
he,was,teasing,now,she,could,see,the,glint,in,his,eyes,but,she,did,not,mind,<END>
his,hands,felt,so,warm,and,strong,so,comforting,to,cling,to,<END>
rhett,i,oughtn't,to,have,married,frank,<END>
it,was,wrong,<END>
he,was,suellen's,beau,and,he,loved,her,not,me,<END>
but,i,lied,to,him,and,told,him,she,was,going,to,marry,tony,fontaine,<END>
oh,how,could,i,have,done,it,<END>
ah,so,that,was,how,it,came,about,<END>
i,always,wondered,<END>
and,then,i,made,him,so,miserable,<END>
i,made,him,do,all,sorts,of,things,he,didn't,want,to,do,like,making,people,pay,their,bills,when,they,really,couldn't,afford,to,pay,them,<END>
and,it,hurt,him,so,when,i,ran,the,mills,and,built,the,saloon,and,leased,convicts,<END>
he,could,hardly,hold,up,his,head,for,shame,<END>
and,rhett,i,killed,him,<END>
yes,i,did,<END>
i,didn't,know,he,was,in,the,klan,<END>
i,never,dreamed,he,had,that,much,gumption,<END>
but,i,ought,to,have,known,<END>
and,i,killed,him,<END>
'will,all,great,neptune's,ocean,wash,this,blood,clean,from,my,hand,',<END>
what,<END>
no,matter,<END>
go,on,<END>
go,on,<END>
that's,all,<END>
isn't,it,enough,<END>
i,married,him,i,made,him,unhappy,and,i,killed,him,<END>
oh,my,god,<END>
i,don't,see,how,i,could,have,done,it,<END>
i,lied,to,him,and,i,married,him,<END>
it,all,seemed,so,right,when,i,did,it,but,now,i,see,how,wrong,it,was,<END>
rhett,it,doesn't,seem,like,it,was,me,who,did,all,these,things,<END>
i,was,so,mean,to,him,but,i'm,not,really,mean,<END>
i,wasn't,raised,that,way,<END>
mother,she,stopped,and,swallowed,<END>
she,had,avoided,thinking,of,ellen,all,day,but,she,could,no,longer,blot,out,her,image,<END>
i,often,wondered,what,she,was,like,<END>
you,seemed,to,me,so,like,your,father,<END>
mother,was,oh,rhett,for,the,first,time,i'm,glad,she's,dead,so,she,can't,see,me,<END>
she,didn't,raise,me,to,be,mean,<END>
she,was,so,kind,to,everybody,so,good,<END>
she'd,rather,i'd,have,starved,than,done,this,<END>
and,i,so,wanted,to,be,just,like,her,in,every,way,and,i'm,not,like,her,one,bit,<END>
i,hadn't,thought,of,that,there's,been,so,much,else,to,think,about,but,i,wanted,to,be,like,her,<END>

rhett,sometimes,i,did,try,so,hard,to,be,nice,to,people,and,kind,to,frank,but,then,the,nightmare,would,come,back,and,scare,me,so,bad,i'd,want,to,rush,out,and,just,grab,money,away,from,people,whether,it,was,mine,or,not,<END>
tears,were,streaming,unheeded,down,her,face,and,she,clutched,his,hand,so,hard,that,her,nails,dug,into,his,flesh,<END>
what,nightmare,<END>
his,voice,was,calm,and,soothing,<END>
oh,i,forgot,you,didn't,know,<END>
well,just,when,i,would,try,to,be,nice,to,folks,and,tell,myself,that,money,wasn't,everything,i'd,go,to,bed,and,dream,that,i,was,back,at,tara,right,after,mother,died,right,after,the,yankees,went,through,<END>
rhett,you,can't,imagine,i,get,cold,when,i,think,about,it,<END>
i,can,see,how,everything,is,burned,and,so,still,and,there's,nothing,to,eat,<END>
oh,rhett,in,my,dream,i'm,hungry,again,<END>
go,on,<END>
i'm,hungry,and,everybody,pa,and,the,girls,and,the,darkies,are,starving,and,they,keep,saying,over,and,over,'we're,hungry',and,i'm,so,empty,it,hurts,and,so,frightened,<END>
my,mind,keeps,saying,'if,i,ever,get,out,of,this,i'll,never,never,be,hungry,again',and,then,the,dream,goes,off,into,a,gray,mist,and,i'm,running,running,in,the,mist,running,so,hard,my,heart's,about,to,burst,and,something,is,chasing,me,and,i,can't,breathe,but,i,keep,thinking,that,if,i,can,just,get,there,i'll,be,safe,<END>
but,i,don't,know,where,i'm,trying,to,get,to,<END>
and,then,i'd,wake,up,and,i'd,be,cold,with,fright,and,so,afraid,that,i'd,be,hungry,again,<END>
when,i,wake,up,from,that,dream,it,seems,like,there's,not,enough,money,in,the,world,to,keep,me,from,being,afraid,of,being,hungry,again,<END>
and,then,frank,would,be,so,mealy,mouthed,and,slow,poky,that,he,would,make,me,mad,and,i'd,lose,my,temper,<END>
he,didn't,understand,i,guess,and,i,couldn't,make,him,understand,<END>
i,kept,thinking,that,i'd,make,it,up,to,him,some,day,when,we,had,money,and,i,wasn't,so,afraid,of,being,hungry,<END>
and,now,he's,dead,and,it's,too,late,<END>
oh,it,seemed,so,right,when,i,did,it,but,it,was,all,so,wrong,<END>
if,i,had,it,to,do,over,again,i'd,do,it,so,differently,<END>
hush,he,said,disentangling,her,frantic,grip,and,pulling,a,clean,handkerchief,from,his,pocket,<END>
wipe,your,face,<END>
there,is,no,sense,in,your,tearing,yourself,to,pieces,this,way,<END>
she,took,the,handkerchief,and,wiped,her,damp,cheeks,a,little,relief,stealing,over,her,as,if,she,had,shifted,some,of,her,burden,to,his,broad,shoulders,<END>
he,looked,so,capable,and,calm,and,even,the,slight,twist,of,his,mouth,was,comforting,as,though,it,proved,her,agony,and,confusion,unwarranted,<END>
feel,better,now,<END>
then,let's,get,to,the,bottom,of,this,<END>
you,say,if,you,had,it,to,do,over,again,you'd,do,it,differently,<END>
but,would,you,<END>
think,now,<END>
would,you,<END>
well,<END>
no,you'd,do,the,same,things,again,<END>
did,you,have,any,other,choice,<END>
no,<END>
then,what,are,you,sorry,about,<END>
i,was,so,mean,and,now,he's,dead,<END>
and,if,he,wasn't,dead,you'd,still,be,mean,<END>
as,i,understand,it,you,are,not,really,sorry,for,marrying,frank,and,bullying,him,and,inadvertently,causing,his,death,<END>
you,are,only,sorry,because,you,are,afraid,of,going,to,hell,<END>
is,that,right,<END>
well,that,sounds,so,mixed,up,<END>
your,ethics,are,considerably,mixed,up,too,<END>
you,are,in,the,exact,position,of,a,thief,who's,been,caught,red,handed,and,isn't,sorry,he,stole,but,is,terribly,terribly,sorry,he's,going,to,jail,<END>
a,thief,<END>
oh,don't,be,so,literal,<END>
in,other,words,if,you,didn't,have,this,silly,idea,that,you,were,damned,to,hell,fire,eternal,you'd,think,you,were,well,rid,of,frank,<END>

oh,come,<END>
you,are,confessing,and,you,might,as,well,confess,the,truth,as,a,decorous,lie,<END>
did,your,er,conscience,bother,you,much,when,you,offered,to,shall,we,say,part,with,that,jewel,which,is,dearer,than,life,for,three,hundred,dollars,<END>
the,brandy,was,spinning,in,her,head,now,and,she,felt,giddy,and,a,little,reckless,<END>

he,always,seemed,to,read,her,mind,<END>
i,really,didn't,think,about,god,much,then,or,hell,<END>

but,you,believe,in,a,god,of,wrath,and,that's,what's,important,at,present,<END>
why,shouldn't,the,lord,understand,<END>
are,you,sorry,you,still,own,tara,and,there,aren't,carpetbaggers,living,there,<END>
are,you,sorry,you,aren't,hungry,and,ragged,<END>
oh,no,<END>
well,did,you,have,any,alternative,except,marrying,frank,<END>
no,<END>
he,didn't,have,to,marry,you,did,he,<END>
men,are,free,agents,<END>
and,he,didn't,have,to,let,you,bully,him,into,doing,things,he,didn't,want,to,did,he,<END>
well,<END>
scarlett,why,worry,about,it,<END>
if,you,had,it,to,do,over,again,you,would,be,driven,to,the,lie,and,he,to,marrying,you,<END>
you,would,still,have,run,yourself,into,danger,and,he,would,have,had,to,avenge,you,<END>
if,he,had,married,sister,sue,she,might,not,have,caused,his,death,but,she'd,probably,have,made,him,twice,as,unhappy,as,you,did,<END>
it,couldn't,have,happened,differently,<END>
but,i,could,have,been,nicer,to,him,<END>
you,could,have,been,if,you'd,been,somebody,else,<END>
but,you,were,born,to,bully,anyone,who'll,let,you,do,it,<END>
the,strong,were,made,to,bully,and,the,weak,to,knuckle,under,<END>
it's,all,frank's,fault,for,not,beating,you,with,a,buggy,whip,<END>
i'm,surprised,at,you,scarlett,for,sprouting,a,conscience,this,late,in,life,<END>
opportunists,like,you,shouldn't,have,them,<END>
what,is,an,oppor,what,did,you,call,it,<END>
a,person,who,takes,advantage,of,opportunities,<END>
is,that,wrong,<END>
it,has,always,been,held,in,disrepute,especially,by,those,who,had,the,same,opportunities,and,didn't,take,them,<END>
oh,rhett,you,are,joking,and,i,thought,you,were,going,to,be,nice,<END>
i,am,being,nice,for,me,<END>
scarlett,darling,you,are,tipsy,<END>
that's,what's,the,matter,with,you,<END>
you,dare,<END>
yes,i,dare,<END>
you,are,on,the,verge,of,what,is,vulgarly,called,a,'crying,jag',and,so,i,shall,change,the,subject,and,cheer,you,up,by,telling,you,some,news,that,will,amuse,you,<END>
in,fact,that's,why,i,came,here,this,evening,to,tell,you,my,news,before,i,went,away,<END>
where,are,you,going,<END>
to,england,and,i,may,be,gone,for,months,<END>
forget,your,conscience,scarlett,<END>
i,have,no,intention,of,discussing,your,soul's,welfare,any,further,<END>
don't,you,want,to,hear,my,news,<END>
but,she,began,feebly,and,paused,<END>
between,the,brandy,which,was,smoothing,out,the,harsh,contours,of,remorse,and,rhett's,mocking,but,comforting,words,the,pale,specter,of,frank,was,receding,into,shadows,<END>
perhaps,rhett,was,right,<END>
perhaps,god,did,understand,<END>
she,recovered,enough,to,push,the,idea,from,the,top,of,her,mind,and,decide,i'll,think,about,it,all,tomorrow,<END>
what's,your,news,<END>
she,said,with,an,effort,blowing,her,nose,on,his,handkerchief,and,pushing,back,the,hair,that,had,begun,to,straggle,<END>
my,news,is,this,he,answered,grinning,down,at,her,<END>
i,still,want,you,more,than,any,woman,i've,ever,seen,and,now,that,frank's,gone,i,thought,you'd,be,interested,to,know,it,<END>
scarlett,jerked,her,hands,away,from,his,grasp,and,sprang,to,her,feet,<END>
i,you,are,the,most,ill-bred,man,in,the,world,coming,here,at,this,time,of,all,times,with,your,filthy,i,should,have,known,you'd,never,change,<END>
and,frank,hardly,cold,<END>
if,you,had,any,decency,will,you,leave,this,<END>
do,be,quiet,or,you'll,have,miss,pittypat,down,here,in,a,minute,he,said,not,rising,but,reaching,up,and,taking,both,her,fists,<END>
i'm,afraid,you,miss,my,point,<END>
miss,your,point,<END>
i,don't,miss,anything,<END>
she,pulled,against,his,grip,<END>
turn,me,loose,and,get,out,of,here,<END>
i,never,heard,of,such,bad,taste,<END>
i,<END>
hush,he,said,<END>
i,am,asking,you,to,marry,me,<END>
would,you,be,convinced,if,i,knelt,down,<END>
she,said,oh,breathlessly,and,sat,down,hard,on,the,sofa,<END>
she,stared,at,him,her,mouth,open,wondering,if,the,brandy,were,playing,tricks,on,her,mind,remembering,senselessly,his,jibing,my,dear,i'm,not,a,marrying,man,<END>
she,was,drunk,or,he,was,crazy,<END>
but,he,did,not,look,crazy,<END>
he,looked,as,calm,as,though,he,were,discussing,the,weather,and,his,smooth,drawl,fell,on,her,ears,with,no,particular,emphasis,<END>
i,always,intended,having,you,scarlett,since,that,first,day,i,saw,you,at,twelve,oaks,when,you,threw,that,vase,and,swore,and,proved,that,you,weren't,a,lady,<END>
i,always,intended,having,you,one,way,or,another,<END>
but,as,you,and,frank,have,made,a,little,money,i,know,you'll,never,be,driven,to,me,again,with,any,interesting,propositions,of,loans,and,collaterals,<END>
so,i,see,i'll,have,to,marry,you,<END>
rhett,butler,is,this,one,of,your,vile,jokes,<END>
i,bare,my,soul,and,you,are,suspicious,<END>
no,scarlett,this,is,a,bona,fide,honorable,declaration,<END>
i,admit,that,it's,not,in,the,best,of,taste,coming,at,this,time,but,i,have,a,very,good,excuse,for,my,lack,of,breeding,<END>
i'm,going,away,tomorrow,for,a,long,time,and,i,fear,that,if,i,wait,till,i,return,you'll,have,married,some,one,else,with,a,little,money,<END>
so,i,thought,why,not,me,and,my,money,<END>
really,scarlett,i,can't,go,all,my,life,waiting,to,catch,you,between,husbands,<END>
he,meant,it,<END>
there,was,no,doubt,about,it,<END>
her,mouth,was,dry,as,she,assimilated,this,knowledge,and,she,swallowed,and,looked,into,his,eyes,trying,to,find,some,clue,<END>
they,were,full,of,laughter,but,there,was,something,else,deep,in,them,which,she,had,never,seen,before,a,gleam,that,defied,analysis,<END>
he,sat,easily,carelessly,but,she,felt,that,he,was,watching,her,as,alertly,as,a,cat,watches,a,mouse,hole,<END>
there,was,a,sense,of,leashed,power,straining,beneath,his,calm,that,made,her,draw,back,a,little,frightened,<END>
he,was,actually,asking,her,to,marry,him,he,was,committing,the,incredible,<END>
once,she,had,planned,how,she,would,torment,him,should,he,ever,propose,<END>
once,she,had,thought,that,if,he,ever,spoke,those,words,she,would,humble,him,and,make,him,feel,her,power,and,take,a,malicious,pleasure,in,doing,it,<END>
now,he,had,spoken,and,the,plans,did,not,even,occur,to,her,for,he,was,no,more,in,her,power,than,he,had,ever,been,<END>
in,fact,he,held,the,whip,hand,of,the,situation,so,completely,that,she,was,as,flustered,as,a,girl,at,her,first,proposal,and,she,could,only,blush,and,stammer,<END>
i,i,shall,never,marry,again,<END>
oh,yes,you,will,<END>
you,were,born,to,be,married,<END>
why,not,me,<END>
but,rhett,i,i,don't,love,you,<END>
that,should,be,no,drawback,<END>
i,don't,recall,that,love,was,prominent,in,your,other,two,ventures,<END>
oh,how,can,you,<END>
you,know,i,was,fond,of,frank,<END>
he,said,nothing,<END>
i,was,<END>
i,was,<END>
well,we,won't,argue,that,<END>
will,you,think,over,my,proposition,while,i'm,gone,<END>
rhett,i,don't,like,for,things,to,drag,on,<END>
i'd,rather,tell,you,now,<END>
i'm,going,home,to,tara,soon,and,india,wilkes,will,stay,with,aunt,pittypat,<END>
i,want,to,go,home,for,a,long,spell,and,i,i,don't,ever,want,to,get,married,again,<END>
nonsense,<END>
why,<END>
oh,well,never,mind,why,<END>
i,just,don't,like,being,married,<END>
but,my,poor,child,you've,never,really,been,married,<END>
how,can,you,know,<END>
i'll,admit,you've,had,bad,luck,once,for,spite,and,once,for,money,<END>
did,you,ever,think,of,marrying,just,for,the,fun,of,it,<END>
fun,<END>
don't,talk,like,a,fool,<END>
there's,no,fun,being,married,<END>
no,<END>
why,not,<END>
a,measure,of,calm,had,returned,and,with,it,all,the,natural,bluntness,which,brandy,brought,to,the,surface,<END>
it's,fun,for,men,though,god,knows,why,<END>
i,never,could,understand,it,<END>
but,all,a,woman,gets,out,of,it,is,something,to,eat,and,a,lot,of,work,and,having,to,put,up,with,a,man's,foolishness,and,a,baby,every,year,<END>
he,laughed,so,loudly,that,the,sound,echoed,in,the,stillness,and,scarlett,heard,the,kitchen,door,open,<END>
hush,<END>
mammy,has,ears,like,a,lynx,and,it,isn't,decent,to,laugh,so,soon,after,hush,laughing,<END>
you,know,it's,true,<END>
fun,<END>
fiddle-dee-,dee,<END>
i,said,you'd,had,bad,luck,and,what,you've,just,said,proves,it,<END>
you've,been,married,to,a,boy,and,to,an,old,man,<END>
and,into,the,bargain,i'll,bet,your,mother,told,you,that,women,must,bear,'these,things',because,of,the,compensating,joys,of,motherhood,<END>
well,that's,all,wrong,<END>
why,not,try,marrying,a,fine,young,man,who,has,a,bad,reputation,and,a,way,with,women,<END>
it'll,be,fun,<END>
you,are,coarse,and,conceited,and,i,think,this,conversation,has,gone,far,enough,<END>
it's,it's,quite,vulgar,<END>
and,quite,enjoyable,too,isn't,it,<END>
i'll,wager,you,never,discussed,the,marital,relation,with,a,man,before,even,charles,or,frank,<END>
she,scowled,at,him,<END>
rhett,knew,too,much,<END>
she,wondered,where,he,had,learned,all,he,knew,about,women,<END>
it,wasn't,decent,<END>
don't,frown,<END>
name,the,day,scarlett,<END>
i'm,not,urging,instant,matrimony,because,of,your,reputation,<END>
we'll,wait,the,decent,interval,<END>
by,the,way,just,how,long,is,a,'decent,interval',<END>
i,haven't,said,i'd,marry,you,<END>
it,isn't,decent,to,even,talk,of,such,things,at,such,a,time,<END>
i've,told,you,why,i'm,talking,of,them,<END>
i'm,going,away,tomorrow,and,i'm,too,ardent,a,lover,to,restrain,my,passion,any,longer,<END>
but,perhaps,i've,been,too,precipitate,in,my,wooing,<END>
with,a,suddenness,that,startled,her,he,slid,off,the,sofa,onto,his,knees,and,with,one,hand,placed,delicately,over,his,heart,he,recited,rapidly,<END>
forgive,me,for,startling,you,with,the,impetuosity,of,my,sentiments,my,dear,scarlett,i,mean,my,dear,mrs,kennedy,<END>
it,cannot,have,escaped,your,notice,that,for,some,time,past,the,friendship,i,have,had,in,my,heart,for,you,has,ripened,into,a,deeper,feeling,a,feeling,more,beautiful,more,pure,more,sacred,<END>
dare,i,name,it,you,<END>
ah,<END>
it,is,love,which,makes,me,so,bold,<END>
do,get,up,she,entreated,<END>
you,look,such,a,fool,and,suppose,mammy,should,come,in,and,see,you,<END>
she,would,be,stunned,and,incredulous,at,the,first,signs,of,my,gentility,said,rhett,arising,lightly,<END>
come,scarlett,you,are,no,child,no,schoolgirl,to,put,me,off,with,foolish,excuses,about,decency,and,so,forth,<END>
say,you'll,marry,me,when,i,come,back,or,before,god,i,won't,go,<END>
i'll,stay,around,here,and,play,a,guitar,under,your,window,every,night,and,sing,at,the,top,of,my,voice,and,compromise,you,so,you'll,have,to,marry,me,to,save,your,reputation,<END>
rhett,do,be,sensible,<END>
i,don't,want,to,marry,anybody,<END>
no,<END>
you,aren't,telling,me,the,real,reason,<END>
it,can't,be,girlish,timidity,<END>
what,is,it,<END>
suddenly,she,thought,of,ashley,saw,him,as,vividly,as,though,he,stood,beside,her,sunny,haired,drowsy,eyed,full,of,dignity,so,utterly,different,from,rhett,<END>
he,was,the,real,reason,she,did,not,want,to,marry,again,although,she,had,no,objections,to,rhett,and,at,times,was,genuinely,fond,of,him,<END>
she,belonged,to,ashley,forever,and,ever,<END>
she,had,never,belonged,to,charles,or,frank,could,never,really,belong,to,rhett,<END>
every,part,of,her,almost,everything,she,had,ever,done,striven,after,attained,belonged,to,ashley,were,done,because,she,loved,him,<END>
ashley,and,tara,she,belonged,to,them,<END>
the,smiles,the,laughter,the,kisses,she,had,given,charles,and,frank,were,ashley's,even,though,he,had,never,claimed,them,would,never,claim,them,<END>
somewhere,deep,in,her,was,the,desire,to,keep,herself,for,him,although,she,knew,he,would,never,take,her,<END>
she,did,not,know,that,her,face,had,changed,that,reverie,had,brought,a,softness,to,her,face,which,rhett,had,never,seen,before,<END>
he,looked,at,the,slanting,green,eyes,wide,and,misty,and,the,tender,curve,of,her,lips,and,for,a,moment,his,breath,stopped,<END>
then,his,mouth,went,down,violently,at,one,corner,and,he,swore,with,passionate,impatience,<END>
scarlett,o'hara,you're,a,fool,<END>
before,she,could,withdraw,her,mind,from,its,far,places,his,arms,were,around,her,as,sure,and,hard,as,on,the,dark,road,to,tara,so,long,ago,<END>
she,felt,again,the,rush,of,helplessness,the,sinking,yielding,the,surging,tide,of,warmth,that,left,her,limp,<END>
and,the,quiet,face,of,ashley,wilkes,was,blurred,and,drowned,to,nothingness,<END>
he,bent,back,her,head,across,his,arm,and,kissed,her,softly,at,first,and,then,with,a,swift,gradation,of,intensity,that,made,her,cling,to,him,as,the,only,solid,thing,in,a,dizzy,swaying,world,<END>
his,insistent,mouth,was,parting,her,shaking,lips,sending,wild,tremors,along,her,nerves,evoking,from,her,sensations,she,had,never,known,she,was,capable,of,feeling,<END>
and,before,a,swimming,giddiness,spun,her,round,and,round,she,knew,that,she,was,kissing,him,back,<END>
stop,please,i'm,faint,<END>
she,whispered,trying,to,turn,her,head,weakly,from,him,<END>
he,pressed,her,head,back,hard,against,his,shoulder,and,she,had,a,dizzy,glimpse,of,his,face,<END>
his,eyes,were,wide,and,blazing,queerly,and,the,tremor,in,his,arms,frightened,her,<END>
i,want,to,make,you,faint,<END>
i,will,make,you,faint,<END>
you've,had,this,coming,to,you,for,years,<END>
none,of,the,fools,you've,known,have,kissed,you,like,this,have,they,<END>
your,precious,charles,or,frank,or,your,stupid,ashley,<END>
please,<END>
i,said,your,stupid,ashley,<END>
gentlemen,all,what,do,they,know,about,women,<END>
what,did,they,know,about,you,<END>
i,know,you,<END>
his,mouth,was,on,hers,again,and,she,surrendered,without,a,struggle,too,weak,even,to,turn,her,head,without,even,the,desire,to,turn,it,her,heart,shaking,her,with,its,poundings,fear,of,his,strength,and,her,nerveless,weakness,sweeping,her,<END>
what,was,he,going,to,do,<END>
she,would,faint,if,he,did,not,stop,<END>
if,he,would,only,stop,if,he,would,never,stop,<END>
say,yes,<END>
his,mouth,was,poised,above,hers,and,his,eyes,were,so,close,that,they,seemed,enormous,filling,the,world,<END>
say,yes,damn,you,or,<END>
she,whispered,yes,before,she,even,thought,<END>
it,was,almost,as,if,he,had,willed,the,word,and,she,had,spoken,it,without,her,own,volition,<END>
but,even,as,she,spoke,it,a,sudden,calm,fell,on,her,spirit,her,head,began,to,stop,spinning,and,even,the,giddiness,of,the,brandy,was,lessened,<END>
she,had,promised,to,marry,him,when,she,had,had,no,intention,of,promising,<END>
she,hardly,knew,how,it,had,all,come,about,but,she,was,not,sorry,<END>
it,now,seemed,very,natural,that,she,had,said,yes,almost,as,if,by,divine,intervention,a,hand,stronger,than,hers,was,about,her,affairs,settling,her,problems,for,her,<END>
he,drew,a,quick,breath,as,she,spoke,and,bent,as,if,to,kiss,her,again,and,her,eyes,closed,and,her,head,fell,back,<END>
but,he,drew,back,and,she,was,faintly,disappointed,<END>
it,made,her,feel,so,strange,to,be,kissed,like,this,and,yet,there,was,something,exciting,about,it,<END>
he,sat,very,still,for,a,while,holding,her,head,against,his,shoulder,and,as,if,by,effort,the,trembling,of,his,arms,ceased,<END>
he,moved,away,from,her,a,little,and,looked,down,at,her,<END>
she,opened,her,eyes,and,saw,that,the,frightening,glow,had,gone,from,his,face,<END>
but,somehow,she,could,not,meet,his,gaze,and,she,dropped,her,eyes,in,a,rush,of,tingling,confusion,<END>
when,he,spoke,his,voice,was,very,calm,<END>
you,meant,it,<END>
you,don't,want,to,take,it,back,<END>
no,<END>
it's,not,just,because,i've,what,is,the,phrase,'swept,you,off,your,feet',by,my,er,ardor,<END>
she,could,not,answer,for,she,did,not,know,what,to,say,nor,could,she,meet,his,eyes,<END>
he,put,a,hand,under,her,chin,and,lifted,her,face,<END>
i,told,you,once,that,i,could,stand,anything,from,you,except,a,lie,<END>
and,now,i,want,the,truth,<END>
just,why,did,you,say,yes,<END>
still,the,words,would,not,come,but,a,measure,of,poise,returning,she,kept,her,eyes,demurely,down,and,tucked,the,corners,of,her,mouth,into,a,little,smile,<END>
look,at,me,<END>
is,it,my,money,<END>
why,rhett,<END>
what,a,question,<END>
look,up,and,don't,try,to,sweet,talk,me,<END>
i'm,not,charles,or,frank,or,any,of,the,county,boys,to,be,taken,in,by,your,fluttering,lids,<END>
is,it,my,money,<END>
well,yes,a,part,<END>
a,part,<END>
he,did,not,seem,annoyed,<END>
he,drew,a,swift,breath,and,with,an,effort,wiped,from,his,eyes,the,eagerness,her,words,had,brought,an,eagerness,which,she,was,too,confused,to,see,<END>
well,she,floundered,helplessly,money,does,help,you,know,rhett,and,god,knows,frank,didn't,leave,any,too,much,<END>
but,then,well,rhett,we,do,get,on,you,know,<END>
and,you,are,the,only,man,i,ever,saw,who,could,stand,the,truth,from,a,woman,and,it,would,be,nice,having,a,husband,who,didn't,think,me,a,silly,fool,and,expect,me,to,tell,lies,and,well,i,am,fond,of,you,<END>
fond,of,me,<END>
well,she,said,fretfully,if,i,said,i,was,madly,in,love,with,you,i'd,be,lying,and,what's,more,you'd,know,it,<END>
sometimes,i,think,you,carry,your,truth,telling,too,far,my,pet,<END>
don't,you,think,even,if,it,was,a,lie,that,it,would,be,appropriate,for,you,to,say,'i,love,you,rhett,',even,if,you,didn't,mean,it,<END>
what,was,he,driving,at,she,wondered,becoming,more,confused,<END>
he,looked,so,queer,eager,hurt,mocking,<END>
he,took,his,hands,from,her,and,shoved,them,deep,in,his,trousers,pockets,and,she,saw,him,ball,his,fists,<END>
if,it,costs,me,a,husband,i'll,tell,the,truth,she,thought,grimly,her,blood,up,as,always,when,he,baited,her,<END>
rhett,it,would,be,a,lie,and,why,should,we,go,through,all,that,foolishness,<END>
i'm,fond,of,you,like,i,said,<END>
you,know,how,it,is,<END>
you,told,me,once,that,you,didn't,love,me,but,that,we,had,a,lot,in,common,<END>
both,rascals,was,the,way,you,<END>
oh,god,<END>
he,whispered,rapidly,turning,his,head,away,<END>
to,be,taken,in,my,own,trap,<END>
what,did,you,say,<END>
nothing,and,he,looked,at,her,and,laughed,but,it,was,not,a,pleasant,laugh,<END>
name,the,day,my,dear,and,he,laughed,again,and,bent,and,kissed,her,hands,<END>
she,was,relieved,to,see,his,mood,pass,and,good,humor,apparently,return,so,she,smiled,too,<END>
he,played,with,her,hand,for,a,moment,and,grinned,up,at,her,<END>

you'd,break,his,heart,my,darling,cruel,destructive,little,cat,who,is,so,careless,and,confident,she,doesn't,even,trouble,to,sheathe,her,claws,<END>
he,jerked,her,to,her,feet,and,kissed,her,again,but,this,time,his,lips,were,different,for,he,seemed,not,to,care,if,he,hurt,her,seemed,to,want,to,hurt,her,to,insult,her,<END>
his,lips,slid,down,to,her,throat,and,finally,he,pressed,them,against,the,taffeta,over,her,breast,so,hard,and,so,long,that,his,breath,burnt,to,her,skin,<END>
her,hands,struggled,up,pushing,him,away,in,outraged,modesty,<END>

a,ring,<END>
what,kind,would,you,like,<END>
she,wavered,momentarily,between,interest,in,his,last,words,and,a,feminine,desire,to,prolong,the,scene,with,anger,and,indignation,<END>
oh,a,diamond,ring,and,rhett,do,buy,a,great,big,one,<END>
so,you,can,flaunt,it,before,your,poverty-stricken,friends,and,say,'see,what,i,caught,',<END>
very,well,you,shall,have,a,big,one,one,so,big,that,your,less-fortunate,friends,can,comfort,themselves,by,whispering,that,it's,really,vulgar,to,wear,such,large,stones,<END>
he,abruptly,started,off,across,the,room,and,she,followed,him,bewildered,to,the,closed,doors,<END>
what,is,the,matter,<END>

to,my,rooms,to,finish,packing,<END>
oh,but,<END>

nothing,<END>

he,opened,the,door,and,walked,into,the,hall,<END>
scarlett,trailed,after,him,somewhat,at,a,loss,a,trifle,disappointed,as,at,an,unexpected,anticlimax,<END>
he,slipped,on,his,coat,and,picked,up,his,gloves,and,hat,<END>
i'll,write,you,<END>

aren't,you,<END>

he,seemed,impatient,to,be,off,<END>

she,whispered,mindful,of,the,ears,of,the,house,<END>
don't,you,think,you've,had,enough,kissing,for,one,evening,<END>
he,retorted,and,grinned,down,at,her,<END>
to,think,of,a,modest,well-,brought-up,young,woman,well,i,told,you,it,would,be,fun,didn't,i,<END>
oh,you,are,impossible,<END>
she,cried,in,wrath,not,caring,if,mammy,did,hear,<END>
and,i,don't,care,if,you,never,come,back,<END>
she,turned,and,flounced,toward,the,stairs,expecting,to,feel,his,warm,hand,on,her,arm,stopping,her,<END>
but,he,only,pulled,open,the,front,door,and,a,cold,draft,swept,in,<END>
but,i,will,come,back,he,said,and,went,out,leaving,her,on,the,bottom,step,looking,at,the,closed,door,<END>
the,ring,rhett,brought,back,from,england,was,large,indeed,so,large,it,embarrassed,scarlett,to,wear,it,<END>
she,loved,gaudy,and,expensive,jewelry,but,she,had,an,uneasy,feeling,that,everyone,was,saying,with,perfect,truth,that,this,ring,was,vulgar,<END>
the,central,stone,was,a,four-carat,diamond,and,surrounding,it,were,a,number,of,emeralds,<END>
it,reached,to,the,knuckle,of,her,finger,and,gave,her,hand,the,appearance,of,being,weighted,down,<END>
scarlett,had,a,suspicion,that,rhett,had,gone,to,great,pains,to,have,the,ring,made,up,and,for,pure,meanness,had,ordered,it,made,as,ostentatious,as,possible,<END>
until,rhett,was,back,in,atlanta,and,the,ring,on,her,finger,she,told,no,one,not,even,her,family,of,her,intentions,and,when,she,did,announce,her,engagement,a,storm,of,bitter,gossip,broke,out,<END>
since,the,klan,affair,rhett,and,scarlett,had,been,with,the,exception,of,the,yankees,and,carpetbaggers,the,town's,most,unpopular,citizens,<END>
everyone,had,disapproved,of,scarlett,since,the,far-away,day,when,she,abandoned,the,weeds,worn,for,charlie,hamilton,<END>
their,disapproval,had,grown,stronger,because,of,her,unwomanly,conduct,in,the,matter,of,the,mills,her,immodesty,in,showing,herself,when,she,was,pregnant,and,so,many,other,things,<END>
but,when,she,brought,about,the,death,of,frank,and,tommy,and,jeopardized,the,lives,of,a,dozen,other,men,their,dislike,flamed,into,public,condemnation,<END>
as,for,rhett,he,had,enjoyed,the,town's,hatred,since,his,speculations,during,the,war,and,he,had,not,further,endeared,himself,to,his,fellow,citizens,by,his,alliances,with,the,republicans,since,then,<END>
but,oddly,enough,the,fact,that,he,had,saved,the,lives,of,some,of,atlanta's,most,prominent,men,was,what,aroused,the,hottest,hate,of,atlanta's,ladies,<END>
it,was,not,that,they,regretted,their,men,were,still,alive,<END>
it,was,that,they,bitterly,resented,owing,the,men's,lives,to,such,a,man,as,rhett,and,to,such,an,embarrassing,trick,<END>
for,months,they,had,writhed,under,yankee,laughter,and,scorn,and,the,ladies,felt,and,said,that,if,rhett,really,had,the,good,of,the,klan,at,heart,he,would,have,managed,the,affair,in,a,more,seemly,fashion,<END>
they,said,he,had,deliberately,dragged,in,belle,watling,to,put,the,nice,people,of,the,town,in,a,disgraceful,position,<END>
and,so,he,deserved,neither,thanks,for,rescuing,the,men,nor,forgiveness,for,his,past,sins,<END>
these,women,so,swift,to,kindness,so,tender,to,the,sorrowing,so,untiring,in,times,of,stress,could,be,as,implacable,as,furies,to,any,renegade,who,broke,one,small,law,of,their,unwritten,code,<END>
this,code,was,simple,<END>
reverence,for,the,confederacy,honor,to,the,veterans,loyalty,to,old,forms,pride,in,poverty,open,hands,to,friends,and,undying,hatred,to,yankees,<END>
between,them,scarlett,and,rhett,had,outraged,every,tenet,of,this,code,<END>
the,men,whose,lives,rhett,had,saved,attempted,out,of,decency,and,a,sense,of,gratitude,to,keep,their,women,silent,but,they,had,little,success,<END>
before,the,announcement,of,their,coming,marriage,the,two,had,been,unpopular,enough,but,people,could,still,be,polite,to,them,in,a,formal,way,<END>
now,even,that,cold,courtesy,was,no,longer,possible,<END>
the,news,of,their,engagement,came,like,an,explosion,unexpected,and,shattering,rocking,the,town,and,even,the,mildest-,mannered,women,spoke,their,minds,heatedly,<END>
marrying,barely,a,year,after,frank's,death,and,she,had,killed,him,<END>
and,marrying,that,butler,man,who,owned,a,brothel,and,who,was,in,with,the,yankees,and,carpetbaggers,in,all,kinds,of,thieving,schemes,<END>
separately,the,two,of,them,could,be,endured,but,the,brazen,combination,of,scarlett,and,rhett,was,too,much,to,be,borne,<END>
common,and,vile,both,of,them,<END>
they,ought,to,be,run,out,of,town,<END>
atlanta,might,perhaps,have,been,more,tolerant,toward,the,two,if,the,news,of,their,engagement,had,not,come,at,a,time,when,rhett's,carpetbagger,and,scallawag,cronies,were,more,odious,in,the,sight,of,respectable,citizens,than,they,had,ever,been,before,<END>
public,feeling,against,the,yankees,and,all,their,allies,was,at,fever,heat,at,the,very,time,when,the,town,learned,of,the,engagement,for,the,last,citadel,of,georgia's,resistance,to,yankee,rule,had,just,fallen,<END>
the,long,campaign,which,had,begun,when,sherman,moved,southward,from,above,dalton,four,years,before,had,finally,reached,its,climax,and,the,state's,humiliation,was,complete,<END>
three,years,of,reconstruction,had,passed,and,they,had,been,three,years,of,terrorism,<END>
everyone,had,thought,that,conditions,were,already,as,bad,as,they,could,ever,be,<END>
but,now,georgia,was,discovering,that,reconstruction,at,its,worst,had,just,begun,<END>
for,three,years,the,federal,government,had,been,trying,to,impose,alien,ideas,and,an,alien,rule,upon,georgia,and,with,an,army,to,enforce,its,commands,it,had,largely,succeeded,<END>
but,only,the,power,of,the,military,upheld,the,new,regime,<END>
the,state,was,under,the,yankee,rule,but,not,by,the,state's,consent,<END>
georgia's,leaders,had,kept,on,battling,for,the,state's,right,to,govern,itself,according,to,its,own,ideas,<END>
they,had,continued,resisting,all,efforts,to,force,them,to,bow,down,and,accept,the,dictates,of,washington,as,their,own,state,law,<END>
officially,georgia's,government,had,never,capitulated,but,it,had,been,a,futile,fight,an,ever-losing,fight,<END>
it,was,a,fight,that,could,not,win,but,it,had,at,least,postponed,the,inevitable,<END>
already,many,other,southern,states,had,illiterate,negroes,in,high,public,office,and,legislatures,dominated,by,negroes,and,carpetbaggers,<END>
but,georgia,by,its,stubborn,resistance,had,so,far,escaped,this,final,degradation,<END>
for,the,greater,part,of,three,years,the,state's,capitol,had,remained,in,the,control,of,white,men,and,democrats,<END>
with,yankee,soldiers,everywhere,the,state,officials,could,do,little,but,protest,and,resist,<END>
their,power,was,nominal,but,they,had,at,least,been,able,to,keep,the,state,government,in,the,hands,of,native,georgians,<END>
now,even,that,last,stronghold,had,fallen,<END>
just,as,johnston,and,his,men,had,been,driven,back,step,by,step,from,dalton,to,atlanta,four,years,before,so,had,the,georgia,democrats,been,driven,back,little,by,little,from,1865,on,<END>
the,power,of,the,federal,government,over,the,state's,affairs,and,the,lives,of,its,citizens,had,been,steadily,made,greater,and,greater,<END>
force,had,been,piled,on,top,of,force,and,military,edicts,in,increasing,numbers,had,rendered,the,civil,authority,more,and,more,impotent,<END>
finally,with,georgia,in,the,status,of,a,military,province,the,polls,had,been,ordered,thrown,open,to,the,negroes,whether,the,state's,laws,permitted,it,or,not,<END>
a,week,before,scarlett,and,rhett,announced,their,engagement,an,election,for,governor,had,been,held,<END>
the,southern,democrats,had,general,john,b,gordon,one,of,georgia's,best,loved,and,most,honored,citizens,as,their,candidate,<END>
opposing,him,was,a,republican,named,bullock,<END>
the,election,had,lasted,three,days,instead,of,one,<END>
trainloads,of,negroes,had,been,rushed,from,town,to,town,voting,at,every,precinct,along,the,way,<END>
of,course,bullock,had,won,<END>
if,the,capture,of,georgia,by,sherman,had,caused,bitterness,the,final,capture,of,the,state's,capitol,by,the,carpetbaggers,yankees,and,negroes,caused,an,intensity,of,bitterness,such,as,the,state,had,never,known,before,<END>
atlanta,and,georgia,seethed,and,raged,<END>
and,rhett,butler,was,a,friend,of,the,hated,bullock,<END>
scarlett,with,her,usual,disregard,of,all,matters,not,directly,under,her,nose,had,scarcely,known,an,election,was,being,held,<END>
rhett,had,taken,no,part,in,the,election,and,his,relations,with,the,yankees,were,no,different,from,what,they,had,always,been,<END>
but,the,fact,remained,that,rhett,was,a,scallawag,and,a,friend,of,bullock,<END>
and,if,the,marriage,went,through,scarlett,also,would,be,turning,scallawag,<END>
atlanta,was,in,no,mood,to,be,tolerant,or,charitable,toward,anyone,in,the,enemy,camp,and,the,news,of,the,engagement,coming,when,it,did,the,town,remembered,all,of,the,evil,things,about,the,pair,and,none,of,the,good,<END>
scarlett,knew,the,town,was,rocking,but,she,did,not,realize,the,extent,of,public,feeling,until,mrs,merriwether,urged,on,by,her,church,circle,took,it,upon,herself,to,speak,to,her,for,her,own,good,<END>
because,your,own,dear,mother,is,dead,and,miss,pitty,not,being,a,matron,is,not,qualified,to,er,well,to,talk,to,you,upon,such,a,subject,i,feel,that,i,must,warn,you,scarlett,captain,butler,is,not,the,kind,of,a,man,for,any,woman,of,good,family,to,marry,<END>

mammy's,a,smart,old,soul,and,one,of,the,few,people,i,know,whose,respect,and,good,will,i'd,like,to,have,<END>
but,being,a,mule,i,suppose,i'll,never,get,either,from,her,<END>
she,even,refused,the,ten-,dollar,gold,piece,which,i,in,my,groomlike,fervor,wished,to,present,her,after,the,wedding,<END>
i've,seen,so,few,people,who,did,not,melt,at,the,sight,of,cash,<END>
but,she,looked,me,in,the,eye,and,thanked,me,and,said,she,wasn't,a,free,issue,nigger,and,didn't,need,my,money,<END>
why,should,she,take,on,so,<END>
why,should,everybody,gabble,about,me,like,a,bunch,of,guinea,hens,<END>
it's,my,own,affair,whom,i,marry,and,how,often,i,marry,<END>
i've,always,minded,my,own,business,<END>
why,don't,other,people,mind,theirs,<END>
my,pet,the,world,can,forgive,practically,anything,except,people,who,mind,their,own,business,<END>
but,why,should,you,squall,like,a,scalded,cat,<END>
you've,said,often,enough,that,you,didn't,mind,what,people,said,about,you,<END>
why,not,prove,it,<END>
you,know,you've,laid,yourself,open,to,criticism,so,often,in,small,matters,you,can't,expect,to,escape,gossip,in,this,large,matter,<END>
you,knew,there'd,be,talk,if,you,married,a,villain,like,me,<END>
if,i,were,a,low-bred,poverty-stricken,villain,people,wouldn't,be,so,mad,<END>
but,a,rich,flourishing,villain,of,course,that's,unforgivable,<END>
i,wish,you'd,be,serious,sometimes,<END>
i,am,serious,<END>
it's,always,annoying,to,the,godly,when,the,ungodly,flourish,like,the,green,bay,tree,<END>
cheer,up,scarlett,didn't,you,tell,me,once,that,the,main,reason,you,wanted,a,lot,of,money,was,so,you,could,tell,everybody,to,go,to,hell,<END>
now's,your,chance,<END>
but,you,were,the,main,one,i,wanted,to,tell,to,go,to,hell,said,scarlett,and,laughed,<END>
do,you,still,want,to,tell,me,to,go,to,hell,<END>
well,not,as,often,as,i,used,to,<END>
do,it,whenever,you,like,if,it,makes,you,happy,<END>
it,doesn't,make,me,especially,happy,said,scarlett,and,bending,she,kissed,him,carelessly,<END>
his,dark,eyes,flickered,quickly,over,her,face,hunting,for,something,in,her,eyes,which,he,did,not,find,and,he,laughed,shortly,<END>
forget,about,atlanta,<END>
forget,about,the,old,cats,<END>
i,brought,you,to,new,orleans,to,have,fun,and,i,intend,that,you,shall,have,it,<END>
part,five,<END>
chapter,xlviii,<END>
she,did,have,fun,more,fun,than,she,had,had,since,the,spring,before,the,war,<END>
new,orleans,was,such,a,strange,glamorous,place,and,scarlett,enjoyed,it,with,the,headlong,pleasure,of,a,pardoned,life,prisoner,<END>
the,carpetbaggers,were,looting,the,town,many,honest,folk,were,driven,from,their,homes,and,did,not,know,where,to,look,for,their,next,meal,and,a,negro,sat,in,the,lieutenant,governor's,chair,<END>
but,the,new,orleans,rhett,showed,her,was,the,gayest,place,she,had,ever,seen,<END>
the,people,she,met,seemed,to,have,all,the,money,they,wanted,and,no,cares,at,all,<END>
rhett,introduced,her,to,dozens,of,women,pretty,women,in,bright,gowns,women,who,had,soft,hands,that,showed,no,signs,of,hard,work,women,who,laughed,at,everything,and,never,talked,of,stupid,serious,things,or,hard,times,<END>
and,the,men,she,met,how,thrilling,they,were,<END>
and,how,different,from,atlanta,men,and,how,they,fought,to,dance,with,her,and,paid,her,the,most,extravagant,compliments,as,though,she,were,a,young,belle,<END>
these,men,had,the,same,hard,reckless,look,rhett,wore,<END>
their,eyes,were,always,alert,like,men,who,have,lived,too,long,with,danger,to,be,ever,quite,careless,<END>
they,seemed,to,have,no,pasts,or,futures,and,they,politely,discouraged,scarlett,when,to,make,conversation,she,asked,what,or,where,they,were,before,they,came,to,new,orleans,<END>
that,in,itself,was,strange,for,in,atlanta,every,respectable,newcomer,hastened,to,present,his,credentials,to,tell,proudly,of,his,home,and,family,to,trace,the,tortuous,mazes,of,relationship,that,stretched,over,the,entire,south,<END>
but,these,men,were,a,taciturn,lot,picking,their,words,carefully,<END>
sometimes,when,rhett,was,alone,with,them,and,scarlett,in,the,next,room,she,heard,laughter,and,caught,fragments,of,conversation,that,meant,nothing,to,her,scraps,of,words,puzzling,names,cuba,and,nassau,in,the,blockade,days,the,gold,rush,and,claim,jumping,gun,running,and,filibustering,nicaragua,and,william,walker,and,how,he,died,against,a,wall,at,truxillo,<END>
once,her,sudden,entrance,abruptly,terminated,a,conversation,about,what,had,happened,to,the,members,of,quantrill's,band,of,guerillas,and,she,caught,the,names,of,frank,and,jesse,james,<END>
but,they,were,all,well,mannered,beautifully,tailored,and,they,evidently,admired,her,so,it,mattered,little,to,scarlett,that,they,chose,to,live,utterly,in,the,present,<END>
what,really,mattered,was,that,they,were,rhett's,friends,and,had,large,houses,and,fine,carriages,and,they,took,her,and,rhett,driving,invited,them,to,suppers,gave,parties,in,their,honor,<END>
and,scarlett,like,them,very,well,<END>
rhett,was,amused,when,she,told,him,so,<END>
i,thought,you,would,he,said,and,laughed,<END>
why,not,<END>
her,suspicions,aroused,as,always,by,his,laughter,<END>
they're,all,second-raters,black,sheep,rascals,<END>
they're,all,adventurers,or,carpetbag,aristocrats,<END>
they,all,made,their,money,speculating,in,food,like,your,loving,husband,or,out,of,dubious,government,contracts,or,in,shady,ways,that,won't,bear,investigation,<END>
i,don't,believe,it,<END>
you're,teasing,<END>
they're,the,nicest,people,<END>
the,nicest,people,in,town,are,starving,said,rhett,<END>
and,living,politely,in,hovels,and,i,doubt,if,i'd,be,received,in,those,hovels,<END>
you,see,my,dear,i,was,engaged,in,some,of,my,nefarious,schemes,here,during,the,war,and,these,people,have,devilish,long,memories,<END>
scarlett,you,are,a,constant,joy,to,me,<END>
you,unerringly,manage,to,pick,the,wrong,people,and,the,wrong,things,<END>
but,they,are,your,friends,<END>
oh,but,i,like,rascals,<END>
my,early,youth,was,spent,as,a,gambler,on,a,river,boat,and,i,can,understand,people,like,that,<END>
but,i'm,not,blind,to,what,they,are,<END>
whereas,you,he,laughed,again,you,have,no,instinct,about,people,no,discrimination,between,the,cheap,and,the,great,<END>
sometimes,i,think,that,the,only,great,ladies,you've,ever,associated,with,were,your,mother,and,miss,melly,and,neither,seems,to,have,made,any,impression,on,you,<END>
melly,<END>
why,she's,as,plain,as,an,old,shoe,and,her,clothes,always,look,tacky,and,she,never,has,two,words,to,say,for,herself,<END>
spare,me,your,jealousy,madam,<END>
beauty,doesn't,make,a,lady,nor,clothes,a,great,lady,<END>
oh,don't,they,<END>
just,you,wait,rhett,butler,and,i'll,show,you,<END>
now,that,i've,we've,got,money,i'm,going,to,be,the,greatest,lady,you,ever,saw,<END>
i,shall,wait,with,interest,he,said,<END>
more,exciting,than,the,people,she,met,were,the,frocks,rhett,bought,her,superintending,the,choice,of,colors,materials,and,designs,himself,<END>
hoops,were,out,now,and,the,new,styles,were,charming,with,the,skirts,pulled,back,from,the,front,and,draped,over,bustles,and,on,the,bustles,were,wreaths,of,flowers,and,bows,and,cascades,of,lace,<END>
she,thought,of,the,modest,hoops,of,the,war,years,and,she,felt,a,little,embarrassed,at,these,new,skirts,which,undeniably,outlined,her,abdomen,<END>
and,the,darling,little,bonnets,that,were,not,really,bonnets,at,all,but,flat,little,affairs,worn,over,one,eye,and,laden,with,fruits,and,flowers,dancing,plumes,and,fluttering,ribbons,<END>
if,only,rhett,had,not,been,so,silly,and,burned,the,false,curls,she,bought,to,augment,her,knot,of,indian-straight,hair,that,peeked,from,the,rear,of,these,little,hats,<END>
and,the,delicate,convent-made,underwear,<END>
how,lovely,it,was,and,how,many,sets,she,had,<END>
chemises,and,nightgowns,and,petticoats,of,the,finest,linen,trimmed,with,dainty,embroidery,and,infinitesimal,tucks,<END>
and,the,satin,slippers,rhett,bought,her,<END>
they,had,heels,three,inches,high,and,huge,glittering,paste,buckles,on,them,<END>
and,silk,stockings,a,dozen,pairs,and,not,a,one,had,cotton,tops,<END>
what,riches,<END>
she,recklessly,bought,gifts,for,the,family,<END>
a,furry,st,bernard,puppy,for,wade,who,had,always,longed,for,one,a,persian,kitten,for,beau,a,coral,bracelet,for,little,ella,a,heavy,necklace,with,moonstone,pendants,for,aunt,pitty,a,complete,set,of,shakespeare,for,melanie,and,ashley,an,elaborate,livery,for,uncle,peter,including,a,high,silk,coachman's,hat,with,a,brush,upon,it,dress,lengths,for,dilcey,and,cookie,expensive,gifts,for,everyone,at,tara,<END>
but,what,have,you,bought,for,mammy,<END>
questioned,rhett,looking,over,the,pile,of,gifts,spread,out,on,the,bed,in,their,hotel,room,and,removing,the,puppy,and,kitten,to,the,dressing,room,<END>
not,a,thing,<END>
she,was,hateful,<END>
why,should,i,bring,her,a,present,when,she,called,us,mules,<END>
why,should,you,so,resent,hearing,the,truth,my,pet,<END>
you,must,bring,mammy,a,present,<END>
it,would,break,her,heart,if,you,didn't,and,hearts,like,hers,are,too,valuable,to,be,broken,<END>
i,won't,take,her,a,thing,<END>
she,doesn't,deserve,it,<END>
then,i'll,buy,her,one,<END>
i,remember,my,mammy,always,said,that,when,she,went,to,heaven,she,wanted,a,taffeta,petticoat,so,stiff,that,it,would,stand,by,itself,and,so,rustly,that,the,lord,god,would,think,it,was,made,of,angels',wings,<END>
i'll,buy,mammy,some,red,taffeta,and,have,an,elegant,petticoat,made,<END>
she,won't,take,it,from,you,<END>
she'd,die,rather,than,wear,it,<END>
i,don't,doubt,it,<END>
but,i'll,make,the,gesture,just,the,same,<END>
the,shops,of,new,orleans,were,so,rich,and,exciting,and,shopping,with,rhett,was,an,adventure,<END>
dining,with,him,was,an,adventure,too,and,one,more,thrilling,than,shopping,for,he,knew,what,to,order,and,how,it,should,be,cooked,<END>
the,wines,and,liqueurs,and,champagnes,of,new,orleans,were,new,and,exhilarating,to,her,acquainted,with,only,homemade,blackberry,and,scuppernong,vintages,and,aunt,pitty's,swoon,brandy,but,oh,the,food,rhett,ordered,<END>
best,of,all,things,in,new,orleans,was,the,food,<END>
remembering,the,bitter,hungry,days,at,tara,and,her,more,recent,penury,scarlett,felt,that,she,could,never,eat,enough,of,these,rich,dishes,<END>
gumboes,and,shrimp,creole,doves,in,wine,and,oysters,in,crumbly,patties,full,of,creamy,sauce,mushrooms,and,sweetbreads,and,turkey,livers,fish,baked,cunningly,in,oiled,paper,and,limes,<END>
her,appetite,never,dulled,for,whenever,she,remembered,the,everlasting,goobers,and,dried,peas,and,sweet,potatoes,at,tara,she,felt,an,urge,to,gorge,herself,anew,of,creole,dishes,<END>
you,eat,as,though,each,meal,were,your,last,said,rhett,<END>
don't,scrape,the,plate,scarlett,<END>
i'm,sure,there's,more,in,the,kitchen,<END>
you,have,only,to,ask,the,waiter,<END>
if,you,don't,stop,being,such,a,glutton,you'll,be,as,fat,as,the,cuban,ladies,and,then,i,shall,divorce,you,<END>
but,she,only,put,out,her,tongue,at,him,and,ordered,another,pastry,thick,with,chocolate,and,stuffed,with,meringue,<END>
what,fun,it,was,to,be,able,to,spend,as,much,money,as,you,liked,and,not,count,pennies,and,feel,that,you,should,save,them,to,pay,taxes,or,buy,mules,<END>
what,fun,to,be,with,people,who,were,gay,and,rich,and,not,genteelly,poor,like,atlanta,people,<END>
what,fun,to,wear,rustling,brocade,dresses,that,showed,your,waist,and,all,your,neck,and,arms,and,more,than,a,little,of,your,breast,and,know,that,men,were,admiring,you,<END>
and,what,fun,to,eat,all,you,wanted,without,having,censorious,people,say,you,weren't,ladylike,<END>
and,what,fun,to,drink,all,the,champagne,you,pleased,<END>
the,first,time,she,drank,too,much,she,was,embarrassed,when,she,awoke,the,next,morning,with,a,splitting,headache,and,an,awful,memory,of,singing,bonnie,blue,flag,all,the,way,back,to,the,hotel,through,the,streets,of,new,orleans,in,an,open,carriage,<END>
she,had,never,seen,a,lady,even,tipsy,and,the,only,drunken,woman,she,had,ever,seen,had,been,that,watling,creature,on,the,day,when,atlanta,fell,<END>
she,hardly,knew,how,to,face,rhett,so,great,was,her,humiliation,but,the,affair,seemed,only,to,amuse,him,<END>
everything,she,did,seemed,to,amuse,him,as,though,she,were,a,gamboling,kitten,<END>
it,was,exciting,to,go,out,with,him,for,he,was,so,handsome,<END>
somehow,she,had,never,given,his,looks,a,thought,before,and,in,atlanta,everyone,had,been,too,preoccupied,with,his,shortcomings,ever,to,talk,about,his,appearance,<END>
but,here,in,new,orleans,she,could,see,how,the,eyes,of,other,women,followed,him,and,how,they,fluttered,when,he,bent,over,their,hands,<END>
the,realization,that,other,women,were,attracted,by,her,husband,and,perhaps,envied,her,made,her,suddenly,proud,to,be,seen,by,his,side,<END>
why,we're,a,handsome,people,thought,scarlett,with,pleasure,<END>
yes,as,rhett,had,prophesied,marriage,could,be,a,lot,of,fun,<END>
not,only,was,it,fun,but,she,was,learning,many,things,<END>
that,was,odd,in,itself,because,scarlett,had,thought,life,could,teach,her,no,more,<END>
now,she,felt,like,a,child,every,day,on,the,brink,of,a,new,discovery,<END>
first,she,learned,that,marriage,with,rhett,was,a,far,different,matter,from,marriage,with,either,charles,or,frank,<END>
they,had,respected,her,and,been,afraid,of,her,temper,<END>
they,had,begged,for,favors,and,if,it,pleased,her,she,had,bestowed,them,<END>
rhett,did,not,fear,her,and,she,often,thought,did,not,respect,her,very,much,either,<END>
what,he,wanted,to,do,he,did,and,if,she,did,not,like,it,he,laughed,at,her,<END>
she,did,not,love,him,but,he,was,undoubtedly,an,exciting,person,to,live,with,<END>
the,most,exciting,thing,about,him,was,that,even,in,his,outbursts,of,passion,which,were,flavored,sometimes,with,cruelty,sometimes,with,irritating,amusement,he,seemed,always,to,be,holding,himself,under,restraint,always,riding,his,emotions,with,a,curb,bit,<END>
i,guess,that's,because,he,isn't,really,in,love,with,me,she,thought,and,was,content,enough,with,the,state,of,affairs,<END>
i,should,hate,for,him,to,ever,turn,completely,loose,in,any,way,<END>
but,still,the,thought,of,the,possibility,teased,her,curiosity,in,an,exciting,way,<END>
living,with,rhett,she,learned,many,new,things,about,him,and,she,had,thought,she,knew,him,so,well,<END>
she,learned,that,his,voice,could,be,as,silky,as,a,cat's,fur,one,moment,and,crisp,and,crackling,with,oaths,the,next,<END>
he,could,tell,with,apparent,sincerity,and,approval,stories,of,courage,and,honor,and,virtue,and,love,in,the,odd,places,he,had,been,and,follow,them,with,ribald,stories,of,coldest,cynicism,<END>
she,knew,no,man,should,tell,such,stories,to,his,wife,but,they,were,entertaining,and,they,appealed,to,something,coarse,and,earthy,in,her,<END>
he,could,be,an,ardent,almost,a,tender,lover,for,a,brief,while,and,almost,immediately,a,mocking,devil,who,ripped,the,lid,from,her,gunpowder,temper,fired,it,and,enjoyed,the,explosion,<END>
she,learned,that,his,compliments,were,always,two,edged,and,his,tenderest,expressions,open,to,suspicion,<END>
in,fact,in,those,two,weeks,in,new,orleans,she,learned,everything,about,him,except,what,he,really,was,<END>
some,mornings,he,dismissed,the,maid,and,brought,her,the,breakfast,tray,himself,and,fed,her,as,though,she,were,a,child,took,the,hairbrush,from,her,hand,and,brushed,her,long,dark,hair,until,it,snapped,and,crackled,<END>
yet,other,mornings,she,was,torn,rudely,out,of,deep,slumber,when,he,snatched,all,the,bed,covers,from,her,and,tickled,her,bare,feet,<END>
sometimes,he,listened,with,dignified,interest,to,details,of,her,businesses,nodding,approval,at,her,sagacity,and,at,other,times,he,called,her,somewhat,dubious,tradings,scavenging,highway,robbery,and,extortion,<END>
he,took,her,to,plays,and,annoyed,her,by,whispering,that,god,probably,didn't,approve,of,such,amusements,and,to,churches,and,sotto,voce,retailed,funny,obscenities,and,then,reproved,her,for,laughing,<END>
he,encouraged,her,to,speak,her,mind,to,be,flippant,and,daring,<END>
she,picked,up,from,him,the,gift,of,stinging,words,and,sardonic,phrases,and,learned,to,relish,using,them,for,the,power,they,gave,her,over,other,people,<END>
but,she,did,not,possess,his,sense,of,humor,which,tempered,his,malice,nor,his,smile,that,jeered,at,himself,even,while,he,was,jeering,others,<END>
he,made
