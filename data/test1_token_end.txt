prologue,<END>
the,night,was,rank,with,the,smell,of,man,<END>
the,warg,stopped,beneath,a,tree,and,sniffed,his,grey-brown,fur,dappled,by,shadow,<END>
a,sigh,of,piney,wind,brought,the,man-scent,to,him,over,fainter,smells,that,spoke,of,fox,and,hare,seal,and,stag,even,wolf,<END>
those,were,man-smells,too,the,warg,knew,the,stink,of,old,skins,dead,and,sour,near,drowned,beneath,the,stronger,scents,of,smoke,and,blood,and,rot,<END>
only,man,stripped,the,skins,from,other,beasts,and,wore,their,hides,and,hair,<END>
wargs,have,no,fear,of,man,as,wolves,do,<END>
hate,and,hunger,coiled,in,his,belly,and,he,gave,a,low,growl,calling,to,his,one-eyed,brother,to,his,small,sly,sister,<END>
as,he,raced,through,the,trees,his,packmates,followed,hard,on,his,heels,<END>
they,had,caught,the,scent,as,well,<END>
as,he,ran,he,saw,through,their,eyes,too,and,glimpsed,himself,ahead,<END>
the,breath,of,the,pack,puffed,warm,and,white,from,long,grey,jaws,<END>
ice,had,frozen,between,their,paws,hard,as,stone,but,the,hunt,was,on,now,the,prey,ahead,<END>
flesh,the,warg,thought,meat,<END>
a,man,alone,was,a,feeble,thing,<END>
big,and,strong,with,good,sharp,eyes,but,dull,of,ear,and,deaf,to,smells,<END>
deer,and,elk,and,even,hares,were,faster,bears,and,boars,fiercer,in,a,fight,<END>
but,men,in,packs,were,dangerous,<END>
as,the,wolves,closed,on,the,prey,the,warg,heard,the,wailing,of,a,pup,the,crust,of,last,night's,snow,breaking,under,clumsy,man-paws,the,rattle,of,hardskins,and,the,long,grey,claws,men,carried,<END>
swords,a,voice,inside,him,whispered,spears,<END>
the,trees,had,grown,icy,teeth,snarling,down,from,the,bare,brown,branches,<END>
one,eye,ripped,through,the,undergrowth,spraying,snow,<END>
his,packmates,followed,<END>
up,a,hill,and,down,the,slope,beyond,until,the,wood,opened,before,them,and,the,men,were,there,<END>
one,was,female,<END>
the,fur-wrapped,bundle,she,clutched,was,her,pup,<END>
leave,her,for,last,the,voice,whispered,the,males,are,the,danger,<END>
they,were,roaring,at,each,other,as,men,did,but,the,warg,could,smell,their,terror,<END>
one,had,a,wooden,tooth,as,tall,as,he,was,<END>
he,flung,it,but,his,hand,was,shaking,and,the,tooth,sailed,high,<END>
then,the,pack,was,on,them,<END>
his,one-eyed,brother,knocked,the,tooth-thrower,back,into,a,snowdrift,and,tore,his,throat,out,as,he,struggled,<END>
his,sister,slipped,behind,the,other,male,and,took,him,from,the,rear,<END>
that,left,the,female,and,her,pup,for,him,<END>
she,had,a,tooth,too,a,little,one,made,of,bone,but,she,dropped,it,when,the,warg's,jaws,closed,around,her,leg,<END>
as,she,fell,she,wrapped,both,arms,around,her,noisy,pup,<END>
underneath,her,furs,the,female,was,just,skin,and,bones,but,her,dugs,were,full,of,milk,<END>
the,sweetest,meat,was,on,the,pup,<END>
the,wolf,saved,the,choicest,parts,for,his,brother,<END>
all,around,the,carcasses,the,frozen,snow,turned,pink,and,red,as,the,pack,filled,its,bellies,<END>
leagues,away,in,a,one-room,hut,of,mud,and,straw,with,a,thatched,roof,and,a,smoke,hole,and,a,floor,of,hard-packed,earth,varamyr,shivered,and,coughed,and,licked,his,lips,<END>
his,eyes,were,red,his,lips,cracked,his,throat,dry,and,parched,but,the,taste,of,blood,and,fat,filled,his,mouth,even,as,his,swollen,belly,cried,for,nourishment,<END>
a,child's,flesh,he,thought,remembering,bump,<END>
human,meat,<END>
had,he,sunk,so,low,as,to,hunger,after,human,meat,<END>
he,could,almost,hear,haggon,growling,at,him,<END>
men,may,eat,the,flesh,of,beasts,and,beasts,the,flesh,of,men,but,the,man,who,eats,the,flesh,of,man,is,an,abomination,<END>
abomination,<END>
that,had,always,been,haggon's,favorite,word,<END>
abomination,abomination,abomination,<END>
to,eat,of,human,meat,was,abomination,to,mate,as,wolf,with,wolf,was,abomination,and,to,seize,the,body,of,another,man,was,the,worst,abomination,of,all,<END>
haggon,was,weak,afraid,of,his,own,power,<END>
he,died,weeping,and,alone,when,i,ripped,his,second,life,from,him,<END>
varamyr,had,devoured,his,heart,himself,<END>
he,taught,me,much,and,more,and,the,last,thing,i,learned,from,him,was,the,taste,of,human,flesh,<END>
that,was,as,a,wolf,though,<END>
he,had,never,eaten,the,meat,of,men,with,human,teeth,<END>
he,would,not,grudge,his,pack,their,feast,however,<END>
the,wolves,were,as,famished,as,he,was,gaunt,and,cold,and,hungry,and,the,prey,two,men,and,a,woman,a,babe,in,arms,fleeing,from,defeat,to,death,<END>
they,would,have,perished,soon,in,any,case,from,exposure,or,starvation,<END>
this,way,was,better,quicker,<END>
a,mercy,<END>
a,mercy,he,said,aloud,<END>
his,throat,was,raw,but,it,felt,good,to,hear,a,human,voice,even,his,own,<END>
the,air,smelled,of,mold,and,damp,the,ground,was,cold,and,hard,and,his,fire,was,giving,off,more,smoke,than,heat,<END>
he,moved,as,close,to,the,flames,as,he,dared,coughing,and,shivering,by,turns,his,side,throbbing,where,his,wound,had,opened,<END>
blood,had,soaked,his,breeches,to,the,knee,and,dried,into,a,hard,brown,crust,<END>
thistle,had,warned,him,that,might,happen,<END>
i,sewed,it,up,the,best,i,could,she'd,said,but,you,need,to,rest,and,let,it,mend,or,the,flesh,will,tear,open,again,<END>
thistle,had,been,the,last,of,his,companions,a,spearwife,tough,as,an,old,root,warty,windburnt,and,wrinkled,<END>
the,others,had,deserted,them,along,the,way,<END>
one,by,one,they,fell,behind,or,forged,ahead,making,for,their,old,villages,or,the,milkwater,or,hardhome,or,a,lonely,death,in,the,woods,<END>
varamyr,did,not,know,and,could,not,care,<END>
i,should,have,taken,one,of,them,when,i,had,the,chance,<END>
one,of,the,twins,or,the,big,man,with,the,scarred,face,or,the,youth,with,the,red,hair,<END>
he,had,been,afraid,though,<END>
one,of,the,others,might,have,realized,what,was,happening,<END>
then,they,would,have,turned,on,him,and,killed,him,<END>
and,haggon's,words,had,haunted,him,and,so,the,chance,had,passed,<END>
after,the,battle,there,had,been,thousands,of,them,struggling,through,the,forest,hungry,frightened,fleeing,the,carnage,that,had,descended,on,them,at,the,wall,<END>
some,had,talked,of,returning,to,the,homes,that,they'd,abandoned,others,of,mounting,a,second,assault,upon,the,gate,but,most,were,lost,with,no,notion,of,where,to,go,or,what,to,do,<END>
they,had,escaped,the,black-cloaked,crows,and,the,knights,in,their,grey,steel,but,more,relentless,enemies,stalked,them,now,<END>
every,day,left,more,corpses,by,the,trails,<END>
some,died,of,hunger,some,of,cold,some,of,sickness,<END>
others,were,slain,by,those,who,had,been,their,brothersin-arms,when,they,marched,south,with,mance,rayder,the,king-beyond-the-wall,<END>
mance,is,fallen,the,survivors,told,each,other,in,despairing,voices,mance,is,taken,mance,is,dead,<END>
harma's,dead,and,mance,is,captured,the,rest,run,off,and,left,us,thistle,had,claimed,as,she,was,sewing,up,his,wound,<END>
tormund,the,weeper,sixskins,all,them,brave,raiders,<END>
where,are,they,now,<END>
she,does,not,know,me,varamyr,realized,then,and,why,should,she,<END>
without,his,beasts,he,did,not,look,like,a,great,man,<END>
i,was,varamyr,sixskins,who,broke,bread,with,mance,rayder,<END>
he,had,named,himself,varamyr,when,he,was,ten,<END>
a,name,fit,for,a,lord,a,name,for,songs,a,mighty,name,and,fearsome,<END>
yet,he,had,run,from,the,crows,like,a,frightened,rabbit,<END>
the,terrible,lord,varamyr,had,gone,craven,but,he,could,not,bear,that,she,should,know,that,so,he,told,the,spearwife,that,his,name,was,haggon,<END>
afterward,he,wondered,why,that,name,had,come,to,his,lips,of,all,those,he,might,have,chosen,<END>
i,ate,his,heart,and,drank,his,blood,and,still,he,haunts,me,<END>
one,day,as,they,fled,a,rider,came,galloping,through,the,woods,on,a,gaunt,white,horse,shouting,that,they,all,should,make,for,the,milkwater,that,the,weeper,was,gathering,warriors,to,cross,the,bridge,of,skulls,and,take,the,shadow,tower,<END>
many,followed,him,more,did,not,<END>
later,a,dour,warrior,in,fur,and,amber,went,from,cookfire,to,cookfire,urging,all,the,survivors,to,head,north,and,take,refuge,in,the,valley,of,the,thenns,<END>
why,he,thought,they,would,be,safe,there,when,the,thenns,themselves,had,fled,the,place,varamyr,never,learned,but,hundreds,followed,him,<END>
hundreds,more,went,off,with,the,woods,witch,who'd,had,a,vision,of,a,fleet,of,ships,coming,to,carry,the,free,folk,south,<END>
we,must,seek,the,sea,cried,mother,mole,and,her,followers,turned,east,<END>
varamyr,might,have,been,amongst,them,if,only,he'd,been,stronger,<END>
the,sea,was,grey,and,cold,and,far,away,though,and,he,knew,that,he,would,never,live,to,see,it,<END>
he,was,nine,times,dead,and,dying,and,this,would,be,his,true,death,<END>
a,squirrel-skin,cloak,he,remembered,he,knifed,me,for,a,squirrel-skin,cloak,<END>
its,owner,had,been,dead,the,back,of,her,head,smashed,into,red,pulp,flecked,with,bits,of,bone,but,her,cloak,looked,warm,and,thick,<END>
it,was,snowing,and,varamyr,had,lost,his,own,cloaks,at,the,wall,<END>
his,sleeping,pelts,and,woolen,smallclothes,his,sheepskin,boots,and,fur-lined,gloves,his,store,of,mead,and,hoarded,food,the,hanks,of,hair,he,took,from,the,women,he,bedded,even,the,golden,arm,rings,mance,had,given,him,all,lost,and,left,behind,<END>
i,burned,and,i,died,and,then,i,ran,half-mad,with,pain,and,terror,<END>
the,memory,still,shamed,him,but,he,had,not,been,alone,<END>
others,had,run,as,well,hundreds,of,them,thousands,<END>
the,battle,was,lost,<END>
the,knights,had,come,invincible,in,their,steel,killing,everyone,who,stayed,to,fight,<END>
it,was,run,or,die,<END>
death,was,not,so,easily,outrun,however,<END>
so,when,varamyr,came,upon,the,dead,woman,in,the,wood,he,knelt,to,strip,the,cloak,from,her,and,never,saw,the,boy,until,he,burst,from,hiding,to,drive,the,long,bone,knife,into,his,side,and,rip,the,cloak,out,of,his,clutching,fingers,<END>
his,mother,thistle,told,him,later,after,the,boy,had,run,off,<END>
it,were,his,mother's,cloak,and,when,he,saw,you,robbing,her,she,was,dead,varamyr,said,wincing,as,her,bone,needle,pierced,his,flesh,<END>
someone,smashed,her,head,<END>
some,crow,<END>
no,crow,<END>
hornfoot,men,<END>
i,saw,it,<END>
her,needle,pulled,the,gash,in,his,side,closed,<END>
savages,and,who's,left,to,tame,them,<END>
no,one,<END>
if,mance,is,dead,the,free,folk,are,doomed,<END>
the,thenns,giants,and,the,hornfoot,men,the,cave-dwellers,with,their,filed,teeth,and,the,men,of,the,western,shore,with,their,chariots,of,bone,all,of,them,were,doomed,as,well,<END>
even,the,crows,<END>
they,might,not,know,it,yet,but,those,black-cloaked,bastards,would,perish,with,the,rest,<END>
the,enemy,was,coming,<END>
haggon's,rough,voice,echoed,in,his,head,<END>
you,will,die,a,dozen,deaths,boy,and,every,one,will,hurt,but,when,your,true,death,comes,you,will,live,again,<END>
the,second,life,is,simpler,and,sweeter,they,say,<END>
varamyr,sixskins,would,know,the,truth,of,that,soon,enough,<END>
he,could,taste,his,true,death,in,the,smoke,that,hung,acrid,in,the,air,feel,it,in,the,heat,beneath,his,fingers,when,he,slipped,a,hand,under,his,clothes,to,touch,his,wound,<END>
the,chill,was,in,him,too,though,deep,down,in,his,bones,<END>
this,time,it,would,be,cold,that,killed,him,<END>
his,last,death,had,been,by,fire,<END>
i,burned,<END>
at,first,in,his,confusion,he,thought,some,archer,on,the,wall,had,pierced,him,with,a,flaming,arrow,but,the,fire,had,been,inside,him,consuming,him,<END>
and,the,pain,varamyr,had,died,nine,times,before,<END>
he,had,died,once,from,a,spear,thrust,once,with,a,bear's,teeth,in,his,throat,and,once,in,a,wash,of,blood,as,he,brought,forth,a,stillborn,cub,<END>
he,died,his,first,death,when,he,was,only,six,as,his,father's,axe,crashed,through,his,skull,<END>
even,that,had,not,been,so,agonizing,as,the,fire,in,his,guts,crackling,along,his,wings,devouring,him,<END>
when,he,tried,to,fly,from,it,his,terror,fanned,the,flames,and,made,them,burn,hotter,<END>
one,moment,he,had,been,soaring,above,the,wall,his,eagle's,eyes,marking,the,movements,of,the,men,below,<END>
then,the,flames,had,turned,his,heart,into,a,blackened,cinder,and,sent,his,spirit,screaming,back,into,his,own,skin,and,for,a,little,while,he'd,gone,mad,<END>
even,the,memory,was,enough,to,make,him,shudder,<END>
that,was,when,he,noticed,that,his,fire,had,gone,out,<END>
only,a,grey-and-black,tangle,of,charred,wood,remained,with,a,few,embers,glowing,in,the,ashes,<END>
there's,still,smoke,it,just,needs,wood,<END>
gritting,his,teeth,against,the,pain,varamyr,crept,to,the,pile,of,broken,branches,thistle,had,gathered,before,she,went,off,hunting,and,tossed,a,few,sticks,onto,the,ashes,<END>
catch,he,croaked,<END>
burn,<END>
he,blew,upon,the,embers,and,said,a,wordless,prayer,to,the,nameless,gods,of,wood,and,hill,and,field,<END>
the,gods,gave,no,answer,<END>
after,a,while,the,smoke,ceased,to,rise,as,well,<END>
already,the,little,hut,was,growing,colder,<END>
varamyr,had,no,flint,no,tinder,no,dry,kindling,<END>
he,would,never,get,the,fire,burning,again,not,by,himself,<END>
thistle,he,called,out,his,voice,hoarse,and,edged,with,pain,<END>
thistle,<END>
her,chin,was,pointed,and,her,nose,flat,and,she,had,a,mole,on,one,cheek,with,four,dark,hairs,growing,from,it,<END>
an,ugly,face,and,hard,yet,he,would,have,given,much,to,glimpse,it,in,the,door,of,the,hut,<END>
i,should,have,taken,her,before,she,left,<END>
how,long,had,she,been,gone,<END>
two,days,<END>
three,<END>
varamyr,was,uncertain,<END>
it,was,dark,inside,the,hut,and,he,had,been,drifting,in,and,out,of,sleep,never,quite,sure,if,it,was,day,or,night,outside,<END>
wait,she'd,said,<END>
i,will,be,back,with,food,<END>
so,like,a,fool,he'd,waited,dreaming,of,haggon,and,bump,and,all,the,wrongs,he,had,done,in,his,long,life,but,days,and,nights,had,passed,and,thistle,had,not,returned,<END>
she,won't,be,coming,back,<END>
varamyr,wondered,if,he,had,given,himself,away,<END>
could,she,tell,what,he,was,thinking,just,from,looking,at,him,or,had,he,muttered,in,his,fever,dream,<END>
abomination,he,heard,haggon,saying,<END>
it,was,almost,as,if,he,were,here,in,this,very,room,<END>
she,is,just,some,ugly,spearwife,varamyr,told,him,<END>
i,am,a,great,man,<END>
i,am,varamyr,the,warg,the,skinchanger,it,is,not,right,that,she,should,live,and,i,should,die,<END>
no,one,answered,<END>
there,was,no,one,there,<END>
thistle,was,gone,<END>
she,had,abandoned,him,the,same,as,all,the,rest,<END>
his,own,mother,had,abandoned,him,as,well,<END>
she,cried,for,bump,but,she,never,cried,for,me,<END>
the,morning,his,father,pulled,him,out,of,bed,to,deliver,him,to,haggon,she,would,not,even,look,at,him,<END>
he,had,shrieked,and,kicked,as,he,was,dragged,into,the,woods,until,his,father,slapped,him,and,told,him,to,be,quiet,<END>
you,belong,with,your,own,kind,was,all,he,said,when,he,flung,him,down,at,haggon's,feet,<END>
he,was,not,wrong,varamyr,thought,shivering,<END>
haggon,taught,me,much,and,more,<END>
he,taught,me,how,to,hunt,and,fish,how,to,butcher,a,carcass,and,bone,a,fish,how,to,find,my,way,through,the,woods,<END>
and,he,taught,me,the,way,of,the,warg,and,the,secrets,of,the,skinchanger,though,my,gift,was,stronger,than,his,own,<END>
years,later,he,had,tried,to,find,his,parents,to,tell,them,that,their,lump,had,become,the,great,varamyr,sixskins,but,both,of,them,were,dead,and,burned,<END>
gone,into,the,trees,and,streams,gone,into,the,rocks,and,earth,<END>
gone,to,dirt,and,ashes,<END>
that,was,what,the,woods,witch,told,his,mother,the,day,bump,died,<END>
lump,did,not,want,to,be,a,clod,of,earth,<END>
the,boy,had,dreamed,of,a,day,when,bards,would,sing,of,his,deeds,and,pretty,girls,would,kiss,him,<END>

he,never,had,but,he,had,come,close,<END>
varamyr,sixskins,was,a,name,men,feared,<END>
he,rode,to,battle,on,the,back,of,a,snow,bear,thirteen,feet,tall,kept,three,wolves,and,a,shadowcat,in,thrall,and,sat,at,the,right,hand,of,mance,rayder,<END>
it,was,mance,who,brought,me,to,this,place,<END>

i,should,have,slipped,inside,my,bear,and,torn,him,to,pieces,<END>
before,mance,varamyr,sixskins,had,been,a,lord,of,sorts,<END>
he,lived,alone,in,a,hall,of,moss,and,mud,and,hewn,logs,that,had,once,been,haggon's,attended,by,his,beasts,<END>
a,dozen,villages,did,him,homage,in,bread,and,salt,and,cider,offering,him,fruit,from,their,orchards,and,vegetables,from,their,gardens,<END>
his,meat,he,got,himself,<END>
whenever,he,desired,a,woman,he,sent,his,shadowcat,to,stalk,her,and,whatever,girl,he'd,cast,his,eye,upon,would,follow,meekly,to,his,bed,<END>
some,came,weeping,aye,but,still,they,came,<END>
varamyr,gave,them,his,seed,took,a,hank,of,their,hair,to,remember,them,by,and,sent,them,back,<END>
from,time,to,time,some,village,hero,would,come,with,spear,in,hand,to,slay,the,beastling,and,save,a,sister,or,a,lover,or,a,daughter,<END>

outside,the,night,was,white,as,death,pale,thin,clouds,danced,attendance,on,a,silver,moon,while,a,thousand,stars,watched,coldly,<END>

to,the,south,and,west,the,hills,were,a,vast,white,wilderness,where,nothing,moved,except,the,blowing,snow,<END>

a,wave,of,dizziness,washed,over,varamyr,<END>

the,water,was,so,cold,that,he,could,barely,bring,himself,to,swallow,and,he,realized,once,again,how,hot,he,was,<END>

tyrion,told,him,to,be,quiet,and,kicked,feebly,as,a,huge,bald,sailor,tucked,him,under,one,arm,and,carried,him,squirming,to,the,hold,where,an,empty,wine,cask,awaited,him,<END>

a,drunken,dwarf,he,said,in,the,common,tongue,of,westeros,<END>
a,rotting,sea,cow,<END>
tyrion's,mouth,was,full,of,blood,<END>

a,bath,first,just,so,<END>

my,servants,shall,see,to,it,<END>
his,host,put,the,mallet,and,chisel,aside,<END>

the,fat,man,made,good,on,the,promised,bath,though,<END>
no,sooner,did,tyrion,lower,himself,into,the,hot,water,and,close,his,eyes,than,he,was,fast,asleep,<END>
he,woke,naked,on,a,goose-down,feather,bed,so,soft,it,felt,as,if,he,had,been,swallowed,by,a,cloud,<END>
his,tongue,was,growing,hair,and,his,throat,was,raw,but,his,cock,was,as,hard,as,an,iron,bar,<END>
he,rolled,from,the,bed,found,a,chamber,pot,and,commenced,to,filling,it,with,a,groan,of,pleasure,<END>
the,room,was,dim,but,there,were,bars,of,yellow,sunlight,showing,between,the,slats,of,the,shutters,<END>
tyrion,shook,the,last,drops,off,and,waddled,over,patterned,myrish,carpets,as,soft,as,new,spring,grass,<END>
awkwardly,he,climbed,the,window,seat,and,flung,the,shutters,open,to,see,where,varys,and,the,gods,had,sent,him,<END>
beneath,his,window,six,cherry,trees,stood,sentinel,around,a,marble,pool,their,slender,branches,bare,and,brown,<END>
a,naked,boy,stood,on,the,water,poised,to,duel,with,a,bravo's,blade,in,hand,<END>
he,was,lithe,and,handsome,no,older,than,sixteen,with,straight,blond,hair,that,brushed,his,shoulders,<END>
so,lifelike,did,he,seem,that,it,took,the,dwarf,a,long,moment,to,realize,he,was,made,of,painted,marble,though,his,sword,shimmered,like,true,steel,<END>
across,the,pool,stood,a,brick,wall,twelve,feet,high,with,iron,spikes,along,its,top,<END>
beyond,that,was,the,city,<END>
a,sea,of,tiled,rooftops,crowded,close,around,a,bay,<END>
he,saw,square,brick,towers,a,great,red,temple,a,distant,manse,upon,a,hill,<END>
in,the,far,distance,sunlight,shimmered,off,deep,water,<END>
fishing,boats,were,moving,across,the,bay,their,sails,rippling,in,the,wind,and,he,could,see,the,masts,of,larger,ships,poking,up,along,the,shore,<END>
surely,one,is,bound,for,dorne,or,for,eastwatch-by-the-sea,<END>
he,had,no,means,to,pay,for,passage,though,nor,was,he,made,to,pull,an,oar,<END>
i,suppose,i,could,sign,on,as,a,cabin,boy,and,earn,my,way,by,letting,the,crew,bugger,me,up,and,down,the,narrow,sea,<END>
he,wondered,where,he,was,<END>
even,the,air,smells,different,here,<END>
strange,spices,scented,the,chilly,autumn,wind,and,he,could,hear,faint,cries,drifting,over,the,wall,from,the,streets,beyond,<END>
it,sounded,something,like,valyrian,but,he,did,not,recognize,more,than,one,word,in,five,<END>
not,braavos,he,concluded,nor,tyrosh,<END>
those,bare,branches,and,the,chill,in,the,air,argued,against,lys,and,myr,and,volantis,as,well,<END>
when,he,heard,the,door,opening,behind,him,tyrion,turned,to,confront,his,fat,host,<END>
this,is,pentos,yes,<END>
just,so,<END>
where,else,<END>
pentos,<END>
well,it,was,not,king's,landing,that,much,could,be,said,for,it,<END>
where,do,whores,go,<END>

whores,are,found,in,brothels,here,as,in,westeros,<END>
you,will,have,no,need,of,such,my,little,friend,<END>
choose,from,amongst,my,servingwomen,<END>
none,will,dare,refuse,you,<END>
slaves,<END>
the,dwarf,asked,pointedly,<END>
the,fat,man,stroked,one,of,the,prongs,of,his,oiled,yellow,beard,a,gesture,tyrion,found,remarkably,obscene,<END>
slavery,is,forbidden,in,pentos,by,the,terms,of,the,treaty,the,braavosi,imposed,on,us,a,hundred,years,ago,<END>
still,they,will,not,refuse,you,<END>
illyrio,gave,a,ponderous,half,bow,<END>
but,now,my,little,friend,must,excuse,me,<END>
i,have,the,honor,to,be,a,magister,of,this,great,city,and,the,prince,has,summoned,us,to,session,<END>
he,smiled,showing,a,mouth,full,of,crooked,yellow,teeth,<END>
explore,the,manse,and,grounds,as,you,like,but,on,no,account,stray,beyond,the,walls,<END>
it,is,best,that,no,man,knows,that,you,were,here,<END>
were,<END>
have,i,gone,somewhere,<END>
time,enough,to,speak,of,that,this,evening,<END>
my,little,friend,and,i,shall,eat,and,drink,and,make,great,plans,yes,<END>
yes,my,fat,friend,tyrion,replied,<END>
he,thinks,to,use,me,for,his,profit,<END>
it,was,all,profit,with,the,merchant,princes,of,the,free,cities,<END>
spice,soldiers,and,cheese,lords,his,lord,father,called,them,with,contempt,<END>
should,a,day,ever,dawn,when,illyrio,mopatis,saw,more,profit,in,a,dead,dwarf,than,a,live,one,tyrion,would,find,himself,packed,into,another,wine,cask,by,dusk,<END>
it,would,be,well,if,i,was,gone,before,that,day,arrives,<END>
that,it,would,arrive,he,did,not,doubt,cersei,was,not,like,to,forget,him,and,even,jaime,might,be,vexed,to,find,a,quarrel,in,father's,belly,<END>
a,light,wind,was,riffling,the,waters,of,the,pool,below,all,around,the,naked,swordsman,<END>
it,reminded,him,of,how,tysha,would,riffle,his,hair,during,the,false,spring,of,their,marriage,before,he,helped,his,father's,guardsmen,rape,her,<END>
he,had,been,thinking,of,those,guardsmen,during,his,flight,trying,to,recall,how,many,there,had,been,<END>
you,would,think,he,might,remember,that,but,no,<END>
a,dozen,<END>
a,score,<END>
a,hundred,<END>
he,could,not,say,<END>
they,had,all,been,grown,men,tall,and,strong,though,all,men,were,tall,to,a,dwarf,of,thirteen,years,<END>
tysha,knew,their,number,<END>
each,of,them,had,given,her,a,silver,stag,so,she,would,only,need,to,count,the,coins,<END>
a,silver,for,each,and,a,gold,for,me,<END>
his,father,had,insisted,that,he,pay,her,too,<END>
a,lannister,always,pays,his,debts,<END>
wherever,whores,go,he,heard,lord,tywin,say,once,more,and,once,more,the,bowstring,thrummed,<END>
the,magister,had,invited,him,to,explore,the,manse,<END>
he,found,clean,clothes,in,a,cedar,chest,inlaid,with,lapis,and,mother-of-pearl,<END>
the,clothes,had,been,made,for,a,small,boy,he,realized,as,he,struggled,into,them,<END>
the,fabrics,were,rich,enough,if,a,little,musty,but,the,cut,was,too,long,in,the,legs,and,too,short,in,the,arms,with,a,collar,that,would,have,turned,his,face,as,black,as,joffrey's,had,he,somehow,contrived,to,get,it,fastened,<END>
moths,had,been,at,them,too,<END>
at,least,they,do,not,stink,of,vomit,<END>
tyrion,began,his,explorations,with,the,kitchen,where,two,fat,women,and,a,potboy,watched,him,warily,as,he,helped,himself,to,cheese,bread,and,figs,<END>
good,morrow,to,you,fair,ladies,he,said,with,a,bow,<END>
do,you,know,where,whores,go,<END>
when,they,did,not,respond,he,repeated,the,question,in,high,valyrian,though,he,had,to,say,courtesan,in,place,of,whore,<END>
the,younger,fatter,cook,gave,him,a,shrug,that,time,<END>
he,wondered,what,they,would,do,if,he,took,them,by,the,hand,and,dragged,them,to,his,bedchamber,<END>
none,will,dare,refuse,you,illyrio,claimed,but,somehow,tyrion,did,not,think,he,meant,these,two,<END>
the,younger,woman,was,old,enough,to,be,his,mother,and,the,older,was,likely,her,mother,<END>
both,were,near,as,fat,as,illyrio,with,teats,that,were,larger,than,his,head,<END>
i,could,smother,myself,in,flesh,<END>
there,were,worse,ways,to,die,<END>
the,way,his,lord,father,had,died,for,one,<END>
i,should,have,made,him,shit,a,little,gold,before,expiring,<END>
lord,tywin,might,have,been,niggardly,with,his,approval,and,affection,but,he,had,always,been,open-handed,when,it,came,to,coin,<END>
the,only,thing,more,pitiful,than,a,dwarf,without,a,nose,is,a,dwarf,without,a,nose,who,has,no,gold,<END>
tyrion,left,the,fat,women,to,their,loaves,and,kettles,and,went,in,search,of,the,cellar,where,illyrio,had,decanted,him,the,night,before,<END>
it,was,not,hard,to,find,<END>
there,was,enough,wine,there,to,keep,him,drunk,for,a,hundred,years,sweet,reds,from,the,reach,and,sour,reds,from,dorne,pale,pentoshi,ambers,the,green,nectar,of,myr,three,score,casks,of,arbor,gold,even,wines,from,the,fabled,east,from,qarth,and,yi,ti,and,asshai,by,the,shadow,<END>
in,the,end,tyrion,chose,a,cask,of,strongwine,marked,as,the,private,stock,of,lord,runceford,redwyne,the,grandfather,of,the,present,lord,of,the,arbor,<END>
the,taste,of,it,was,languorous,and,heady,on,the,tongue,the,color,a,purple,so,dark,that,it,looked,almost,black,in,the,dim-lit,cellar,<END>
tyrion,filled,a,cup,and,a,flagon,for,good,measure,and,carried,them,up,to,the,gardens,to,drink,beneath,those,cherry,trees,he'd,seen,<END>
as,it,happened,he,left,by,the,wrong,door,and,never,found,the,pool,he,had,spied,from,his,window,but,it,made,no,matter,<END>
the,gardens,behind,the,manse,were,just,as,pleasant,and,far,more,extensive,<END>
he,wandered,through,them,for,a,time,drinking,<END>
the,walls,would,have,shamed,any,proper,castle,and,the,ornamental,iron,spikes,along,the,top,looked,strangely,naked,without,heads,to,adorn,them,<END>
tyrion,pictured,how,his,sister's,head,might,look,up,there,with,tar,in,her,golden,hair,and,flies,buzzing,in,and,out,of,her,mouth,<END>
yes,and,jaime,must,have,the,spike,beside,her,he,decided,<END>
no,one,must,ever,come,between,my,brother,and,my,sister,<END>
with,a,rope,and,a,grapnel,he,might,be,able,to,get,over,that,wall,<END>
he,had,strong,arms,and,he,did,not,weigh,much,<END>
he,should,be,able,to,clamber,over,if,he,did,not,impale,himself,on,a,spike,<END>
i,will,search,for,a,rope,on,the,morrow,he,resolved,<END>
he,saw,three,gates,during,his,wanderings,the,main,entrance,with,its,gatehouse,a,postern,by,the,kennels,and,a,garden,gate,hidden,behind,a,tangle,of,pale,ivy,<END>
the,last,was,chained,the,others,guarded,<END>
the,guards,were,plump,their,faces,as,smooth,as,babies',bottoms,and,every,man,of,them,wore,a,spiked,bronze,cap,<END>
tyrion,knew,eunuchs,when,he,saw,them,<END>
he,knew,their,sort,by,reputation,<END>
they,feared,nothing,and,felt,no,pain,it,was,said,and,were,loyal,to,their,masters,unto,death,<END>
i,could,make,good,use,of,a,few,hundred,of,mine,own,he,reflected,<END>
a,pity,i,did,not,think,of,that,before,i,became,a,beggar,<END>
he,walked,along,a,pillared,gallery,and,through,a,pointed,arch,and,found,himself,in,a,tiled,courtyard,where,a,woman,was,washing,clothes,at,a,well,<END>
she,looked,to,be,his,own,age,with,dull,red,hair,and,a,broad,face,dotted,by,freckles,<END>
would,you,like,some,wine,<END>
he,asked,her,<END>
she,looked,at,him,uncertainly,<END>
i,have,no,cup,for,you,we'll,have,to,share,<END>
the,washerwoman,went,back,to,wringing,out,tunics,and,hanging,them,to,dry,<END>

tell,me,how,far,should,i,trust,magister,illyrio,<END>

i'd,be,so,grateful,why,i'll,even,wed,you,<END>
i,have,two,wives,already,why,not,three,<END>
ah,but,where,would,we,live,<END>

not,to,imply,that,you're,a,whore,my,dear,but,perhaps,you,know,where,they,go,<END>
or,better,yet,he,should,have,asked,his,father,<END>

she,loved,me,<END>
she,was,a,crofter's,daughter,she,loved,me,and,she,wed,me,she,put,her,trust,in,me,<END>
the,empty,flagon,slipped,from,his,hand,and,rolled,across,the,yard,<END>
tyrion,pushed,himself,off,the,bench,and,went,to,fetch,it,<END>
as,he,did,he,saw,some,mushrooms,growing,up,from,a,cracked,paving,tile,<END>
pale,white,they,were,with,speckles,and,red-ribbed,undersides,dark,as,blood,<END>
the,dwarf,snapped,one,off,and,sniffed,it,<END>

there,were,seven,of,the,mushrooms,<END>

he,picked,them,all,snatched,a,glove,down,from,the,line,wrapped,them,carefully,and,stuffed,them,down,his,pocket,<END>
the,effort,made,him,dizzy,so,afterward,he,crawled,back,onto,the,bench,curled,up,and,shut,his,eyes,<END>

my,lord,she,said,your,bath,awaits,<END>

i,am,sure,you,did,<END>
i,need,a,cup,of,wine,<END>
she,poured,for,him,<END>

my,name,is,of,no,interest,to,me,<END>

she,flushed,<END>

the,girl,could,not,grasp,the,question,<END>
is,it,a,riddle,m'lord,<END>
i'm,no,good,at,riddles,<END>

i,despise,riddles,myself,<END>
i,will,tell,you,nothing,<END>
do,me,the,same,favor,<END>
the,only,part,of,you,that,interests,me,is,the,part,between,your,legs,he,almost,said,<END>

afterward,she,rubbed,sweet-smelling,ointment,into,his,calves,to,ease,the,aches,and,dressed,him,once,again,in,boy's,clothing,a,musty,pair,of,burgundy,breeches,and,a,blue,velvet,doublet,lined,with,cloth-of-gold,<END>
will,my,lord,want,me,after,he,has,eaten,<END>

that,he,had,fucked,many,a,woman,who,loathed,the,very,sight,of,him,tyrion,lannister,had,no,doubt,but,the,others,had,at,least,the,grace,to,feign,affection,<END>
a,little,honest,loathing,might,be,refreshing,like,a,tart,wine,after,too,much,sweet,<END>

keep,your,mouth,shut,and,your,thighs,open,and,the,two,of,us,should,get,on,splendidly,<END>
he,gave,her,a,leer,hoping,for,a,taste,of,fear,but,all,she,gave,him,was,revulsion,<END>
no,one,fears,a,dwarf,<END>
even,lord,tywin,had,not,been,afraid,though,tyrion,had,held,a,crossbow,in,his,hands,<END>
do,you,moan,when,you,are,being,fucked,<END>

tyrion,lannister,had,lived,all,his,life,in,a,world,that,was,too,big,for,him,but,in,the,manse,of,illyrio,mopatis,the,sense,of,disproportion,assumed,grotesque,dimensions,<END>

then,came,quails,in,honey,a,saddle,of,lamb,goose,livers,drowned,in,wine,buttered,parsnips,and,suckling,pig,<END>
the,sight,of,it,all,made,tyrion,feel,queasy,but,he,forced,himself,to,try,a,spoon,of,soup,for,the,sake,of,politeness,and,once,he,had,tasted,it,he,was,lost,<END>
the,cooks,might,be,old,and,fat,but,they,knew,their,business,<END>
he,had,never,eaten,so,well,even,at,court,<END>
as,he,was,sucking,the,meat,off,the,bones,of,his,quail,he,asked,illyrio,about,the,morning's,summons,<END>

no,man,is,as,cursed,as,the,kinslayer,he,mused,but,i,could,learn,to,like,this,hell,<END>
this,is,so,illyrio,agreed,but,the,world,is,one,great,web,and,a,man,dare,not,touch,a,single,strand,lest,all,the,others,tremble,<END>
more,wine,<END>
illyrio,popped,a,pepper,into,his,mouth,<END>
no,something,better,<END>
he,clapped,his,hands,together,<END>
at,the,sound,a,serving,man,entered,with,a,covered,dish,<END>

after,you,my,lord,<END>
he,pushed,the,dish,toward,his,host,<END>
no,no,<END>
magister,illyrio,pushed,the,mushrooms,back,<END>

after,you,<END>
i,insist,<END>

he,remembered,the,cook,the,flour,on,her,hands,heavy,breasts,shot,through,with,dark,blue,veins,<END>
that,was,kind,of,her,but,no,<END>
tyrion,eased,the,mushroom,back,into,the,lake,of,butter,from,which,it,had,emerged,<END>
you,are,too,suspicious,<END>
illyrio,smiled,through,his,forked,yellow,beard,<END>

yet,when,a,guest,plainly,wishes,to,end,his,own,life,why,his,host,must,oblige,him,no,<END>
he,took,a,gulp,<END>
magister,ordello,was,poisoned,by,a,mushroom,not,half,a,year,ago,<END>
the,pain,is,not,so,much,i,am,told,<END>
some,cramping,in,the,gut,a,sudden,ache,behind,the,eyes,and,it,is,done,<END>

why,die,with,the,taste,of,blood,in,your,mouth,when,it,could,be,butter,and,garlic,<END>
the,dwarf,studied,the,dish,before,him,<END>
the,smell,of,garlic,and,butter,had,his,mouth,watering,<END>
some,part,of,him,wanted,those,mushrooms,even,knowing,what,they,were,<END>
he,was,not,brave,enough,to,take,cold,steel,to,his,own,belly,but,a,bite,of,mushroom,would,not,be,so,hard,<END>
that,frightened,him,more,than,he,could,say,<END>
you,mistake,me,he,heard,himself,say,<END>
is,it,so,<END>

delicious,<END>
the,mushrooms,are,not,poisoned,<END>
tyrion,was,irritated,<END>
no,<END>
why,should,i,wish,you,ill,<END>
magister,illyrio,ate,another,<END>
we,must,show,a,little,trust,you,and,i,come,eat,<END>
he,clapped,his,hands,again,<END>

my,little,friend,must,keep,his,strength,up,<END>
the,serving,men,brought,out,a,heron,stuffed,with,figs,veal,cutlets,blanched,with,almond,milk,creamed,herring,candied,onions,foul-smelling,cheeses,plates,of,snails,and,sweetbreads,and,a,black,swan,in,her,plumage,<END>
tyrion,refused,the,swan,which,reminded,him,of,a,supper,with,his,sister,<END>

and,the,serving,men,filled,his,wine,cup,anew,each,time,he,emptied,it,<END>
you,drink,a,deal,of,wine,for,such,a,little,man,<END>

it,gives,a,man,a,thirst,<END>
the,fat,man's,eyes,glittered,like,the,gemstones,on,his,fingers,<END>
there,are,those,in,westeros,who,would,say,that,killing,lord,lannister,was,merely,a,good,beginning,<END>
they,had,best,not,say,it,in,my,sister's,hearing,or,they,will,find,themselves,short,a,tongue,<END>
the,dwarf,tore,a,loaf,of,bread,in,half,<END>
and,you,had,best,be,careful,what,you,say,of,my,family,magister,<END>
kinslayer,or,no,i,am,a,lion,still,<END>
that,seemed,to,amuse,the,lord,of,cheese,no,end,<END>
he,slapped,a,meaty,thigh,and,said,you,westerosi,are,all,the,same,<END>
you,sew,some,beast,upon,a,scrap,of,silk,and,suddenly,you,are,all,lions,or,dragons,or,eagles,<END>
i,can,take,you,to,a,real,lion,my,little,friend,<END>
the,prince,keeps,a,pride,in,his,menagerie,<END>

the,lords,of,the,seven,kingdoms,did,make,rather,much,of,their,sigils,tyrion,had,to,admit,<END>

a,lannister,is,not,a,lion,<END>
yet,i,am,still,my,father's,son,and,jaime,and,cersei,are,mine,to,kill,<END>
how,odd,that,you,should,mention,your,fair,sister,said,illyrio,between,snails,<END>
the,queen,has,offered,a,lordship,to,the,man,who,brings,her,your,head,no,matter,how,humble,his,birth,<END>
it,was,no,more,than,tyrion,had,expected,<END>
if,you,mean,to,take,her,up,on,it,make,her,spread,her,legs,for,you,as,well,<END>
the,best,part,of,me,for,the,best,part,of,her,that's,a,fair,trade,<END>
i,would,sooner,have,mine,own,weight,in,gold,<END>
the,cheesemonger,laughed,so,hard,that,tyrion,feared,he,was,about,to,rupture,<END>
all,the,gold,in,casterly,rock,why,not,<END>
the,gold,i,grant,you,the,dwarf,said,relieved,that,he,was,not,about,to,drown,in,a,gout,of,half-digested,eels,and,sweetmeats,but,the,rock,is,mine,<END>
just,so,<END>
the,magister,covered,his,mouth,and,belched,a,mighty,belch,<END>

i,am,told,he,is,a,great,one,for,the,law,<END>
your,brother,wears,the,white,cloak,so,you,are,heir,by,all,the,laws,of,westeros,<END>
stannis,might,well,grant,me,casterly,rock,said,tyrion,but,for,the,small,matter,of,regicide,and,kinslaying,<END>
for,those,he,would,shorten,me,by,a,head,and,i,am,short,enough,as,i,stand,<END>
but,why,would,you,think,i,mean,to,join,lord,stannis,<END>
why,else,would,you,go,the,wall,<END>
stannis,is,at,the,wall,<END>
tyrion,rubbed,at,his,nose,<END>
what,in,seven,bloody,hells,is,stannis,doing,at,the,wall,<END>
shivering,i,would,think,<END>
it,is,warmer,down,in,dorne,<END>

the,noble,grazdan,had,once,owned,a,slave,woman,who,was,a,very,fine,weaver,it,seemed,the,fruits,of,her,loom,were,greatly,valued,not,only,in,meereen,but,in,new,ghis,and,astapor,and,qarth,<END>

thereafter,she,alternated,between,the,former,masters,and,the,former,slaves,<END>
many,and,more,of,the,matters,brought,before,her,involved,redress,<END>
meereen,had,been,sacked,savagely,after,its,fall,<END>
the,stepped,pyramids,of,the,mighty,had,been,spared,the,worst,of,the,ravages,but,the,humbler,parts,of,the,city,had,been,given,over,to,an,orgy,of,looting,and,killing,as,the,city's,slaves,rose,up,and,the,starving,hordes,who,had,followed,her,from,yunkai,and,astapor,poured,through,the,broken,gates,<END>
her,unsullied,had,finally,restored,order,but,the,sack,left,a,plague,of,problems,in,its,wake,<END>

a,rich,woman,came,whose,husband,and,sons,had,died,defending,the,city,walls,<END>
during,the,sack,she,had,fled,to,her,brother,in,fear,<END>

a,former,slave,came,to,accuse,a,certain,noble,of,the,zhak,<END>
the,man,had,recently,taken,to,wife,a,freedwoman,who,had,been,the,noble's,bedwarmer,before,the,city,fell,<END>

her,new,husband,wanted,the,noble,gelded,for,the,crime,of,rape,and,he,wanted,a,purse,of,gold,as,well,to,pay,him,for,raising,the,noble's,bastard,as,his,own,<END>

by,law,there,was,no,rape,<END>
her,decision,did,not,please,him,she,could,see,but,if,she,gelded,every,man,who,ever,forced,a,bedslave,she,would,soon,rule,a,city,of,eunuchs,<END>
a,boy,came,younger,than,dany,slight,and,scarred,dressed,up,in,a,frayed,grey,tokar,trailing,silver,fringe,<END>

one,had,slain,his,father,the,other,his,elder,brother,<END>
both,had,raped,his,mother,before,killing,her,as,well,<END>
the,boy,had,escaped,with,no,more,than,the,scar,upon,his,face,but,one,of,the,murderers,was,still,living,in,his,father's,house,and,the,other,had,joined,the,queen's,soldiers,as,one,of,the,mother's,men,<END>
he,wanted,them,both,hanged,<END>
i,am,queen,over,a,city,built,on,dust,and,death,<END>
dany,had,no,choice,but,to,deny,him,<END>
she,had,declared,a,blanket,pardon,for,all,crimes,committed,during,the,sack,<END>
nor,would,she,punish,slaves,for,rising,up,against,their,masters,<END>
when,she,told,him,the,boy,rushed,at,her,but,his,feet,tangled,in,his,tokar,and,he,went,sprawling,headlong,on,the,purple,marble,<END>
strong,belwas,was,on,him,at,once,<END>

by,midday,daenerys,was,feeling,the,weight,of,the,crown,upon,her,head,and,the,hardness,of,the,bench,beneath,her,<END>
with,so,many,still,waiting,on,her,pleasure,she,did,not,stop,to,eat,<END>
instead,she,dispatched,jhiqui,to,the,kitchens,for,a,platter,of,flatbread,olives,figs,and,cheese,<END>
she,nibbled,whilst,she,listened,and,sipped,from,a,cup,of,watered,wine,<END>

the,next,hill,was,covered,with,pines,and,the,sharp,scent,of,their,needles,filled,the,air,<END>

the,direwolf,swung,his,head,from,side,to,side,nostrils,flaring,then,bared,his,fangs,in,a,snarl,<END>
the,younger,male,backed,away,<END>
the,direwolf,could,smell,the,fear,in,him,<END>

but,the,one-eyed,wolf,answered,with,a,growl,and,moved,to,block,his,advance,<END>
head,<END>
and,he,does,not,fear,me,though,i,am,twice,his,size,<END>
their,eyes,met,<END>

then,the,two,rushed,together,wolf,and,direwolf,and,there,was,no,more,time,for,thought,<END>
the,world,shrank,down,to,tooth,and,claw,snow,flying,as,they,rolled,and,spun,and,tore,at,one,another,the,other,wolves,snarling,and,snapping,around,them,<END>
his,jaws,closed,on,matted,fur,slick,with,hoarfrost,on,a,limb,thin,as,a,dry,stick,but,the,one-eyed,wolf,clawed,at,his,belly,and,tore,himself,free,rolled,lunged,for,him,<END>
yellow,fangs,snapped,closed,on,his,throat,but,he,shook,off,his,old,grey,cousin,as,he,would,a,rat,then,charged,after,him,knocked,him,down,<END>
rolling,ripping,kicking,they,fought,until,the,both,of,them,were,ragged,and,fresh,blood,dappled,the,snows,around,them,<END>
but,finally,the,old,one-eyed,wolf,lay,down,and,showed,his,belly,<END>
the,direwolf,snapped,at,him,twice,more,sniffed,at,his,butt,then,lifted,a,leg,over,him,<END>
a,few,snaps,and,a,warning,growl,and,the,female,and,the,tail,submitted,too,<END>
the,pack,was,his,<END>

his,other,hand,was,missing,severed,at,the,wrist,the,stump,bound,up,in,leather,<END>
blood,flowed,thick,and,sluggish,from,the,slash,across,his,throat,<END>
the,wolf,lapped,at,it,with,his,tongue,licked,the,ragged,eyeless,ruin,of,his,nose,and,cheeks,then,buried,his,muzzle,in,his,neck,and,tore,it,open,gulping,down,a,gobbet,of,sweet,meat,<END>
no,flesh,had,ever,tasted,half,as,good,<END>
when,he,was,done,with,that,one,he,moved,to,the,next,and,devoured,the,choicest,bits,of,that,man,too,<END>

no,man,must,see,you,leave,the,city,as,no,man,saw,you,enter,<END>

unless,you,removed,their,wits,along,with,their,balls,they,know,you're,not,alone,in,here,<END>

the,fastest,way,to,volantis,is,by,sea,<END>
the,sea,is,hazardous,replied,illyrio,<END>
autumn,is,a,season,rife,with,storms,and,pirates,still,make,their,dens,upon,the,stepstones,and,venture,forth,to,prey,on,honest,men,<END>

the,day,is,too,fine,for,such,talk,<END>
we,shall,see,the,rhoyne,soon,and,there,you,shall,be,rid,of,illyrio,and,his,big,belly,<END>
till,then,let,us,drink,and,dream,<END>
we,have,sweet,wine,and,savories,to,enjoy,<END>
why,dwell,upon,disease,and,death,<END>
why,indeed,<END>
tyrion,heard,the,thrum,of,a,crossbow,once,again,and,wondered,<END>
the,litter,swayed,side,to,side,a,soothing,movement,that,made,him,feel,as,if,he,were,a,child,being,rocked,to,sleep,in,his,mother's,arms,<END>
not,that,i,would,know,what,that,was,like,<END>
silk,pillows,stuffed,with,goose,down,cushioned,his,cheeks,<END>
the,purple,velvet,walls,curved,overhead,to,form,a,roof,making,it,pleasantly,warm,within,despite,the,autumn,chill,outside,<END>
a,train,of,mules,trailed,behind,them,carrying,chests,and,casks,and,barrels,and,hampers,of,delectables,to,keep,the,lord,of,cheese,from,growing,peckish,<END>
they,nibbled,on,spiced,sausage,that,morning,washed,down,with,a,dark,smokeberry,brown,<END>
jellied,eels,and,dornish,reds,filled,their,afternoon,<END>
come,evening,there,were,sliced,hams,boiled,eggs,and,roasted,larks,stuffed,with,garlic,and,onions,with,pale,ales,and,myrish,fire,wines,to,help,in,their,digestion,<END>
the,litter,was,as,slow,as,it,was,comfortable,however,and,the,dwarf,soon,found,himself,itching,with,impatience,<END>
how,many,days,until,we,reach,the,river,<END>
he,asked,illyrio,that,evening,<END>
at,this,pace,your,queen's,dragons,will,be,larger,than,aegon's,three,before,i,can,lay,eyes,upon,them,<END>
would,it,were,so,<END>
a,large,dragon,is,more,fearsome,than,a,small,one,<END>
the,magister,shrugged,<END>
much,as,it,would,please,me,to,welcome,queen,daenerys,to,volantis,i,must,rely,on,you,and,griff,for,that,<END>
i,can,serve,her,best,in,pentos,smoothing,the,way,for,her,return,<END>
so,long,as,i,am,with,you,though,well,an,old,fat,man,must,have,his,comforts,yes,<END>
come,drink,a,cup,of,wine,<END>
tell,me,tyrion,said,as,he,drank,why,should,a,magister,of,pentos,give,three,figs,who,wears,the,crown,in,westeros,<END>
where,is,the,gain,for,you,in,this,venture,my,lord,<END>
the,fat,man,dabbed,grease,from,his,lips,<END>
i,am,an,old,man,grown,weary,of,this,world,and,its,treacheries,<END>
is,it,so,strange,that,i,should,wish,to,do,some,good,before,my,days,are,done,to,help,a,sweet,young,girl,regain,her,birthright,<END>
next,you,will,be,offering,me,a,suit,of,magic,armor,and,a,palace,in,valyria,<END>
if,daenerys,is,no,more,than,a,sweet,young,girl,the,iron,throne,will,cut,her,into,sweet,young,pieces,<END>
fear,not,my,little,friend,<END>
the,blood,of,aegon,the,dragon,flows,in,her,veins,<END>
along,with,the,blood,of,aegon,the,unworthy,maegor,the,cruel,and,baelor,the,befuddled,<END>
tell,me,more,of,her,<END>
the,fat,man,grew,pensive,<END>
daenerys,was,half,a,child,when,she,came,to,me,yet,fairer,even,than,my,second,wife,so,lovely,i,was,tempted,to,claim,her,for,myself,<END>
such,a,fearful,furtive,thing,however,i,knew,i,should,get,no,joy,from,coupling,with,her,<END>
instead,i,summoned,a,bedwarmer,and,fucked,her,vigorously,until,the,madness,passed,<END>
if,truth,be,told,i,did,not,think,daenerys,would,survive,for,long,amongst,the,horselords,<END>
that,did,not,stop,you,selling,her,to,khal,drogo,dothraki,neither,buy,nor,sell,<END>
say,rather,that,her,brother,viserys,gave,her,to,drogo,to,win,the,khal's,friendship,<END>
a,vain,young,man,and,greedy,<END>
viserys,lusted,for,his,father's,throne,but,he,lusted,for,daenerys,too,and,was,loath,to,give,her,up,<END>
the,night,before,the,princess,wed,he,tried,to,steal,into,her,bed,insisting,that,if,he,could,not,have,her,hand,he,would,claim,her,maidenhead,<END>
had,i,not,taken,the,precaution,of,posting,guards,upon,her,door,viserys,might,have,undone,years,of,planning,<END>
he,sounds,an,utter,fool,<END>
viserys,was,mad,aerys's,son,just,so,<END>
daenerys,daenerys,is,quite,different,<END>
he,popped,a,roasted,lark,into,his,mouth,and,crunched,it,noisily,bones,and,all,<END>
the,frightened,child,who,sheltered,in,my,manse,died,on,the,dothraki,sea,and,was,reborn,in,blood,and,fire,<END>
this,dragon,queen,who,wears,her,name,is,a,true,targaryen,<END>
when,i,sent,ships,to,bring,her,home,she,turned,toward,slaver's,bay,<END>
in,a,short,span,of,days,she,conquered,astapor,made,yunkai,bend,the,knee,and,sacked,meereen,<END>
mantarys,will,be,next,if,she,marches,west,along,the,old,valyrian,roads,<END>
if,she,comes,by,sea,well,her,fleet,must,take,on,food,and,water,at,volantis,<END>
by,land,or,by,sea,there,are,long,leagues,between,meereen,and,volantis,tyrion,observed,<END>
five,hundred,fifty,as,the,dragon,flies,through,deserts,mountains,swamps,and,demon-haunted,ruins,<END>
many,and,more,will,perish,but,those,who,survive,will,be,stronger,by,the,time,they,reach,volantis,where,they,shall,find,you,and,griff,awaiting,them,with,fresh,forces,and,sufficient,ships,to,carry,them,all,across,the,sea,to,westeros,<END>
tyrion,pondered,all,he,knew,of,volantis,oldest,and,proudest,of,the,nine,free,cities,<END>
something,was,awry,here,<END>
even,with,half,a,nose,he,could,smell,it,<END>
it's,said,there,are,five,slaves,for,every,free,man,in,volantis,<END>
why,would,the,triarchs,assist,a,queen,who,smashed,the,slave,trade,<END>
he,pointed,at,illyrio,<END>
for,that,matter,why,would,you,<END>
slavery,may,be,forbidden,by,the,laws,of,pentos,yet,you,have,a,finger,in,that,trade,as,well,and,maybe,a,whole,hand,<END>
and,yet,you,conspire,for,the,dragon,queen,and,not,against,her,<END>
why,<END>
what,do,you,hope,to,gain,from,queen,daenerys,<END>
are,we,back,to,that,again,<END>
you,are,a,persistent,little,man,<END>
illyrio,gave,a,laugh,and,slapped,his,belly,<END>
as,you,will,<END>
the,beggar,king,swore,that,i,should,be,his,master,of,coin,and,a,lordly,lord,as,well,<END>
once,he,wore,his,golden,crown,i,should,have,my,choice,of,castles,even,casterly,rock,if,i,desired,<END>
tyrion,snorted,wine,back,up,the,scarred,stump,that,had,been,his,nose,<END>
my,father,would,have,loved,to,hear,that,<END>
your,lord,father,had,no,cause,for,concern,<END>
why,would,i,want,a,rock,<END>
my,manse,is,large,enough,for,any,man,and,more,comfortable,than,your,drafty,westerosi,castles,<END>
master,of,coin,though,the,fat,man,peeled,another,egg,<END>
i,am,fond,of,coins,<END>
is,there,any,sound,as,sweet,as,the,clink,of,gold,on,gold,<END>
a,sister's,screams,<END>
are,you,quite,certain,that,daenerys,will,make,good,her,brother's,promises,<END>
she,will,or,she,will,not,<END>
illyrio,bit,the,egg,in,half,<END>
i,told,you,my,little,friend,not,all,that,a,man,does,is,done,for,gain,<END>
believe,as,you,wish,but,even,fat,old,fools,like,me,have,friends,and,debts,of,affection,to,repay,<END>
liar,thought,tyrion,<END>
there,is,something,in,this,venture,worth,more,to,you,than,coin,or,castles,<END>
you,meet,so,few,men,who,value,friendship,over,gold,these,days,<END>
too,true,the,fat,man,said,deaf,to,the,irony,<END>
how,is,it,that,the,spider,became,so,dear,to,you,<END>
we,were,young,together,two,green,boys,in,pentos,<END>
varys,came,from,myr,<END>
so,he,did,<END>
i,met,him,not,long,after,he,arrived,one,step,ahead,of,the,slavers,<END>
by,day,he,slept,in,the,sewers,by,night,he,prowled,the,rooftops,like,a,cat,<END>
i,was,near,as,poor,a,bravo,in,soiled,silks,living,by,my,blade,<END>
perhaps,you,chanced,to,glimpse,the,statue,by,my,pool,<END>
pytho,malanon,carved,that,when,i,was,six-and-ten,<END>
a,lovely,thing,though,now,i,weep,to,see,it,<END>
age,makes,ruins,of,us,all,<END>
i,am,still,in,mourning,for,my,nose,<END>
but,varys,in,myr,he,was,a,prince,of,thieves,until,a,rival,thief,informed,on,him,<END>
in,pentos,his,accent,marked,him,and,once,he,was,known,for,a,eunuch,he,was,despised,and,beaten,<END>
why,he,chose,me,to,protect,him,i,may,never,know,but,we,came,to,an,arrangement,<END>
varys,spied,on,lesser,thieves,and,took,their,takings,<END>
i,offered,my,help,to,their,victims,promising,to,recover,their,valuables,for,a,fee,<END>
soon,every,man,who,had,suffered,a,loss,knew,to,come,to,me,whilst,city's,footpads,and,cutpurses,sought,out,varys,half,to,slit,his,throat,the,other,half,to,sell,him,what,they'd,stolen,<END>
we,both,grew,rich,and,richer,still,when,varys,trained,his,mice,<END>
in,king's,landing,he,kept,little,birds,<END>
mice,we,called,them,then,<END>
the,older,thieves,were,fools,who,thought,no,further,than,turning,a,night's,plunder,into,wine,<END>
varys,preferred,orphan,boys,and,young,girls,<END>
he,chose,the,smallest,the,ones,who,were,quick,and,quiet,and,taught,them,to,climb,walls,and,slip,down,chimneys,<END>
he,taught,them,to,read,as,well,<END>
we,left,the,gold,and,gems,for,common,thieves,<END>
instead,our,mice,stole,letters,ledgers,charts,later,they,would,read,them,and,leave,them,where,they,lay,<END>
secrets,are,worth,more,than,silver,or,sapphires,varys,claimed,<END>
just,so,<END>
i,grew,so,respectable,that,a,cousin,of,the,prince,of,pentos,let,me,wed,his,maiden,daughter,whilst,whispers,of,a,certain,eunuch's,talents,crossed,the,narrow,sea,and,reached,the,ears,of,a,certain,king,<END>
a,very,anxious,king,who,did,not,wholly,trust,his,son,nor,his,wife,nor,his,hand,a,friend,of,his,youth,who,had,grown,arrogant,and,overproud,<END>
i,do,believe,that,you,know,the,rest,of,this,tale,is,that,not,so,<END>
much,of,it,tyrion,admitted,<END>
i,see,that,you,are,somewhat,more,than,a,cheesemonger,after,all,<END>
illyrio,inclined,his,head,<END>
you,are,kind,to,say,so,my,little,friend,<END>
and,for,my,part,i,see,that,you,are,just,as,quick,as,lord,varys,claimed,<END>
he,smiled,showing,all,his,crooked,yellow,teeth,and,shouted,for,another,jar,of,myrish,fire,wine,<END>
when,the,magister,drifted,off,to,sleep,with,the,wine,jar,at,his,elbow,tyrion,crept,across,the,pillows,to,work,it,loose,from,its,fleshy,prison,and,pour,himself,a,cup,<END>
he,drained,it,down,and,yawned,and,filled,it,once,again,<END>
if,i,drink,enough,fire,wine,he,told,himself,perhaps,i'll,dream,of,dragons,<END>
when,he,was,still,a,lonely,child,in,the,depths,of,casterly,rock,he,oft,rode,dragons,through,the,nights,pretending,he,was,some,lost,targaryen,princeling,or,a,valyrian,dragonlord,soaring,high,o'er,fields,and,mountains,<END>
once,when,his,uncles,asked,him,what,gift,he,wanted,for,his,nameday,he,begged,them,for,a,dragon,<END>
it,wouldn't,need,to,be,a,big,one,<END>
it,could,be,little,like,i,am,<END>
his,uncle,gerion,thought,that,was,the,funniest,thing,he,had,ever,heard,but,his,uncle,tygett,said,the,last,dragon,died,a,century,ago,lad,<END>
that,had,seemed,so,monstrously,unfair,that,the,boy,had,cried,himself,to,sleep,that,night,<END>
yet,if,the,lord,of,cheese,could,be,believed,the,mad,king's,daughter,had,hatched,three,living,dragons,<END>
two,more,than,even,a,targaryen,should,require,<END>
tyrion,was,almost,sorry,that,he,had,killed,his,father,<END>
he,would,have,enjoyed,seeing,lord,tywin's,face,when,he,learned,that,there,was,a,targaryen,queen,on,her,way,to,westeros,with,three,dragons,backed,by,a,scheming,eunuch,and,a,cheesemonger,half,the,size,of,casterly,rock,<END>
the,dwarf,was,so,stuffed,that,he,had,to,undo,his,belt,and,the,topmost,laces,on,his,breeches,<END>
the,boy's,clothes,his,host,had,dressed,him,in,made,him,feel,like,ten,pounds,of,sausage,in,a,five-pound,skin,<END>
if,we,eat,this,way,every,day,i,will,be,the,size,of,illyrio,before,i,meet,this,dragon,queen,<END>
outside,the,litter,night,had,fallen,<END>
inside,all,was,dark,<END>
tyrion,listened,to,illyrio's,snores,the,creak,of,the,leather,straps,the,slow,clop,clop,of,the,team's,ironshod,hooves,on,the,hard,valyrian,road,but,his,heart,was,listening,for,the,beat,of,leathern,wings,<END>
when,he,woke,dawn,had,come,<END>
the,horses,plodded,on,the,litter,creaking,and,swaying,between,them,<END>
tyrion,pulled,the,curtain,back,an,inch,to,peer,outside,but,there,was,little,to,see,but,ochre,fields,bare,brown,elms,and,the,road,itself,a,broad,stone,highway,that,ran,straight,as,a,spear,to,the,horizon,<END>
he,had,read,about,valyrian,roads,but,this,was,the,first,he,had,seen,<END>
the,freehold's,grasp,had,reached,as,far,as,dragonstone,but,never,to,the,mainland,of,westeros,itself,<END>
odd,that,<END>
dragonstone,is,no,more,than,a,rock,<END>
the,wealth,was,farther,west,but,they,had,dragons,<END>
surely,they,knew,that,it,was,there,<END>
he,had,drunk,too,much,last,night,<END>
his,head,was,pounding,and,even,the,gentle,swaying,of,the,litter,was,enough,to,make,his,gorge,rise,in,his,throat,<END>
though,he,said,no,word,of,complaint,his,distress,must,have,been,plain,to,illyrio,mopatis,<END>
come,drink,with,me,the,fat,man,said,<END>
a,scale,from,the,dragon,that,burned,you,as,they,say,<END>
he,poured,for,them,from,a,flagon,of,blackberry,wine,so,sweet,that,it,drew,more,flies,than,honey,<END>
tyrion,shooed,them,off,with,the,back,of,his,hand,and,drank,deep,<END>
the,taste,was,so,cloying,that,it,was,all,he,could,do,to,keep,it,down,<END>
the,second,cup,went,down,easier,however,<END>
even,so,he,had,no,appetite,and,when,illyrio,offered,him,a,bowl,of,blackberries,in,cream,he,waved,it,off,<END>
i,dreamed,about,the,queen,he,said,<END>
i,was,on,my,knees,before,her,swearing,my,allegiance,but,she,mistook,me,for,my,brother,jaime,and,fed,me,to,her,dragons,<END>
let,us,hope,this,dream,was,not,prophetic,<END>
you,are,a,clever,imp,just,as,varys,said,and,daenerys,will,have,need,of,clever,men,about,her,<END>
ser,barristan,is,a,valiant,knight,and,true,but,none,i,think,has,ever,called,him,cunning,<END>
knights,know,only,one,way,to,solve,a,problem,<END>
they,couch,their,lances,and,charge,<END>
a,dwarf,has,a,different,way,of,looking,at,the,world,<END>
what,of,you,though,<END>
you,are,a,clever,man,yourself,<END>
you,flatter,me,<END>
illyrio,waggled,his,hand,<END>
alas,i,am,not,made,for,travel,so,i,will,send,you,to,daenerys,in,my,stead,<END>
you,did,her,grace,a,great,service,when,you,slew,your,father,and,it,is,my,hope,that,you,will,do,her,many,more,<END>
daenerys,is,not,the,fool,her,brother,was,<END>
she,will,make,good,use,of,you,<END>
as,kindling,<END>
tyrion,thought,smiling,pleasantly,<END>
they,changed,out,teams,only,thrice,that,day,but,seemed,to,halt,twice,an,hour,at,the,least,so,illyrio,could,climb,down,from,the,litter,and,have,himself,a,piss,<END>
our,lord,of,cheese,is,the,size,of,an,elephant,but,he,has,a,bladder,like,a,peanut,the,dwarf,mused,<END>
during,one,stop,he,used,the,time,to,have,a,closer,look,at,the,road,<END>
tyrion,knew,what,he,would,find,not,packed,earth,nor,bricks,nor,cobbles,but,a,ribbon,of,fused,stone,raised,a,half,foot,above,the,ground,to,allow,rainfall,and,snowmelt,to,run,off,its,shoulders,<END>
unlike,the,muddy,tracks,that,passed,for,roads,in,the,seven,kingdoms,the,valyrian,roads,were,wide,enough,for,three,wagons,to,pass,abreast,and,neither,time,nor,traffic,marred,them,<END>
they,still,endured,unchanging,four,centuries,after,valyria,itself,had,met,its,doom,<END>
he,looked,for,ruts,and,cracks,but,found,only,a,pile,of,warm,dung,deposited,by,one,of,the,horses,<END>
the,dung,made,him,think,of,his,lord,father,<END>
are,you,down,in,some,hell,father,<END>
a,nice,cold,hell,where,you,can,look,up,and,see,me,help,restore,mad,aerys's,daughter,to,the,iron,throne,<END>
as,they,resumed,their,journey,illyrio,produced,a,bag,of,roasted,chestnuts,and,began,to,speak,once,more,of,the,dragon,queen,<END>
our,last,news,of,queen,daenerys,is,old,and,stale,i,fear,<END>
by,now,she,will,have,left,meereen,we,must,assume,<END>
she,has,her,host,at,last,a,ragged,host,of,sellswords,dothraki,horselords,and,unsullied,infantry,and,she,will,no,doubt,lead,them,west,to,take,back,her,father's,throne,<END>
magister,illyrio,twisted,open,a,pot,of,garlic,snails,sniffed,at,them,and,smiled,<END>
at,volantis,you,will,have,fresh,tidings,of,daenerys,we,must,hope,he,said,as,he,sucked,one,from,its,shell,<END>
dragons,and,young,girls,are,both,capricious,and,it,may,be,that,you,will,need,to,adjust,your,plans,<END>
griff,will,know,what,to,do,<END>
will,you,have,a,snail,<END>
the,garlic,is,from,my,own,gardens,<END>
i,could,ride,a,snail,and,make,a,better,pace,than,this,litter,of,yours,<END>
tyrion,waved,the,dish,away,<END>
you,place,a,deal,of,trust,in,this,man,griff,<END>
another,friend,of,your,childhood,<END>
no,<END>
a,sellsword,you,would,call,him,but,westerosi,born,<END>
daenerys,needs,men,worthy,of,her,cause,<END>
illyrio,raised,a,hand,<END>
i,know,<END>
sellswords,put,gold,before,honor,',you,are,thinking,<END>
this,man,griff,will,sell,me,to,my,sister,',<END>
not,so,<END>
i,trust,griff,as,i,would,trust,a,brother,<END>
another,mortal,error,<END>
then,i,shall,do,likewise,<END>
the,golden,company,marches,toward,volantis,as,we,speak,there,to,await,the,coming,of,our,queen,out,of,the,east,<END>
beneath,the,gold,the,bitter,steel,<END>
i,had,heard,the,golden,company,was,under,contract,with,one,of,the,free,cities,<END>
myr,<END>
illyrio,smirked,<END>
contracts,can,be,broken,<END>
there,is,more,coin,in,cheese,than,i,knew,said,tyrion,<END>
how,did,you,accomplish,that,<END>
the,magister,waggled,his,fat,fingers,<END>
some,contracts,are,writ,in,ink,and,some,in,blood,<END>
i,say,no,more,<END>
the,dwarf,pondered,that,<END>
the,golden,company,was,reputedly,the,finest,of,the,free,companies,founded,a,century,ago,by,bittersteel,a,bastard,son,of,aegon,the,unworthy,<END>
when,another,of,aegon's,great,bastards,tried,to,seize,the,iron,throne,from,his,trueborn,half-brother,bittersteel,joined,the,revolt,<END>
daemon,blackfyre,had,perished,on,the,redgrass,field,however,and,his,rebellion,with,him,<END>
those,followers,of,the,black,dragon,who,survived,the,battle,yet,refused,to,bend,the,knee,fled,across,the,narrow,sea,among,them,daemon's,younger,sons,bittersteel,and,hundreds,of,landless,lords,and,knights,who,soon,found,themselves,forced,to,sell,their,swords,to,eat,<END>
some,joined,the,ragged,standard,some,the,second,sons,or,maiden's,men,<END>
bittersteel,saw,the,strength,of,house,blackfyre,scattering,to,the,four,winds,so,he,formed,the,golden,company,to,bind,the,exiles,together,<END>
from,that,day,to,this,the,men,of,the,golden,company,had,lived,and,died,in,the,disputed,lands,fighting,for,myr,or,lys,or,tyrosh,in,their,pointless,little,wars,and,dreaming,of,the,land,their,fathers,had,lost,<END>
they,were,exiles,and,sons,of,exiles,dispossessed,and,unforgiven,yet,formidable,fighters,still,<END>
i,admire,your,powers,of,persuasion,tyrion,told,illyrio,<END>
how,did,you,convince,the,golden,company,to,take,up,the,cause,of,our,sweet,queen,when,they,have,spent,so,much,of,their,history,fighting,against,the,targaryens,<END>
illyrio,brushed,away,the,objection,as,if,it,were,a,fly,<END>
black,or,red,a,dragon,is,still,a,dragon,<END>
when,maelys,the,monstrous,died,upon,the,stepstones,it,was,the,end,of,the,male,line,of,house,blackfyre,<END>
the,cheesemonger,smiled,through,his,forked,beard,<END>
and,daenerys,will,give,the,exiles,what,bittersteel,and,the,blackfyres,never,could,<END>
she,will,take,them,home,<END>
with,fire,and,sword,<END>
it,was,the,kind,of,homecoming,that,tyrion,wished,for,as,well,<END>
ten,thousand,swords,makes,for,a,princely,gift,i,grant,you,<END>
her,grace,should,be,most,pleased,<END>
the,magister,gave,a,modest,bob,of,his,head,chins,jiggling,<END>
i,would,never,presume,to,say,what,might,please,her,grace,<END>
prudent,of,you,<END>
tyrion,knew,much,and,more,about,the,gratitude,of,kings,<END>
why,should,queens,be,any,different,<END>
soon,enough,the,magister,was,fast,asleep,leaving,tyrion,to,brood,alone,<END>
he,wondered,what,barristan,selmy,would,think,of,riding,into,battle,with,the,golden,company,<END>
during,the,war,of,the,ninepenny,kings,selmy,had,cut,a,bloody,path,through,their,ranks,to,slay,the,last,of,the,blackfyre,pretenders,<END>
rebellion,makes,for,queer,bedfellows,<END>
and,none,more,queer,than,this,fat,man,and,me,<END>
the,cheesemonger,woke,when,they,stopped,to,change,the,horses,and,sent,for,a,fresh,hamper,<END>
how,far,have,we,come,<END>
the,dwarf,asked,him,as,they,stuffed,themselves,with,cold,capon,and,a,relish,made,of,carrots,raisins,and,bits,of,lime,and,orange,<END>
this,is,andalos,my,friend,<END>
the,land,your,andals,came,from,<END>
they,took,it,from,the,hairy,men,who,were,here,before,them,cousins,to,the,hairy,men,of,ib,<END>
the,heart,of,hugor's,ancient,realm,lies,north,of,us,but,we,are,passing,through,its,southern,marches,<END>
in,pentos,these,are,called,the,flatlands,<END>
farther,east,stand,the,velvet,hills,whence,we,are,bound,<END>
andalos,<END>
the,faith,taught,that,the,seven,themselves,had,once,walked,the,hills,of,andalos,in,human,form,<END>
the,father,reached,his,hand,into,the,heavens,and,pulled,down,seven,stars,tyrion,recited,from,memory,and,one,by,one,he,set,them,on,the,brow,of,hugor,of,the,hill,to,make,a,glowing,crown,<END>
magister,illyrio,gave,him,a,curious,look,<END>
i,did,not,dream,my,little,friend,was,so,devout,<END>
the,dwarf,shrugged,<END>
a,relic,of,my,boyhood,<END>
i,knew,i,would,not,make,a,knight,so,i,decided,to,be,high,septon,<END>
that,crystal,crown,adds,a,foot,to,a,man's,height,<END>
i,studied,the,holy,books,and,prayed,until,i,had,scabs,on,both,my,knees,but,my,quest,came,to,a,tragic,end,<END>
i,reached,that,certain,age,and,fell,in,love,<END>
a,maiden,<END>
i,know,the,way,of,that,<END>
illyrio,thrust,his,right,hand,up,his,left,sleeve,and,drew,out,a,silver,locket,<END>
inside,was,a,painted,likeness,of,a,woman,with,big,blue,eyes,and,pale,golden,hair,streaked,by,silver,<END>
serra,<END>
i,found,her,in,a,lysene,pillow,house,and,brought,her,home,to,warm,my,bed,but,in,the,end,i,wed,her,<END>
me,whose,first,wife,had,been,a,cousin,of,the,prince,of,pentos,<END>
the,palace,gates,were,closed,to,me,thereafter,but,i,did,not,care,<END>
the,price,was,small,enough,for,serra,<END>
how,did,she,die,<END>
tyrion,knew,that,she,was,dead,no,man,spoke,so,fondly,of,a,woman,who,had,abandoned,him,<END>
a,braavosi,trading,galley,called,at,pentos,on,her,way,back,from,the,jade,sea,<END>
the,treasure,carried,cloves,and,saffron,jet,and,jade,scarlet,samite,green,silk,and,the,grey,death,<END>
we,slew,her,oarsmen,as,they,came,ashore,and,burned,the,ship,at,anchor,but,the,rats,crept,down,the,oars,and,paddled,to,the,quay,on,cold,stone,feet,<END>
the,plague,took,two,thousand,before,it,ran,its,course,<END>
magister,illyrio,closed,the,locket,<END>
i,keep,her,hands,in,my,bedchamber,<END>
her,hands,that,were,so,soft,tyrion,thought,of,tysha,<END>
he,glanced,out,at,the,fields,where,once,the,gods,had,walked,<END>
what,sort,of,gods,make,rats,and,plagues,and,dwarfs,<END>
another,passage,from,the,sevenpointed,star,came,back,to,him,<END>
the,maid,brought,him,forth,a,girl,as,supple,as,a,willow,with,eyes,like,deep,blue,pools,and,hugor,declared,that,he,would,have,her,for,his,bride,<END>
so,the,mother,made,her,fertile,and,the,crone,foretold,that,she,would,bear,the,king,fourand-forty,mighty,sons,<END>
the,warrior,gave,strength,to,their,arms,whilst,the,smith,wrought,for,each,a,suit,of,iron,plates,<END>
your,smith,must,have,been,rhoynish,illyrio,quipped,<END>
the,andals,learned,the,art,of,working,iron,from,the,rhoynar,who,dwelt,along,the,river,<END>
this,is,known,<END>
not,by,our,septons,<END>
tyrion,gestured,at,the,fields,<END>
who,dwells,in,these,flatlands,of,yours,<END>
tillers,and,toilers,bound,to,the,land,<END>
there,are,orchards,farms,mines,i,own,some,such,myself,though,i,seldom,visit,them,<END>
why,should,i,spend,my,days,out,here,with,the,myriad,delights,of,pentos,close,at,hand,<END>
myriad,delights,<END>
and,huge,thick,walls,<END>
tyrion,swirled,his,wine,in,his,cup,<END>
we,have,seen,no,towns,since,pentos,<END>
there,are,ruins,<END>
illyrio,waved,a,chicken,leg,toward,the,curtains,<END>
the,horselords,come,this,way,whenever,some,khal,takes,it,into,his,head,to,gaze,upon,the,sea,<END>
the,dothraki,are,not,fond,of,towns,you,will,know,this,even,in,westeros,<END>
fall,upon,one,of,these,khalasars,and,destroy,it,and,you,may,find,that,the,dothraki,are,not,so,quick,to,cross,the,rhoyne,<END>
it,is,cheaper,to,buy,off,foes,with,food,and,gifts,<END>
if,only,i,had,thought,to,bring,a,nice,cheese,to,the,battle,on,the,blackwater,i,might,still,have,all,my,nose,<END>
lord,tywin,had,always,held,the,free,cities,in,contempt,<END>
they,fight,with,coins,instead,of,swords,he,used,to,say,<END>
gold,has,its,uses,but,wars,are,won,with,iron,<END>
give,gold,to,a,foe,and,he,will,just,come,back,for,more,my,father,always,said,<END>
is,this,the,selfsame,father,that,you,murdered,<END>
illyrio,tossed,his,chicken,bone,from,the,litter,<END>
sellswords,will,not,stand,against,dothraki,screamers,<END>
that,was,proved,at,qohor,<END>
not,even,your,brave,griff,<END>
mocked,tyrion,<END>
griff,is,different,<END>
he,has,a,son,he,dotes,on,<END>
young,griff,the,boy,is,called,<END>
there,never,was,a,nobler,lad,<END>
the,wine,the,food,the,sun,the,sway,of,the,litter,the,buzzing,of,the,flies,all,conspired,to,make,tyrion,sleepy,<END>
so,he,slept,woke,drank,<END>
illyrio,matched,him,cup,for,cup,<END>
and,as,the,sky,turned,a,dusky,purple,the,fat,man,began,to,snore,<END>
that,night,tyrion,lannister,dreamed,of,a,battle,that,turned,the,hills,of,westeros,as,red,as,blood,<END>
he,was,in,the,midst,of,it,dealing,death,with,an,axe,as,big,as,he,was,fighting,side,by,side,with,barristan,the,bold,and,bittersteel,as,dragons,wheeled,across,the,sky,above,them,<END>
in,the,dream,he,had,two,heads,both,noseless,<END>
his,father,led,the,enemy,so,he,slew,him,once,again,<END>
then,he,killed,his,brother,jaime,hacking,at,his,face,until,it,was,a,red,ruin,laughing,every,time,he,struck,a,blow,<END>
only,when,the,fight,was,finished,did,he,realize,that,his,second,head,was,weeping,<END>
when,he,woke,his,stunted,legs,were,stiff,as,iron,<END>
illyrio,was,eating,olives,<END>
where,are,we,<END>
tyrion,asked,him,<END>
we,have,not,yet,left,the,flatlands,my,hasty,friend,<END>
soon,our,road,shall,pass,into,the,velvet,hills,<END>
there,we,begin,our,climb,toward,ghoyan,drohe,upon,the,little,rhoyne,<END>
ghoyan,drohe,had,been,a,rhoynar,city,until,the,dragons,of,valyria,had,reduced,it,to,a,smoldering,desolation,<END>
i,am,traveling,through,years,as,well,as,leagues,tyrion,reflected,back,through,history,to,the,days,when,dragons,ruled,the,earth,<END>
tyrion,slept,and,woke,and,slept,again,and,day,and,night,seemed,not,to,matter,<END>
the,velvet,hills,proved,a,disappointment,<END>
half,the,whores,in,lannisport,have,breasts,bigger,than,these,hills,he,told,illyrio,<END>
you,ought,to,call,them,the,velvet,teats,<END>
they,saw,a,circle,of,standing,stones,that,illyrio,claimed,had,been,raised,by,giants,and,later,a,deep,lake,<END>
here,lived,a,den,of,robbers,who,preyed,on,all,who,passed,this,way,illyrio,said,<END>
it,is,said,they,still,dwell,beneath,the,water,<END>
those,who,fish,the,lake,are,pulled,under,and,devoured,<END>
the,next,evening,they,came,upon,a,huge,valyrian,sphinx,crouched,beside,the,road,<END>
it,had,a,dragon's,body,and,a,woman's,face,<END>
a,dragon,queen,said,tyrion,<END>
a,pleasant,omen,<END>
her,king,is,missing,<END>
illyrio,pointed,out,the,smooth,stone,plinth,on,which,the,second,sphinx,once,stood,now,grown,over,with,moss,and,flowering,vines,<END>
the,horselords,built,wooden,wheels,beneath,him,and,dragged,him,back,to,vaes,dothrak,<END>
that,is,an,omen,too,thought,tyrion,but,not,as,hopeful,<END>
that,night,drunker,than,usual,he,broke,into,sudden,song,<END>
he,rode,through,the,streets,of,the,city,down,from,his,hill,on,high,o'er,the,wynds,and,the,steps,and,the,cobbles,he,rode,to,a,woman's,sigh,<END>
for,she,was,his,secret,treasure,she,was,his,shame,and,his,bliss,<END>
and,a,chain,and,a,keep,are,nothing,compared,to,a,woman's,kiss,<END>
those,were,all,the,words,he,knew,aside,from,the,refrain,<END>
hands,of,gold,are,always,cold,but,a,woman's,hands,are,warm,<END>
shae's,hands,had,beat,at,him,as,the,golden,hands,dug,into,her,throat,<END>
he,did,not,remember,if,they'd,been,warm,or,not,<END>
as,the,strength,went,out,of,her,her,blows,became,moths,fluttering,about,his,face,<END>
each,time,he,gave,the,chain,another,twist,the,golden,hands,dug,deeper,<END>
a,chain,and,a,keep,are,nothing,compared,to,a,woman's,kiss,<END>
had,he,kissed,her,one,last,time,after,she,was,dead,<END>
he,could,not,remember,though,he,still,recalled,the,first,time,they,had,kissed,in,his,tent,beside,the,green,fork,<END>
how,sweet,her,mouth,had,tasted,<END>
he,remembered,the,first,time,with,tysha,as,well,<END>
she,did,not,know,how,no,more,than,i,did,<END>
we,kept,bumping,our,noses,but,when,i,touched,her,tongue,with,mine,she,trembled,<END>
tyrion,closed,his,eyes,to,bring,her,face,to,mind,but,instead,he,saw,his,father,squatting,on,a,privy,with,his,bedrobe,hiked,up,about,his,waist,<END>
wherever,whores,go,lord,tywin,said,and,the,crossbow,thrummed,<END>
the,dwarf,rolled,over,pressing,half,a,nose,deep,into,the,silken,pillows,<END>
sleep,opened,beneath,him,like,a,well,and,he,threw,himself,into,it,with,a,will,and,let,the,darkness,eat,him,up,<END>

a,smuggler,quentyn,thought,<END>
that,was,how,the,other,traders,styled,adventure's,master,back,at,the,merchant's,house,<END>
he,is,a,smuggler,and,a,slaver,half,pirate,and,half,pander,but,it,may,be,that,he,is,your,best,hope,the,innkeep,had,told,them,<END>
the,captain,rubbed,thumb,and,forefinger,together,<END>

the,captain,showed,his,teeth,in,something,that,might,have,been,intended,as,a,smile,though,it,gave,his,narrow,face,a,feral,look,<END>

done,<END>
return,an,hour,before,first,light,with,your,friends,and,your,wines,<END>

i,am,pleased,that,i,can,help,you,<END>
we,will,have,a,happy,voyage,yes,<END>
i,am,certain,of,it,said,gerris,<END>
the,captain,called,for,ale,then,and,the,two,of,them,drank,a,toast,to,their,venture,<END>
a,sweet,man,gerris,said,afterward,as,he,and,quentyn,made,their,way,down,to,the,foot,of,the,pier,where,their,hired,hathay,waited,<END>
the,air,hung,hot,and,heavy,and,the,sun,was,so,bright,that,both,of,them,were,squinting,<END>
this,is,a,sweet,city,quentyn,agreed,<END>
sweet,enough,to,rot,your,teeth,<END>
sweet,beets,were,grown,in,profusion,hereabouts,and,were,served,with,almost,every,meal,<END>
the,volantenes,made,a,cold,soup,of,them,as,thick,and,rich,as,purple,honey,<END>
their,wines,were,sweet,as,well,<END>
i,fear,our,happy,voyage,will,be,short,however,<END>
that,sweet,man,does,not,mean,to,take,us,to,meereen,<END>
he,was,too,quick,to,accept,your,offer,<END>
he'll,take,thrice,the,usual,fee,no,doubt,and,once,he,has,us,aboard,and,out,of,sight,of,land,he'll,slit,our,throats,and,take,the,rest,of,our,gold,as,well,<END>

in,westeros,it,might,have,been,called,an,oxcart,though,it,was,a,deal,more,ornate,than,any,cart,that,quentyn,had,ever,seen,in,dorne,and,lacked,an,ox,<END>
the,hathay,was,pulled,by,a,dwarf,elephant,her,hide,the,color,of,dirty,snow,<END>
the,streets,of,old,volantis,were,full,of,such,<END>
quentyn,would,have,preferred,to,walk,but,they,were,miles,from,their,inn,<END>
besides,the,innkeep,at,the,merchant's,house,had,warned,him,that,traveling,afoot,would,taint,them,in,the,eyes,of,foreign,captains,and,the,native-born,volantenes,alike,<END>
persons,of,quality,traveled,by,palanquin,or,in,the,back,of,a,hathay,and,as,it,happened,the,innkeep,had,a,cousin,who,owned,several,such,contrivances,and,would,be,pleased,to,serve,them,in,this,matter,<END>
their,driver,was,one,of,the,cousin's,slaves,a,small,man,with,a,wheel,tattooed,upon,one,cheek,naked,but,for,a,breechclout,and,a,pair,of,sandals,<END>
his,skin,was,the,color,of,teak,his,eyes,chips,of,flint,<END>
after,he,had,helped,them,up,onto,the,cushioned,bench,between,the,cart's,two,huge,wooden,wheels,he,clambered,onto,the,elephant's,back,<END>
the,merchant's,house,quentyn,told,him,but,go,along,the,wharves,<END>
beyond,the,waterfront,and,its,breezes,the,streets,and,alleys,of,volantis,were,hot,enough,to,drown,a,man,in,his,own,sweat,at,least,on,this,side,of,the,river,<END>
the,driver,shouted,something,at,his,elephant,in,the,local,tongue,<END>
the,beast,began,to,move,trunk,swaying,from,side,to,side,<END>
the,cart,lurched,along,behind,her,the,driver,hooting,at,sailors,and,slaves,alike,to,clear,the,way,<END>
it,was,easy,enough,to,tell,one,from,the,other,<END>
the,slaves,were,all,tattooed,a,mask,of,blue,feathers,a,lightning,bolt,that,ran,from,jaw,to,brow,a,coin,upon,the,cheek,a,leopard's,spots,a,skull,a,jug,<END>

one,of,the,corpses,was,so,fat,that,the,ship's,cook,had,to,cut,his,fingers,off,with,a,meat,cleaver,to,claim,his,rings,<END>
it,took,three,meadowlarks,to,roll,the,body,into,the,sea,<END>
the,other,pirates,were,chucked,in,after,him,without,a,word,of,prayer,or,ceremony,<END>
their,own,dead,received,more,tender,treatment,<END>
the,sailors,sewed,their,bodies,up,in,canvas,weighed,down,with,ballast,stones,so,they,might,sink,more,quickly,<END>
the,captain,of,the,meadowlark,led,his,crew,in,a,prayer,for,the,souls,of,their,slain,shipmates,<END>

one,of,you,should,say,some,words,for,your,dead,before,we,give,them,to,the,sea,the,captain,said,<END>
gerris,had,obliged,lying,with,every,other,word,since,he,dare,not,tell,the,truth,of,who,they'd,been,or,why,they'd,come,<END>
it,was,not,supposed,to,end,like,that,for,them,<END>
this,will,be,a,tale,to,tell,our,grandchildren,cletus,had,declared,the,day,they,set,out,from,his,father's,castle,<END>

later,in,the,planky,town,the,dornishmen,had,toasted,quentyn's,future,bride,made,ribald,japes,about,his,wedding,night,to,come,and,talked,about,the,things,they'd,see,the,deeds,they'd,do,the,glory,they,would,win,<END>
all,they,won,was,a,sailcloth,sack,filled,with,ballast,stones,<END>

one,of,them,had,given,him,his,first,kiss,though,he,never,knew,which,one,<END>
as,daughters,of,a,landed,knight,the,twins,were,too,lowborn,to,marry,but,cletus,did,not,think,that,was,any,reason,to,stop,kissing,them,<END>
after,you're,wed,you,can,take,one,of,them,for,a,paramour,<END>
or,both,why,not,<END>
but,quentyn,thought,of,several,reasons,why,not,so,he,had,done,his,best,to,avoid,the,twins,thereafter,and,there,had,been,no,second,kiss,<END>
more,recently,the,youngest,of,lord,yronwood's,daughters,had,taken,to,following,him,about,the,castle,<END>
gwyneth,was,but,twelve,a,small,scrawny,girl,whose,dark,eyes,and,brown,hair,set,her,apart,in,that,house,of,blue-eyed,blondes,<END>

that,was,before,prince,doran,had,summoned,him,to,the,water,gardens,<END>

i,never,asked,for,this,he,thought,<END>
across,the,wide,blue,expanse,of,the,rhoyne,he,could,see,the,black,wall,that,had,been,raised,by,the,valyrians,when,volantis,was,no,more,than,an,outpost,of,their,empire,a,great,oval,of,fused,stone,two,hundred,feet,high,and,so,thick,that,six,four-horse,chariots,could,race,around,its,top,abreast,as,they,did,each,year,to,celebrate,the,founding,of,the,city,<END>
outlanders,foreigners,and,freedmen,were,not,allowed,inside,the,black,wall,save,at,the,invitation,of,those,who,dwelt,within,scions,of,the,old,blood,who,could,trace,their,ancestry,back,to,valyria,itself,<END>
the,traffic,was,thicker,here,<END>
they,were,near,the,western,end,of,the,long,bridge,which,linked,the,two,halves,of,the,city,<END>
wayns,and,carts,and,hathays,crowded,the,streets,all,of,them,coming,from,the,bridge,or,making,for,it,<END>

not,far,from,fishermonger's,square,and,the,merchant's,house,shouts,erupted,from,a,cross,street,and,a,dozen,unsullied,spearmen,in,ornate,armor,and,tiger-skin,cloaks,appeared,as,if,from,nowhere,waving,everyone,aside,so,the,triarch,could,pass,through,atop,his,elephant,<END>
the,triarch's,elephant,was,a,grey-skinned,behemoth,clad,in,elaborate,enameled,armor,that,clattered,softly,as,he,moved,the,castle,on,its,back,so,tall,that,it,scraped,the,top,of,the,ornamental,stone,arch,he,was,passing,underneath,<END>
the,triarchs,are,considered,so,elevated,that,their,feet,are,not,allowed,to,touch,the,ground,during,their,year,of,service,quentyn,informed,his,companion,<END>

blocking,up,the,streets,and,leaving,heaps,of,dung,for,the,likes,of,us,to,contend,with,said,gerris,<END>

it,had,no,pictures,<END>

maps,do,not,count,<END>
if,he,had,told,me,it,was,about,tigers,and,elephants,i,might,have,given,it,a,try,<END>
it,looked,suspiciously,like,a,history,<END>
when,their,hathay,reached,the,edge,of,the,fishermonger's,square,their,elephant,lifted,her,trunk,and,made,a,honking,noise,like,some,huge,white,goose,reluctant,to,plunge,into,the,tangle,of,wayns,palanquins,and,foot,traffic,ahead,<END>
their,driver,prodded,her,with,his,heel,and,kept,her,moving,<END>

quentyn,understood,one,word,in,two,at,best,but,he,did,not,need,to,know,the,words,to,know,the,fish,<END>

the,little,men,were,done,up,in,wooden,armor,miniature,knights,preparing,for,a,joust,<END>

some,childhood,malady,had,made,all,his,hair,fall,out,<END>

a,ship,corrected,quentyn,<END>

i,will,see,her,<END>

you,don't,need,to,take,a,knee,for,me,<END>
that's,just,for,kings,<END>
though,a,wife,and,mother,gilly,still,seemed,half,a,child,to,him,a,slender,little,thing,wrapped,up,in,one,of,sam's,old,cloaks,<END>
the,cloak,was,so,big,on,her,that,she,could,have,hidden,several,other,girls,beneath,its,folds,<END>

val,begged,the,king,to,spare,him,<END>
she,said,she'd,let,some,kneeler,marry,her,and,never,slit,his,throat,if,only,mance,could,live,<END>

and,the,really,old,books,either,they,have,crumbled,all,away,or,they,are,buried,somewhere,that,i,haven't,looked,yet,or,well,it,could,be,that,there,are,no,such,books,and,never,were,<END>
the,oldest,histories,we,have,were,written,after,the,andals,came,to,westeros,<END>
the,first,men,only,left,us,runes,on,rocks,so,everything,we,think,we,know,about,the,age,of,heroes,and,the,dawn,age,and,the,long,night,comes,from,accounts,set,down,by,septons,thousands,of,years,later,<END>
there,are,archmaesters,at,the,citadel,who,question,all,of,it,<END>
those,old,histories,are,full,of,kings,who,reigned,for,hundreds,of,years,and,knights,riding,around,a,thousand,years,before,there,were,knights,<END>
you,know,the,tales,brandon,the,builder,symeon,star-eyes,night's,king,we,say,that,you're,the,nine-hundred-and-ninety-eighth,lord,commander,of,the,night's,watch,but,the,oldest,list,i've,found,shows,six,hundred,seventy-four,commanders,which,suggests,that,it,was,written,during,long,ago,jon,broke,in,<END>
what,about,the,others,<END>
i,found,mention,of,dragonglass,<END>
the,children,of,the,forest,used,to,give,the,night's,watch,a,hundred,obsidian,daggers,every,year,during,the,age,of,heroes,<END>

the,one,that,killed,small,paul,was,riding,a,dead,horse,so,that,part's,plainly,true,<END>

men,who,fall,in,battle,against,the,others,must,be,burned,or,else,the,dead,will,rise,again,as,their,thralls,<END>
we,knew,all,this,<END>
the,question,is,how,do,we,fight,them,<END>
the,armor,of,the,others,is,proof,against,most,ordinary,blades,if,the,tales,can,be,believed,and,their,own,swords,are,so,cold,they,shatter,steel,<END>
fire,will,dismay,them,though,and,they,are,vulnerable,to,obsidian,<END>

dragonsteel,<END>

this,time,duck,laughed,and,haldon,said,what,a,droll,little,fellow,you,are,yollo,<END>
they,say,that,the,shrouded,lord,will,grant,a,boon,to,any,man,who,can,make,him,laugh,<END>

his,grey,kiss,<END>
the,thought,made,his,flesh,crawl,<END>
death,had,lost,its,terror,for,tyrion,lannister,but,greyscale,was,another,matter,<END>
the,shrouded,lord,is,just,a,legend,he,told,himself,no,more,real,than,the,ghost,of,lann,the,clever,that,some,claim,haunts,casterly,rock,<END>
even,so,he,held,his,tongue,<END>
the,dwarf's,sudden,silence,went,unnoticed,as,duck,had,begun,to,regale,him,with,his,own,life,story,<END>
his,father,had,been,an,armorer,at,bitterbridge,he,said,so,he,had,been,born,with,the,sound,of,steel,ringing,in,his,ears,and,had,taken,to,swordplay,at,an,early,age,<END>
such,a,large,and,likely,lad,drew,the,eye,of,old,lord,caswell,who,offered,him,a,place,in,his,garrison,but,the,boy,had,wanted,more,<END>
he,watched,caswell's,weakling,son,named,a,page,a,squire,and,finally,a,knight,<END>
a,weedy,pinch-faced,sneak,he,was,but,the,old,lord,had,four,daughters,and,only,the,one,son,so,no,one,was,allowed,to,say,a,word,against,him,<END>
t'other,squires,hardly,dared,to,lay,a,finger,on,him,in,the,yard,<END>
you,were,not,so,timid,though,<END>
tyrion,could,see,where,this,tale,was,going,easily,enough,<END>
my,father,made,a,longsword,for,me,to,mark,my,sixteenth,nameday,said,duck,but,lorent,liked,the,look,of,it,so,much,he,took,it,for,himself,and,my,bloody,father,never,dared,to,tell,him,no,<END>
when,i,complained,lorent,told,me,to,my,face,that,my,hand,was,made,to,hold,a,hammer,not,a,sword,<END>
so,i,went,and,got,a,hammer,and,beat,him,with,it,till,both,his,arms,and,half,his,ribs,were,broken,<END>
after,that,i,had,to,leave,the,reach,quick,as,it,were,<END>
i,made,it,across,the,water,to,the,golden,company,<END>
i,did,some,smithing,for,a,few,years,as,a,'prentice,then,ser,harry,strickland,took,me,on,as,squire,<END>
when,griff,sent,word,downriver,that,he,needed,someone,to,help,train,his,son,to,arms,harry,sent,him,me,<END>

a,year,later,<END>
haldon,halfmaester,smiled,a,thin,smile,<END>
tell,our,little,friend,how,you,came,by,your,name,why,don't,you,<END>
a,knight,needs,more,than,just,the,one,name,the,big,man,insisted,and,well,we,were,in,a,field,when,he,dubbed,me,and,i,looked,up,and,saw,these,ducks,so,don't,laugh,now,<END>
just,after,sunset,they,left,the,road,to,rest,in,an,overgrown,yard,beside,an,old,stone,well,<END>
tyrion,hopped,down,to,work,the,cramps,out,of,his,calves,whilst,duck,and,haldon,were,watering,the,horses,<END>
tough,brown,grass,and,weed,trees,sprouted,from,the,gaps,between,the,cobbles,and,the,mossy,walls,of,what,once,might,have,been,a,huge,stone,manse,<END>
after,the,animals,had,been,tended,to,the,riders,shared,a,simple,supper,of,salt,pork,and,cold,white,beans,washed,down,with,ale,<END>
tyrion,found,the,plain,fare,a,pleasant,change,from,all,the,rich,food,he,had,eaten,with,illyrio,<END>
those,chests,we,brought,you,he,said,as,they,were,chewing,<END>
gold,for,the,golden,company,i,thought,at,first,until,i,saw,ser,rolly,hoist,a,chest,onto,one,shoulder,<END>
if,it,were,full,of,coin,he,could,never,have,lifted,it,so,easily,<END>
it's,just,armor,said,duck,with,a,shrug,<END>
clothing,as,well,haldon,broke,in,<END>
court,clothes,for,all,our,party,<END>
fine,woolens,velvets,silken,cloaks,<END>
one,does,not,come,before,a,queen,looking,shabby,nor,emptyhanded,<END>
the,magister,has,been,kind,enough,to,provide,us,with,suitable,gifts,<END>
come,moonrise,they,were,back,in,their,saddles,trotting,eastward,under,a,mantle,of,stars,<END>
the,old,valyrian,road,glimmered,ahead,of,them,like,a,long,silver,ribbon,winding,through,wood,and,dale,<END>
for,a,little,while,tyrion,lannister,felt,almost,at,peace,<END>
lomas,longstrider,told,it,true,<END>
the,road's,a,wonder,<END>
lomas,longstrider,<END>
asked,duck,<END>
a,scribe,long,dead,said,haldon,<END>
he,spent,his,life,traveling,the,world,and,writing,about,the,lands,he,visited,in,two,books,he,called,wonders,and,wonders,made,by,man,<END>
an,uncle,of,mine,gave,them,to,me,when,i,was,just,a,boy,said,tyrion,<END>
i,read,them,until,they,fell,to,pieces,<END>
the,gods,made,seven,wonders,and,mortal,man,made,nine,quoted,the,halfmaester,<END>
rather,impious,of,mortal,man,to,do,the,gods,two,better,but,there,you,are,<END>
the,stone,roads,of,valyria,were,one,of,longstrider's,nine,<END>
the,fifth,i,believe,<END>
the,fourth,said,tyrion,who,had,committed,all,sixteen,of,the,wonders,to,memory,as,a,boy,<END>
his,uncle,gerion,liked,to,set,him,on,the,table,during,feasts,and,make,him,recite,them,<END>
i,liked,that,well,enough,didn't,i,<END>
standing,there,amongst,the,trenchers,with,every,eye,upon,me,proving,what,a,clever,little,imp,i,was,<END>
for,years,afterward,he,had,cherished,a,dream,that,one,day,he,would,travel,the,world,and,see,longstrider's,wonders,for,himself,<END>
lord,tywin,had,put,an,end,to,that,hope,ten,days,before,his,dwarf,son's,sixteenth,nameday,when,tyrion,asked,to,tour,the,nine,free,cities,as,his,uncles,had,done,at,that,same,age,<END>
my,brothers,could,be,relied,upon,to,bring,no,shame,upon,house,lannister,his,father,had,replied,<END>
neither,ever,wed,a,whore,<END>
and,when,tyrion,had,reminded,him,that,in,ten,days,he,would,be,a,man,grown,free,to,travel,where,he,wished,lord,tywin,had,said,no,man,is,free,<END>
only,children,and,fools,think,elsewise,<END>
go,by,all,means,<END>
wear,motley,and,stand,upon,your,head,to,amuse,the,spice,lords,and,the,cheese,kings,<END>
just,see,that,you,pay,your,own,way,and,put,aside,any,thoughts,of,returning,<END>
at,that,the,boy's,defiance,had,crumbled,<END>
if,it,is,useful,occupation,you,require,useful,occupation,you,shall,have,his,father,then,said,<END>
so,to,mark,his,manhood,tyrion,was,given,charge,of,all,the,drains,and,cisterns,within,casterly,rock,<END>
perhaps,he,hoped,i'd,fall,into,one,<END>
but,tywin,had,been,disappointed,in,that,<END>
the,drains,never,drained,half,so,well,as,when,he,had,charge,of,them,<END>
i,need,a,cup,of,wine,to,wash,the,taste,of,tywin,from,my,mouth,<END>
a,skin,of,wine,would,serve,me,even,better,<END>
they,rode,all,night,with,tyrion,sleeping,fitfully,dozing,against,the,pommel,and,waking,suddenly,<END>
from,time,to,time,he,would,begin,to,slip,sideways,from,the,saddle,but,ser,rolly,would,get,a,hand,on,him,and,yank,him,upright,once,again,<END>
by,dawn,the,dwarf's,legs,were,aching,and,his,cheeks,were,chafed,and,raw,<END>
it,was,the,next,day,before,they,reached,the,site,of,ghoyan,drohe,hard,beside,the,river,<END>
the,fabled,rhoyne,said,tyrion,when,he,glimpsed,the,slow,green,waterway,from,atop,a,rise,<END>
the,little,rhoyne,said,duck,<END>
it,is,that,<END>
a,pleasant,enough,river,i,suppose,but,the,smallest,fork,of,the,trident,is,twice,as,wide,and,all,three,of,them,run,swifter,<END>
the,city,was,no,more,impressive,<END>
ghoyan,drohe,had,never,been,large,tyrion,recalled,from,his,histories,but,it,had,been,a,fair,place,green,and,flowering,a,city,of,canals,and,fountains,<END>
until,the,war,<END>
until,the,dragons,came,<END>
a,thousand,years,later,the,canals,were,choked,with,reeds,and,mud,and,pools,of,stagnant,water,gave,birth,to,swarms,of,flies,<END>
the,broken,stones,of,temples,and,palaces,were,sinking,back,into,the,earth,and,gnarled,old,willows,grew,thick,along,the,riverbanks,<END>
a,few,people,still,remained,amidst,the,squalor,tending,little,gardens,in,amongst,the,weeds,<END>
the,sound,of,iron,hooves,ringing,on,the,old,valyrian,road,sent,most,of,them,darting,back,into,the,holes,they'd,crawled,from,but,the,bolder,ones,lingered,in,the,sun,long,enough,to,stare,at,the,passing,riders,with,dull,incurious,eyes,<END>
one,naked,girl,with,mud,up,to,her,knees,could,not,seem,to,take,her,eyes,off,tyrion,<END>
she,has,never,seen,a,dwarf,before,he,realized,much,less,a,dwarf,without,a,nose,<END>
he,made,a,face,and,stuck,his,tongue,out,and,the,girl,began,to,cry,<END>
what,did,you,do,to,her,<END>
duck,asked,<END>
i,blew,her,a,kiss,<END>
all,the,girls,cry,when,i,kiss,them,<END>
beyond,the,tangled,willows,the,road,ended,abruptly,and,they,turned,north,for,a,short,ways,and,rode,beside,the,water,until,the,brush,gave,way,and,they,found,themselves,beside,an,old,stone,quay,half-submerged,and,surrounded,by,tall,brown,weeds,<END>
duck,<END>
came,a,shout,<END>
haldon,<END>
tyrion,craned,his,head,to,one,side,and,saw,a,boy,standing,on,the,roof,of,a,low,wooden,building,waving,a,wide-brimmed,straw,hat,<END>
he,was,a,lithe,and,well-made,youth,with,a,lanky,build,and,a,shock,of,dark,blue,hair,<END>
the,dwarf,put,his,age,at,fifteen,sixteen,or,near,enough,to,make,no,matter,<END>
the,roof,the,boy,was,standing,on,turned,out,to,be,the,cabin,of,the,shy,maid,an,old,ramshackle,single-masted,poleboat,<END>
she,had,a,broad,beam,and,a,shallow,draft,ideal,for,making,her,way,up,the,smallest,of,streams,and,crabwalking,over,sandbars,<END>
a,homely,maid,thought,tyrion,but,sometimes,the,ugliest,ones,are,the,hungriest,once,abed,<END>
the,poleboats,that,plied,the,rivers,of,dorne,were,often,brightly,painted,and,exquisitely,carved,but,not,this,maid,<END>
her,paintwork,was,a,muddy,greyish,brown,mottled,and,flaking,her,big,curved,tiller,plain,and,unadorned,<END>
she,looks,like,dirt,he,thought,but,no,doubt,that's,the,point,<END>

a,dwarf,<END>
what's,this,<END>
i,know,you,were,hoping,for,a,wheel,of,cheese,<END>
tyrion,turned,to,young,griff,and,gave,the,lad,his,most,disarming,smile,<END>

this,one,<END>
tyrion,held,it,up,for,griff,to,admire,<END>

why,does,he,imagine,that,her,grace,would,welcome,the,service,of,a,self-confessed,kingslayer,and,betrayer,<END>
a,fair,question,thought,tyrion,but,what,he,said,was,the,king,i,slew,was,sitting,on,her,throne,and,all,those,i,betrayed,were,lions,so,it,seems,to,me,that,i,have,already,done,the,queen,good,service,<END>

there,is,blood,between,targaryen,and,lannister,<END>
why,would,you,support,the,cause,of,queen,daenerys,<END>

oh,and,hate,<END>
if,you,had,ever,met,my,sister,you,would,understand,<END>

he,has,supped,on,hate,himself,this,one,<END>
it,has,warmed,him,in,the,night,for,years,<END>

i,am,no,knight,<END>
not,only,a,liar,but,a,bad,one,<END>

what,if,we,should,find,the,queen,and,discover,that,this,talk,of,dragons,was,just,some,sailor's,drunken,fancy,<END>
this,wide,world,is,full,of,such,mad,tales,<END>

davos,<END>
lightning,split,the,northern,sky,etching,the,black,tower,of,the,night,lamp,against,the,blue-white,sky,<END>
six,heartbeats,later,came,the,thunder,like,a,distant,drum,<END>
the,guards,marched,davos,seaworth,across,a,bridge,of,black,basalt,and,under,an,iron,portcullis,showing,signs,of,rust,<END>
beyond,lay,a,deep,salt,moat,and,a,drawbridge,supported,by,a,pair,of,massive,chains,<END>
green,waters,surged,below,sending,up,plumes,of,spray,to,smash,against,the,foundations,of,the,castle,<END>
then,came,a,second,gatehouse,larger,than,the,first,its,stones,bearded,with,green,algae,<END>
davos,stumbled,across,a,muddy,yard,with,his,hands,bound,at,the,wrists,<END>
a,cold,rain,stung,his,eyes,<END>
the,guards,prodded,him,up,the,steps,into,breakwater's,cavernous,stone,keep,<END>
once,inside,the,captain,removed,his,cloak,and,hung,it,from,a,peg,so,as,not,to,leave,puddles,on,the,threadbare,myrish,carpet,<END>
davos,did,the,same,fumbling,at,the,clasp,with,his,bound,hands,<END>
he,had,not,forgotten,the,courtesies,he,had,learned,on,dragonstone,during,his,years,of,service,<END>
they,found,the,lord,alone,in,the,gloom,of,his,hall,making,a,supper,of,beer,and,bread,and,sister's,stew,<END>
twenty,iron,sconces,were,mounted,along,his,thick,stone,walls,but,only,four,held,torches,and,none,of,them,was,lit,<END>
two,fat,tallow,candles,gave,a,meagre,flickering,light,<END>
davos,could,hear,the,rain,lashing,at,the,walls,and,a,steady,dripping,where,the,roof,had,sprung,a,leak,<END>
m'lord,said,the,captain,we,found,this,man,in,the,belly,o',the,whale,trying,to,buy,his,way,off,island,<END>
he,had,twelve,dragons,on,him,and,this,thing,too,<END>
the,captain,put,it,on,the,table,by,the,lord,a,wide,ribbon,of,black,velvet,trimmed,with,cloth-of-gold,and,bearing,three,seals,a,crowned,stag,stamped,in,golden,beeswax,a,flaming,heart,in,red,a,hand,in,white,<END>
davos,waited,wet,and,dripping,his,wrists,chafing,where,the,wet,rope,dug,into,his,skin,<END>
one,word,from,this,lord,and,he,would,soon,be,hanging,from,the,gallows,gate,of,sisterton,but,at,least,he,was,out,of,the,rain,with,solid,stone,beneath,his,feet,in,place,of,a,heaving,deck,<END>
he,was,soaked,and,sore,and,haggard,worn,thin,by,grief,and,betrayal,and,sick,to,death,of,storms,<END>
the,lord,wiped,his,mouth,with,the,back,of,his,hand,and,picked,up,the,ribbon,for,a,closer,squint,<END>
lightning,flashed,outside,making,the,arrow,loops,blaze,blue,and,white,for,half,a,heartbeat,<END>
one,two,three,four,davos,counted,before,the,thunder,came,<END>
when,it,quieted,he,listened,to,the,dripping,and,the,duller,roar,beneath,his,feet,where,the,waves,were,smashing,against,breakwater's,huge,stone,arches,and,swirling,through,its,dungeons,<END>
he,might,well,end,up,down,there,fettered,to,a,wet,stone,floor,and,left,to,drown,when,the,tide,came,rushing,in,<END>
no,he,tried,to,tell,himself,a,smuggler,might,die,that,way,but,not,a,king's,hand,<END>
i'm,worth,more,if,he,sells,me,to,his,queen,<END>
the,lord,fingered,the,ribbon,frowning,at,the,seals,<END>
he,was,an,ugly,man,big,and,fleshy,with,an,oarsman's,thick,shoulders,and,no,neck,<END>
coarse,grey,stubble,going,white,in,patches,covered,his,cheeks,and,chin,<END>
above,a,massive,shelf,of,brow,he,was,bald,<END>
his,nose,was,lumpy,and,red,with,broken,veins,his,lips,thick,and,he,had,a,sort,of,webbing,between,the,three,middle,fingers,of,his,right,hand,<END>
davos,had,heard,that,some,of,the,lords,of,the,three,sisters,had,webbed,hands,and,feet,but,he,had,always,put,that,down,as,just,another,sailor's,story,<END>
the,lord,leaned,back,<END>
cut,him,free,he,said,and,peel,those,gloves,off,him,<END>
i,want,to,see,his,hands,<END>
the,captain,did,as,he,was,told,<END>
as,he,jerked,up,his,captive's,maimed,left,hand,the,lightning,flashed,again,throwing,the,shadow,of,davos,seaworth's,shortened,fingers,across,the,blunt,and,brutal,face,of,godric,borrell,lord,of,sweetsister,<END>

you,are,the,onion,knight,<END>
i,have,been,called,that,my,lord,<END>
davos,was,a,lord,himself,and,had,been,a,knight,for,long,years,now,but,deep,down,he,was,still,what,he,had,always,been,a,smuggler,of,common,birth,who,had,bought,his,knighthood,with,a,hold,of,onions,and,salt,fish,<END>

it,was,a,vile,town,a,sty,small,and,mean,and,rank,with,the,odors,of,pig,shit,and,rotting,fish,<END>
davos,remembered,it,well,from,his,smuggling,days,<END>
the,three,sisters,had,been,a,favorite,haunt,of,smugglers,for,hundreds,of,years,and,a,pirate's,nest,before,that,<END>
sisterton's,streets,were,mud,and,planks,its,houses,daub-and-wattle,hovels,roofed,with,straw,and,by,the,gallows,gate,there,were,always,hanged,men,with,their,entrails,dangling,out,<END>

a,king's,command,and,a,friend's,betrayal,davos,might,have,said,<END>

the,freys,killed,lord,wyman's,son,we,heard,<END>

instead,they,caught,me,at,the,river,gate,<END>
the,gold,cloaks,who,had,pursued,me,from,the,castle,shouted,for,those,at,the,gate,to,stop,me,so,they,crossed,their,spears,to,bar,my,way,<END>

the,other,broke,off,once,i,was,through,the,gate,so,i,spurred,my,horse,to,a,gallop,and,rode,hellbent,along,the,river,until,the,city,was,lost,to,sight,behind,me,<END>
that,night,i,traded,my,horse,for,a,handful,of,pennies,and,some,rags,and,the,next,morning,i,joined,the,stream,of,smallfolk,making,their,way,to,king's,landing,<END>
i'd,gone,out,the,mud,gate,so,i,returned,through,the,gate,of,the,gods,with,dirt,on,my,face,stubble,on,my,cheeks,and,no,weapon,but,a,wooden,staff,<END>
in,roughspun,clothes,and,mud-caked,boots,i,was,just,one,more,old,man,fleeing,the,war,<END>

a,flicker,of,disapproval,crossed,the,old,man's,face,but,it,was,not,his,way,to,question,his,queen,<END>

the,only,sound,was,the,soft,scruff,of,their,feet,upon,the,steps,<END>
at,ground,level,the,great,pyramid,of,meereen,was,a,hushed,place,full,of,dust,and,shadows,<END>

his,skin,was,pink,and,blotchy,his,nose,broad,his,mouth,small,his,hair,long,and,dark,and,dry,<END>

oh,he's,been,skinned,here,and,there,said,ramsay,<END>

reek,had,been,whipped,and,racked,and,cut,but,there,was,no,pain,half,so,excruciating,as,the,pain,that,followed,flaying,<END>
it,was,the,sort,of,pain,that,drove,men,mad,and,it,could,not,be,endured,for,long,<END>
soon,or,late,the,victim,would,scream,please,no,more,no,more,stop,it,hurting,cut,it,off,and,lord,ramsay,would,oblige,<END>

she,was,past,forty,more,handsome,than,pretty,but,still,easy,on,the,eye,<END>

the,septa,asked,him,wringing,water,from,her,hair,<END>
the,big,ridgeback,<END>
the,early,morning,was,the,best,time,for,seeing,turtles,<END>
during,the,day,they,would,swim,down,deep,or,hide,in,cuts,along,the,banks,but,when,the,sun,was,newly,risen,they,came,to,the,surface,<END>

some,might,be,prettier,than,others,but,every,one,was,full,of,promise,<END>
the,turtles,have,their,charms,i,will,allow,<END>
nothing,delights,me,so,much,as,the,sight,of,a,nice,pair,of,shapely,shells,<END>

yandry,pulled,up,the,anchor,slid,one,of,the,long,poles,off,the,cabin,roof,and,pushed,them,off,<END>

yandry,went,to,the,tiller,<END>
ysilla,was,turning,the,biscuits,<END>
she,laid,an,iron,pan,atop,the,brazier,and,put,the,bacon,in,<END>
some,days,she,cooked,biscuits,and,bacon,some,days,bacon,and,biscuits,<END>
once,every,fortnight,there,might,be,a,fish,but,not,today,<END>
when,ysilla,turned,her,back,tyrion,snatched,a,biscuit,off,the,brazier,darting,away,just,in,time,to,avoid,a,smack,from,her,fearsome,wooden,spoon,<END>
they,were,best,when,eaten,hot,dripping,with,honey,and,butter,<END>
the,smell,of,the,bacon,cooking,soon,fetched,duck,up,from,the,hold,<END>
he,sniffed,over,the,brazier,received,a,swack,from,ysilla's,spoon,and,went,back,to,have,his,morning,piss,off,the,stern,<END>
tyrion,waddled,over,to,join,him,<END>
now,here's,a,sight,to,see,he,quipped,as,they,were,emptying,their,bladders,a,dwarf,and,a,duck,making,the,mighty,rhoyne,that,much,mightier,<END>
yandry,snorted,in,derision,<END>

young,griff,stumbled,up,onto,deck,yawning,<END>
good,morrow,all,<END>
the,lad,was,shorter,than,duck,but,his,lanky,build,suggested,that,he,had,not,yet,come,into,his,full,growth,<END>
this,beardless,boy,could,have,any,maiden,in,the,seven,kingdoms,blue,hair,or,no,<END>
those,eyes,of,his,would,melt,them,<END>

by,lamplight,they,turned,black,and,in,the,light,of,dusk,they,seemed,purple,<END>

tyrion,pulled,apart,two,biscuits,filled,them,with,bacon,and,carried,one,to,yandry,at,the,tiller,<END>
afterward,he,helped,duck,to,raise,the,shy,maid's,big,lateen,sail,<END>
yandry,took,them,out,into,the,center,of,the,river,where,the,current,was,strongest,<END>
the,shy,maid,was,a,sweet,boat,<END>
her,draft,was,so,shallow,she,could,work,her,way,up,even,the,smallest,of,the,river's,vassal,streams,negotiating,sandbars,that,would,have,stranded,larger,vessels,yet,with,her,sail,raised,and,a,current,under,her,she,could,make,good,speed,<END>
that,could,mean,life,and,death,on,the,upper,reaches,of,the,rhoyne,yandry,claimed,<END>
there,is,no,law,above,the,sorrows,not,for,a,thousand,years,<END>
and,no,people,so,far,as,i,can,see,<END>
he'd,glimpsed,some,ruins,along,the,banks,piles,of,masonry,overgrown,by,vines,and,moss,and,flowers,but,no,other,signs,of,human,habitation,<END>
you,do,not,know,the,river,yollo,<END>
a,pirate,boat,may,lurk,up,any,stream,and,escaped,slaves,oft,hide,amongst,the,ruins,<END>
the,slave-catchers,seldom,come,so,far,north,<END>
slave-catchers,would,be,a,welcome,change,from,turtles,<END>
not,being,an,escaped,slave,tyrion,need,not,fear,being,caught,<END>

the,valuable,goods,came,up,the,river,from,volantis,<END>

swords,today,i,think,<END>

young,griff,grinned,<END>
swords,will,be,sweet,<END>
tyrion,helped,him,dress,for,the,bout,in,heavy,breeches,padded,doublet,and,a,dinted,suit,of,old,steel,plate,<END>

neither,man,had,taken,up,a,shield,this,morning,so,it,was,a,game,of,slash,and,parry,back,and,forth,across,the,deck,<END>
the,river,rang,to,the,sounds,of,their,combat,<END>
young,griff,landed,more,blows,though,duck's,were,harder,<END>
after,a,while,the,bigger,man,began,to,tire,<END>
his,cuts,came,a,little,slower,a,little,lower,<END>
young,griff,turned,them,all,and,launched,a,furious,attack,that,forced,ser,rolly,back,<END>
when,they,reached,the,stern,the,lad,tied,up,their,blades,and,slammed,a,shoulder,into,duck,and,the,big,man,went,into,the,river,<END>
he,came,up,sputtering,and,cursing,bellowing,for,someone,to,fish,him,out,before,a,'snapper,ate,his,privates,<END>
tyrion,tossed,a,line,to,him,<END>
ducks,should,swim,better,than,that,he,said,as,he,and,yandry,were,hauling,the,knight,back,aboard,the,shy,maid,<END>

let,us,see,how,dwarfs,swim,he,said,chucking,him,headlong,into,the,rhoyne,<END>
the,dwarf,laughed,last,he,could,paddle,passably,well,and,did,until,his,legs,began,to,cramp,<END>
young,griff,extended,him,a,pole,<END>
you,are,not,the,first,to,try,and,drown,me,he,told,duck,as,he,was,pouring,river,water,from,his,boot,<END>
my,father,threw,me,down,a,well,the,day,i,was,born,but,i,was,so,ugly,that,the,water,witch,who,lived,down,there,spat,me,back,<END>

his,uncle,had,taught,him,a,bit,of,tumbling,when,he,was,six,or,seven,<END>

for,half,a,year,he,cartwheeled,his,merry,way,about,casterly,rock,bringing,smiles,to,the,faces,of,septons,squires,and,servants,alike,<END>

the,task,was,a,formidable,one,but,the,dwarf,labored,at,it,every,day,scratching,away,as,best,he,could,as,he,sat,cross-legged,on,the,cabin,roof,<END>
tyrion,had,read,much,and,more,of,dragons,through,the,years,<END>
the,greater,part,of,those,accounts,were,idle,tales,and,could,not,be,relied,on,and,the,books,that,illyrio,had,provided,them,were,not,the,ones,he,might,have,wished,for,<END>

when,the,halfmaester,appeared,on,deck,yawning,the,dwarf,was,writing,down,what,he,recalled,concerning,the,mating,habits,of,dragons,on,which,subject,barth,munkun,and,thomax,held,markedly,divergent,views,<END>

it,was,an,alley,<END>
it,had,no,name,<END>

the,best,lies,are,seasoned,with,a,bit,of,truth,<END>
the,dwarf,knew,he,sounded,like,a,westerman,and,a,highborn,westerman,at,that,so,hugor,must,needs,be,some,lordling's,byblow,<END>
born,in,lannisport,because,he,knew,that,city,better,than,oldtown,or,king's,landing,and,cities,were,where,most,dwarfs,ended,up,even,those,whelped,by,goodwife,bumpkin,in,the,turnip,patch,<END>

haldon,laced,up,his,breeches,<END>
not,all,of,us,can,be,half,a,maester,<END>
tyrion's,hand,was,cramping,<END>
he,put,his,quill,aside,and,flexed,his,stubby,fingers,<END>
fancy,another,game,of,cyvasse,<END>
the,halfmaester,always,defeated,him,but,it,was,a,way,to,pass,the,time,<END>
this,evening,<END>
will,you,join,us,for,young,griff's,lesson,<END>
why,not,<END>
someone,needs,to,correct,your,errors,<END>
there,were,four,cabins,on,the,shy,maid,<END>
yandry,and,ysilla,shared,one,griff,and,young,griff,another,<END>
septa,lemore,had,a,cabin,to,herself,as,did,haldon,<END>
the,halfmaester's,cabin,was,the,largest,of,the,four,<END>
one,wall,was,lined,with,bookshelves,and,bins,stacked,with,old,scrolls,and,parchments,another,held,racks,of,ointments,herbs,and,potions,<END>
golden,light,slanted,through,the,wavy,yellow,glass,of,the,round,window,<END>
the,furnishings,included,a,bunk,a,writing,desk,a,chair,a,stool,and,the,halfmaester's,cyvasse,table,strewn,with,carved,wooden,pieces,<END>
the,lesson,began,with,languages,<END>
young,griff,spoke,the,common,tongue,as,if,he,had,been,born,to,it,and,was,fluent,in,high,valyrian,the,low,dialects,of,pentos,tyrosh,myr,and,lys,and,the,trade,talk,of,sailors,<END>
the,volantene,dialect,was,as,new,to,him,as,it,was,to,tyrion,so,every,day,they,learned,a,few,more,words,whilst,haldon,corrected,their,mistakes,<END>
meereenese,was,harder,its,roots,were,valyrian,as,well,but,the,tree,had,been,grafted,onto,the,harsh,ugly,tongue,of,old,ghis,<END>
you,need,a,bee,up,your,nose,to,speak,ghiscari,properly,tyrion,complained,<END>
young,griff,laughed,but,the,halfmaester,only,said,again,<END>
the,boy,obeyed,though,he,rolled,his,eyes,along,with,his,zzzs,this,time,<END>
he,has,a,better,ear,than,me,tyrion,was,forced,to,admit,though,i'll,wager,my,tongue,is,still,more,nimble,<END>
geometry,followed,languages,<END>
there,the,boy,was,less,adroit,but,haldon,was,a,patient,teacher,and,tyrion,was,able,to,make,himself,of,use,as,well,<END>
he,had,learned,the,mysteries,of,squares,and,circles,and,triangles,from,his,father's,maesters,at,casterly,rock,and,they,came,back,more,quickly,than,he,would,have,thought,<END>
by,the,time,they,turned,to,history,young,griff,was,growing,restive,<END>
we,were,discussing,the,history,of,volantis,haldon,said,to,him,<END>
can,you,tell,yollo,the,difference,between,a,tiger,and,an,elephant,<END>
volantis,is,the,oldest,of,the,nine,free,cities,first,daughter,of,valyria,the,lad,replied,in,a,bored,tone,<END>
after,the,doom,it,pleased,the,volantenes,to,consider,themselves,the,heirs,of,the,freehold,and,rightful,rulers,of,the,world,but,they,were,divided,as,to,how,dominion,might,best,be,achieved,<END>
the,old,blood,favored,the,sword,while,the,merchants,and,moneylenders,advocated,trade,<END>
as,they,contended,for,rule,of,the,city,the,factions,became,known,as,the,tigers,and,elephants,respectively,<END>
the,tigers,held,sway,for,almost,a,century,after,the,doom,of,valyria,<END>
for,a,time,they,were,successful,<END>
a,volantene,fleet,took,lys,and,a,volantene,army,captured,myr,and,for,two,generations,all,three,cities,were,ruled,from,within,the,black,walls,<END>
that,ended,when,the,tigers,tried,to,swallow,tyrosh,<END>
pentos,came,into,the,war,on,the,tyroshi,side,along,with,the,westerosi,storm,king,<END>
braavos,provided,a,lyseni,exile,with,a,hundred,warships,aegon,targaryen,flew,forth,from,dragonstone,on,the,black,dread,and,myr,and,lys,rose,up,in,rebellion,<END>
the,war,left,the,disputed,lands,a,waste,and,freed,lys,and,myr,from,the,yoke,<END>
the,tigers,suffered,other,defeats,as,well,<END>
the,fleet,they,sent,to,reclaim,valyria,vanished,in,the,smoking,sea,<END>
qohor,and,norvos,broke,their,power,on,the,rhoyne,when,the,fire,galleys,fought,on,dagger,lake,<END>
out,of,the,east,came,the,dothraki,driving,smallfolk,from,their,hovels,and,nobles,from,their,estates,until,only,grass,and,ruins,remained,from,the,forest,of,qohor,to,the,headwaters,of,the,selhoru,<END>
after,a,century,of,war,volantis,found,herself,broken,bankrupt,and,depopulated,<END>
it,was,then,that,the,elephants,rose,up,<END>
they,have,held,sway,ever,since,<END>
some,years,the,tigers,elect,a,triarch,and,some,years,they,do,not,but,never,more,than,one,so,the,elephants,have,ruled,the,city,for,three,hundred,years,<END>
just,so,said,haldon,<END>
and,the,present,triarchs,<END>
malaquo,is,a,tiger,nyessos,and,doniphos,are,elephants,<END>
and,what,lesson,can,we,draw,from,volantene,history,<END>
if,you,want,to,conquer,the,world,you,best,have,dragons,<END>
tyrion,could,not,help,but,laugh,<END>
later,when,young,griff,went,up,on,deck,to,help,yandry,with,the,sails,and,poles,haldon,set,up,his,cyvasse,table,for,their,game,<END>
tyrion,watched,with,mismatched,eyes,and,said,the,boy,is,bright,<END>
you,have,done,well,by,him,<END>
half,the,lords,in,westeros,are,not,so,learned,sad,to,say,<END>
languages,history,songs,sums,a,heady,stew,for,some,sellsword's,son,<END>
a,book,can,be,as,dangerous,as,a,sword,in,the,right,hands,said,haldon,<END>
try,to,give,me,a,better,battle,this,time,yollo,<END>
you,play,cyvasse,as,badly,as,you,tumble,<END>
i,am,trying,to,lull,you,into,a,false,sense,of,confidence,said,tyrion,as,they,arranged,their,tiles,on,either,side,of,a,carved,wooden,screen,<END>
you,think,you,taught,me,how,to,play,but,things,are,not,always,as,they,seem,<END>
perhaps,i,learned,the,game,from,the,cheesemonger,have,you,considered,that,<END>
illyrio,does,not,play,cyvasse,<END>
no,thought,the,dwarf,he,plays,the,game,of,thrones,and,you,and,griff,and,duck,are,only,pieces,to,be,moved,where,he,will,and,sacrificed,at,need,just,as,he,sacrificed,viserys,<END>
the,blame,must,fall,on,you,then,<END>
if,i,play,badly,it,is,your,doing,<END>
the,halfmaester,chuckled,<END>
yollo,i,shall,miss,you,when,the,pirates,cut,your,throat,<END>
where,are,these,famous,pirates,<END>
i,am,beginning,to,think,that,you,and,illyrio,made,them,all,up,<END>
they,are,thickest,on,the,stretch,of,river,between,ar,noy,and,the,sorrows,<END>
above,the,ruins,of,ar,noy,the,qohorik,rule,the,river,and,below,the,sorrows,the,galleys,of,volantis,hold,sway,but,neither,city,claims,the,waters,in,between,so,the,pirates,have,made,it,their,own,<END>
dagger,lake,is,full,of,islands,where,they,lurk,in,hidden,caves,and,secret,strongholds,<END>
are,you,ready,<END>
for,you,<END>
beyond,a,doubt,<END>
for,the,pirates,<END>
less,so,<END>
haldon,removed,the,screen,<END>
each,of,them,contemplated,the,other's,opening,array,<END>
you,are,learning,the,halfmaester,said,<END>
tyrion,almost,grabbed,his,dragon,but,thought,better,of,it,<END>
last,game,he,had,brought,her,out,too,soon,and,lost,her,to,a,trebuchet,<END>
if,we,do,meet,these,fabled,pirates,i,may,join,up,with,them,<END>
i'll,tell,them,that,my,name,is,hugor,halfmaester,<END>
he,moved,his,light,horse,toward,haldon's,mountains,<END>
haldon,answered,with,an,elephant,<END>
hugor,halfwit,would,suit,you,better,<END>
i,only,need,half,my,wits,to,be,a,match,for,you,<END>
tyrion,moved,up,his,heavy,horse,to,support,the,light,<END>
perhaps,you,would,care,to,wager,on,the,outcome,<END>
the,halfmaester,arched,an,eyebrow,<END>
how,much,<END>
i,have,no,coin,<END>
we'll,play,for,secrets,<END>
griff,would,cut,my,tongue,out,<END>
afraid,are,you,<END>
i,would,be,if,i,were,you,<END>
the,day,you,defeat,me,at,cyvasse,will,be,the,day,turtles,crawl,out,my,arse,<END>
the,halfmaester,moved,his,spears,<END>
you,have,your,wager,little,man,<END>
tyrion,stretched,a,hand,out,for,his,dragon,<END>
it,was,three,hours,later,when,the,little,man,finally,crept,back,up,on,deck,to,empty,his,bladder,<END>
duck,was,helping,yandry,wrestle,down,the,sail,while,ysilla,took,the,tiller,<END>
the,sun,hung,low,above,the,reed-beds,along,the,western,bank,as,the,wind,began,to,gust,and,rip,<END>
i,need,that,skin,of,wine,the,dwarf,thought,<END>
his,legs,were,cramped,from,squatting,on,that,stool,and,he,felt,so,light-headed,that,he,was,lucky,not,to,fall,into,the,river,<END>
yollo,duck,called,<END>
where's,haldon,<END>
he's,taken,to,his,bed,in,some,discomfort,<END>
there,are,turtles,crawling,out,his,arse,<END>
he,left,the,knight,to,sort,that,out,and,crawled,up,the,ladder,to,the,cabin,roof,<END>
off,to,the,east,there,was,darkness,gathering,behind,a,rocky,island,<END>
septa,lemore,found,him,there,<END>

and,beyond,that,lie,the,sorrows,<END>
not,mine,<END>
i,carry,mine,own,sorrows,with,me,everywhere,i,go,<END>
he,thought,of,tysha,and,wondered,where,whores,go,<END>
why,not,volantis,<END>
perhaps,i'll,find,her,there,<END>
a,man,should,cling,to,hope,<END>
he,wondered,what,he,would,say,to,her,<END>
i,am,sorry,that,i,let,them,rape,you,love,<END>
i,thought,you,were,a,whore,<END>
can,you,find,it,in,your,heart,to,forgive,me,<END>

the,island,fell,away,behind,them,<END>
tyrion,saw,ruins,rising,along,the,eastern,bank,crooked,walls,and,fallen,towers,broken,domes,and,rows,of,rotted,wooden,pillars,streets,choked,by,mud,and,overgrown,with,purple,moss,<END>

if,they,should,dare,attack,me,this,time,i,shall,raze,their,yellow,city,to,the,ground,<END>
and,whilst,you,are,razing,yunkai,my,sweet,meereen,shall,rise,behind,you,<END>
do,not,close,your,eyes,to,your,peril,daenerys,<END>

my,freedman,dany,started,<END>
bedslaves,barbers,and,brickmakers,win,no,battles,<END>
he,was,wrong,in,that,she,hoped,<END>

let,him,think,what,he,will,<END>
have,you,forgotten,<END>
i,have,dragons,<END>
do,you,<END>
in,qarth,you,were,seldom,seen,without,a,dragon,on,your,shoulder,yet,now,that,shapely,shoulder,is,as,fair,and,bare,as,your,sweet,breast,i,observe,<END>
my,dragons,have,grown,my,shoulders,have,not,<END>
they,range,far,afield,hunting,<END>

ask,the,good,masters,of,astapor,about,my,dragons,if,you,doubt,them,<END>
i,saw,a,slaver's,eyes,melt,and,go,running,down,his,cheeks,<END>

to,bring,a,gift,for,the,queen,of,my,heart,<END>
say,on,<END>
what,trap,is,this,now,<END>
the,gift,you,begged,of,me,in,qarth,<END>
ships,<END>
there,are,thirteen,galleys,in,the,bay,<END>
yours,if,you,will,have,them,<END>
i,have,brought,you,a,fleet,to,carry,you,home,to,westeros,<END>
a,fleet,<END>
it,was,more,than,she,could,hope,for,so,of,course,it,made,her,wary,<END>
in,qarth,xaro,had,offered,her,thirty,ships,for,a,dragon,<END>
and,what,price,do,you,ask,for,these,ships,<END>
none,<END>
i,no,longer,lust,for,dragons,<END>
i,saw,their,work,at,astapor,on,my,way,here,when,my,silken,cloud,put,in,for,water,<END>
the,ships,are,yours,sweet,queen,<END>
thirteen,galleys,and,men,to,pull,the,oars,<END>
thirteen,<END>
to,be,sure,<END>
xaro,was,one,of,the,thirteen,<END>
no,doubt,he,had,convinced,each,of,his,fellow,members,to,give,up,one,ship,<END>
she,knew,the,merchant,prince,too,well,to,think,that,he,would,sacrifice,thirteen,of,his,own,ships,<END>
i,must,consider,this,<END>
may,i,inspect,these,ships,<END>
you,have,grown,suspicious,daenerys,<END>
always,<END>
i,have,grown,wise,xaro,<END>
inspect,all,you,wish,<END>
when,you,are,satisfied,swear,to,me,that,you,shall,return,to,westeros,forthwith,and,the,ships,are,yours,<END>
swear,by,your,dragons,and,your,seven-faced,god,and,the,ashes,of,your,fathers,and,go,<END>
and,if,i,should,decide,to,wait,a,year,or,three,<END>
a,mournful,look,crossed,xaro's,face,<END>
that,would,make,me,very,sad,my,sweet,delight,for,young,and,strong,as,you,now,seem,you,shall,not,live,so,long,<END>
not,here,<END>
he,offers,the,honeycomb,with,one,hand,and,shows,the,whip,with,the,other,<END>
the,yunkai'i,are,not,so,fearsome,as,all,that,<END>
not,all,your,enemies,are,in,the,yellow,city,<END>
beware,men,with,cold,hearts,and,blue,lips,<END>
you,had,not,been,gone,from,qarth,a,fortnight,when,pyat,pree,set,out,with,three,of,his,fellow,warlocks,to,seek,for,you,in,pentos,<END>
dany,was,more,amused,than,afraid,<END>
it,is,good,i,turned,aside,then,<END>
pentos,is,half,a,world,from,meereen,<END>
this,is,so,he,allowed,yet,soon,or,late,word,must,reach,them,of,the,dragon,queen,of,slaver's,bay,<END>
is,that,meant,to,frighten,me,<END>
i,lived,in,fear,for,fourteen,years,my,lord,<END>
i,woke,afraid,each,morning,and,went,to,sleep,afraid,each,night,but,my,fears,were,burned,away,the,day,i,came,forth,from,the,fire,<END>
only,one,thing,frightens,me,now,<END>
and,what,is,it,that,you,fear,sweet,queen,<END>
i,am,only,a,foolish,young,girl,<END>
dany,rose,on,her,toes,and,kissed,his,cheek,<END>
but,not,so,foolish,as,to,tell,you,that,<END>
my,men,shall,look,at,these,ships,<END>
then,you,shall,have,my,answer,<END>
as,you,say,<END>
he,touched,her,bare,breast,lightly,and,whispered,let,me,stay,and,help,persuade,you,<END>
for,a,moment,she,was,tempted,<END>
perhaps,the,dancers,had,stirred,her,after,all,<END>
i,could,close,my,eyes,and,pretend,that,he,was,daario,<END>
a,dream,daario,would,be,safer,than,the,real,one,<END>
but,she,pushed,the,thought,aside,<END>
no,my,lord,<END>
i,thank,you,but,no,<END>
dany,slipped,from,his,arms,<END>
some,other,night,perhaps,<END>
some,other,night,<END>
his,mouth,was,sad,but,his,eyes,seemed,more,relieved,than,disappointed,<END>
if,i,were,a,dragon,i,could,fly,to,westeros,she,thought,when,he,was,gone,<END>
i,would,have,no,need,of,xaro,or,his,ships,<END>
dany,wondered,how,many,men,thirteen,galleys,could,hold,<END>
it,had,taken,three,to,carry,her,and,her,khalasar,from,qarth,to,astapor,but,that,was,before,she,had,acquired,eight,thousand,unsullied,a,thousand,sellswords,and,a,vast,horde,of,freedmen,<END>
and,the,dragons,what,am,i,to,do,with,them,<END>
drogon,she,whispered,softly,where,are,you,<END>
for,a,moment,she,could,almost,see,him,sweeping,across,the,sky,his,black,wings,swallowing,the,stars,<END>
she,turned,her,back,upon,the,night,to,where,barristan,selmy,stood,silent,in,the,shadows,<END>
my,brother,once,told,me,a,westerosi,riddle,<END>
who,listens,to,everything,yet,hears,nothing,<END>
a,knight,of,the,kingsguard,<END>
selmy's,voice,was,solemn,<END>
you,heard,xaro,make,his,offer,<END>
i,did,your,grace,<END>
the,old,knight,took,pains,not,to,look,at,her,bare,breast,as,he,spoke,to,her,<END>
ser,jorah,would,not,turn,his,eyes,away,<END>
he,loved,me,as,a,woman,where,ser,barristan,loves,me,only,as,his,queen,<END>
mormont,had,been,an,informer,reporting,to,her,enemies,in,westeros,yet,he,had,given,her,good,counsel,too,<END>
what,do,you,think,of,it,<END>
of,him,<END>
of,him,little,and,less,<END>
these,ships,though,your,grace,with,these,ships,we,might,be,home,before,year's,end,<END>
dany,had,never,known,a,home,<END>
in,braavos,there,had,been,a,house,with,a,red,door,but,that,was,all,<END>
beware,of,qartheen,bearing,gifts,especially,merchants,of,the,thirteen,<END>
there,is,some,trap,here,<END>
perhaps,these,ships,are,rotten,or,if,they,were,so,unseaworthy,they,could,not,have,crossed,the,sea,from,qarth,ser,barristan,pointed,out,but,your,grace,was,wise,to,insist,upon,inspection,<END>
i,will,take,admiral,groleo,to,the,galleys,at,first,light,with,his,captains,and,two,score,of,his,sailors,<END>
we,can,crawl,over,every,inch,of,those,ships,<END>
it,was,good,counsel,<END>
yes,make,it,so,<END>
westeros,<END>
home,<END>
but,if,she,left,what,would,happen,to,her,city,<END>
meereen,was,never,your,city,her,brother's,voice,seemed,to,whisper,<END>
your,cities,are,across,the,sea,<END>
your,seven,kingdoms,where,your,enemies,await,you,<END>
you,were,born,to,serve,them,blood,and,fire,<END>
ser,barristan,cleared,his,throat,and,said,this,warlock,that,the,merchant,spoke,of,pyat,pree,<END>
she,tried,to,recall,his,face,but,all,she,could,see,were,his,lips,<END>
the,wine,of,the,warlocks,had,turned,them,blue,<END>
shade-of-the-evening,it,was,called,<END>
if,a,warlock's,spell,could,kill,me,i,would,be,dead,by,now,<END>
i,left,their,palace,all,in,ashes,<END>
drogon,saved,me,when,they,would,have,drained,my,life,from,me,<END>
drogon,burned,them,all,<END>
as,you,say,your,grace,<END>
still,<END>
i,will,be,watchful,<END>
she,kissed,him,on,the,cheek,<END>
i,know,you,will,<END>
come,walk,me,back,down,to,the,feast,<END>
the,next,morning,dany,woke,as,full,of,hope,as,she,had,been,since,first,she,came,to,slaver's,bay,<END>
daario,would,soon,be,at,her,side,once,more,and,together,they,would,sail,for,westeros,<END>
for,home,<END>
one,of,her,young,hostages,brought,her,morning,meal,a,plump,shy,girl,named,mezzara,whose,father,ruled,the,pyramid,of,merreq,and,dany,gave,her,a,happy,hug,and,thanked,her,with,a,kiss,<END>
xaro,xhoan,daxos,has,offered,me,thirteen,galleys,she,told,irri,and,jhiqui,as,they,were,dressing,her,for,court,<END>
thirteen,is,a,bad,number,khaleesi,murmured,jhiqui,in,the,dothraki,tongue,<END>
it,is,known,<END>
it,is,known,irri,agreed,<END>
thirty,would,be,better,daenerys,agreed,<END>
three,hundred,better,still,<END>
but,thirteen,may,suffice,to,carry,us,to,westeros,<END>
the,two,dothraki,girls,exchanged,a,look,<END>
the,poison,water,is,accursed,khaleesi,said,irri,<END>
horses,cannot,drink,it,<END>
i,do,not,intend,to,drink,it,dany,promised,them,<END>
only,four,petitioners,awaited,her,that,morning,<END>
as,ever,lord,ghael,was,the,first,to,present,himself,looking,even,more,wretched,than,usual,<END>
your,radiance,he,moaned,as,he,fell,to,the,marble,at,her,feet,the,armies,of,the,yunkai'i,descend,on,astapor,<END>
i,beg,you,come,south,with,all,your,strength,<END>
i,warned,your,king,that,this,war,of,his,was,folly,dany,reminded,him,<END>
he,would,not,listen,<END>
great,cleon,sought,only,to,strike,down,the,vile,slavers,of,yunkai,<END>
great,cleon,is,a,slaver,himself,<END>
i,know,that,the,mother,of,dragons,will,not,abandon,us,in,our,hour,of,peril,<END>
lend,us,your,unsullied,to,defend,our,walls,<END>
and,if,i,do,who,will,defend,my,walls,<END>
many,of,my,freedmen,were,slaves,in,astapor,<END>
perhaps,some,will,wish,to,help,defend,your,king,<END>
that,is,their,choice,as,free,men,<END>
i,gave,astapor,its,freedom,<END>
it,is,up,to,you,to,defend,it,<END>
we,are,all,dead,then,<END>
you,gave,us,death,not,freedom,<END>
ghael,leapt,to,his,feet,and,spat,into,her,face,<END>
strong,belwas,seized,him,by,the,shoulder,and,slammed,him,down,onto,the,marble,so,hard,that,dany,heard,ghael's,teeth,crack,<END>
the,shavepate,would,have,done,worse,but,she,stopped,him,<END>
enough,she,said,dabbing,at,her,cheek,with,the,end,of,her,tokar,<END>
no,one,has,ever,died,from,spittle,<END>
take,him,away,<END>
they,dragged,him,out,feet,first,leaving,several,broken,teeth,and,a,trail,of,blood,behind,<END>
dany,would,gladly,have,sent,the,rest,of,the,petitioners,away,but,she,was,still,their,queen,so,she,heard,them,out,and,did,her,best,to,give,them,justice,<END>
late,that,afternoon,admiral,groleo,and,ser,barristan,returned,from,their,inspection,of,the,galleys,<END>
dany,assembled,her,council,to,hear,them,<END>
grey,worm,was,there,for,the,unsullied,skahaz,mo,kandaq,for,the,brazen,beasts,<END>
in,the,absence,of,her,bloodriders,a,wizened,jaqqa,rhan,called,rommo,squint-eyed,and,bowlegged,came,to,speak,for,her,dothraki,<END>

both,of,those,were,lacking,<END>

we,cannot,leave,king,stannis,and,his,men,to,starve,even,if,we,wished,to,jon,said,<END>

you,were,as,cold,as,ice,and,your,lips,were,blue,<END>
yandry,said,we,ought,to,throw,you,back,but,the,lad,forbade,it,<END>
the,prince,<END>

the,dwarf,flinched,<END>
the,knife,landed,between,his,feet,and,stood,quivering,in,the,deck,<END>
he,plucked,it,out,<END>
what's,this,<END>
take,off,your,boots,<END>

tyrion,yanked,off,one,boot,and,then,the,other,peeled,down,his,hose,squinted,at,his,toes,<END>
it,seemed,to,him,they,looked,no,better,or,worse,than,usual,<END>

it,is,only,when,you,cannot,feel,the,blade,that,you,will,have,cause,to,fear,<END>

that,hurt,<END>
are,you,happy,<END>
dancing,with,joy,<END>
your,feet,smell,worse,than,mine,yollo,<END>

griff,warned,you,not,to,lay,hands,upon,the,stone,men,<END>
aye,but,he,forgot,to,warn,the,stone,men,not,to,lay,their,hands,upon,me,<END>
as,you,prick,look,for,patches,of,dead,grey,skin,for,nails,beginning,to,turn,black,said,haldon,<END>
if,you,see,such,signs,do,not,hesitate,<END>
better,to,lose,a,toe,than,a,foot,<END>
better,to,lose,an,arm,than,spend,your,days,wailing,on,the,bridge,of,dream,<END>
now,the,other,foot,if,you,please,<END>
then,your,fingers,<END>
the,dwarf,recrossed,his,stunted,legs,and,began,to,prick,the,other,set,of,toes,<END>
shall,i,prick,my,prick,as,well,<END>
it,would,not,hurt,<END>
it,would,not,hurt,you,is,what,you,mean,<END>
though,i,had,as,well,slice,it,off,for,all,the,use,i,make,of,it,<END>

we,will,have,it,tanned,and,stuffed,and,sell,it,for,a,fortune,<END>
a,dwarf's,cock,has,magical,powers,<END>
i,have,been,telling,all,the,women,that,for,years,<END>
tyrion,drove,the,dagger's,point,into,the,ball,of,his,thumb,watched,the,blood,bead,up,sucked,it,away,<END>
how,long,must,i,continue,to,torture,myself,<END>
when,will,we,be,certain,that,i'm,clean,<END>
truly,<END>
said,the,halfmaester,<END>
never,<END>
you,swallowed,half,the,river,<END>
you,may,be,going,grey,even,now,turning,to,stone,from,inside,out,starting,with,your,heart,and,lungs,<END>
if,so,pricking,your,toes,and,bathing,in,vinegar,will,not,save,you,<END>
when,you're,done,come,have,some,broth,<END>
the,broth,was,good,though,tyrion,noted,that,the,halfmaester,kept,the,table,between,them,as,he,ate,<END>
the,shy,maid,was,moored,to,a,weathered,pier,on,the,east,bank,of,the,rhoyne,<END>
two,piers,down,a,volantene,river,galley,was,discharging,soldiers,<END>
shops,and,stalls,and,storehouses,huddled,beneath,a,sandstone,wall,<END>
the,towers,and,domes,of,the,city,were,visible,beyond,it,reddened,by,the,light,of,the,setting,sun,<END>
no,not,a,city,<END>
selhorys,was,still,accounted,a,mere,town,and,was,ruled,from,old,volantis,<END>
this,was,not,westeros,<END>
lemore,emerged,on,deck,with,the,prince,in,tow,<END>
when,she,saw,tyrion,she,rushed,across,the,deck,to,hug,him,<END>
the,mother,is,merciful,<END>
we,have,prayed,for,you,hugor,<END>
you,did,at,least,<END>
i,won't,hold,that,against,you,<END>
young,griff's,greeting,was,less,effusive,<END>
the,princeling,was,in,a,sullen,mood,angry,that,he,had,been,forced,to,remain,on,the,shy,maid,instead,of,going,ashore,with,yandry,and,ysilla,<END>
we,only,want,to,keep,you,safe,lemore,told,him,<END>
these,are,unsettled,times,<END>
haldon,halfmaester,explained,<END>
on,the,way,down,from,the,sorrows,to,selhorys,we,thrice,glimpsed,riders,moving,south,along,the,river's,eastern,shore,<END>
dothraki,<END>
once,they,were,so,close,we,could,hear,the,bells,tinkling,in,their,braids,and,sometimes,at,night,their,fires,could,be,seen,beyond,the,eastern,hills,<END>
we,passed,warships,as,well,volantene,river,galleys,crammed,with,slave,soldiers,<END>
the,triarchs,fear,an,attack,upon,selhorys,plainly,<END>
tyrion,understood,that,quick,enough,<END>
alone,amongst,the,major,river,towns,selhorys,stood,upon,the,eastern,bank,of,the,rhoyne,making,it,much,more,vulnerable,to,the,horselords,than,its,sister,towns,across,the,river,<END>
even,so,it,is,a,small,prize,<END>
if,i,were,khal,i,would,feint,at,selhorys,let,the,volantenes,rush,to,defend,it,then,swing,south,and,ride,hard,for,volantis,itself,<END>
i,know,how,to,use,a,sword,young,griff,was,insisting,<END>
even,the,bravest,of,your,forebears,kept,his,kingsguard,close,about,him,in,times,of,peril,<END>
lemore,had,changed,out,of,her,septa's,robes,into,garb,more,befitting,the,wife,or,daughter,of,a,prosperous,merchant,<END>
tyrion,watched,her,closely,<END>
he,had,sniffed,out,the,truth,beneath,the,dyed,blue,hair,of,griff,and,young,griff,easily,enough,and,yandry,and,ysilla,seemed,to,be,no,more,than,they,claimed,to,be,whilst,duck,was,somewhat,less,<END>
lemore,though,who,is,she,really,<END>
why,is,she,here,<END>
not,for,gold,i'd,judge,<END>
what,is,this,prince,to,her,<END>
was,she,ever,a,true,septa,<END>
haldon,took,note,of,her,change,of,garb,as,well,<END>
what,are,we,to,make,of,this,sudden,loss,of,faith,<END>
i,preferred,you,in,your,septa's,robes,lemore,<END>
i,preferred,her,naked,said,tyrion,<END>
lemore,gave,him,a,reproachful,look,<END>
that,is,because,you,have,a,wicked,soul,<END>
septa's,robes,scream,of,westeros,and,might,draw,unwelcome,eyes,onto,us,<END>
she,turned,back,to,prince,aegon,<END>
you,are,not,the,only,one,who,must,needs,hide,<END>
the,lad,did,not,seem,appeased,<END>
the,perfect,prince,but,still,half,a,boy,for,all,that,with,little,and,less,experience,of,the,world,and,all,its,woes,<END>
prince,aegon,said,tyrion,since,we're,both,stuck,aboard,this,boat,perhaps,you,will,honor,me,with,a,game,of,cyvasse,to,while,away,the,hours,<END>
the,prince,gave,him,a,wary,look,<END>
i,am,sick,of,cyvasse,<END>
sick,of,losing,to,a,dwarf,you,mean,<END>
that,pricked,the,lad's,pride,just,as,tyrion,had,known,it,would,<END>
go,fetch,the,board,and,pieces,<END>
this,time,i,mean,to,smash,you,<END>
they,played,on,deck,sitting,cross-legged,behind,the,cabin,<END>
young,griff,arrayed,his,army,for,attack,with,dragon,elephants,and,heavy,horse,up,front,<END>
a,young,man's,formation,as,bold,as,it,is,foolish,<END>
he,risks,all,for,the,quick,kill,<END>
he,let,the,prince,have,first,move,<END>
haldon,stood,behind,them,watching,the,play,<END>
when,the,prince,reached,for,his,dragon,tyrion,cleared,his,throat,<END>
i,would,not,do,that,if,i,were,you,<END>
it,is,a,mistake,to,bring,your,dragon,out,too,soon,<END>
he,smiled,innocently,<END>
your,father,knew,the,dangers,of,being,overbold,<END>
did,you,know,my,true,father,<END>
well,i,saw,him,twice,or,thrice,but,i,was,only,ten,when,robert,killed,him,and,mine,own,sire,had,me,hidden,underneath,a,rock,<END>
no,i,cannot,claim,i,knew,prince,rhaegar,<END>
not,as,your,false,father,did,<END>
lord,connington,was,the,prince's,dearest,friend,was,he,not,<END>
young,griff,pushed,a,lock,of,blue,hair,out,of,his,eyes,<END>
they,were,squires,together,at,king's,landing,<END>
a,true,friend,our,lord,connington,<END>
he,must,be,to,remain,so,fiercely,loyal,to,the,grandson,of,the,king,who,took,his,lands,and,titles,and,sent,him,into,exile,<END>
a,pity,about,that,<END>
elsewise,prince,rhaegar's,friend,might,have,been,on,hand,when,my,father,sacked,king's,landing,to,save,prince,rhaegar's,precious,little,son,from,getting,his,royal,brains,dashed,out,against,a,wall,<END>
the,lad,flushed,<END>
that,was,not,me,<END>
i,told,you,<END>
that,was,some,tanner's,son,from,pisswater,bend,whose,mother,died,birthing,him,<END>
his,father,sold,him,to,lord,varys,for,a,jug,of,arbor,gold,<END>
he,had,other,sons,but,had,never,tasted,arbor,gold,<END>
varys,gave,the,pisswater,boy,to,my,lady,mother,and,carried,me,away,<END>
aye,<END>
tyrion,moved,his,elephants,<END>
and,when,the,pisswater,prince,was,safely,dead,the,eunuch,smuggled,you,across,the,narrow,sea,to,his,fat,friend,the,cheesemonger,who,hid,you,on,a,poleboat,and,found,an,exile,lord,willing,to,call,himself,your,father,<END>
it,does,make,for,a,splendid,story,and,the,singers,will,make,much,of,your,escape,once,you,take,the,iron,throne,assuming,that,our,fair,daenerys,takes,you,for,her,consort,<END>
she,will,<END>
she,must,<END>
must,<END>
tyrion,made,a,tsking,sound,<END>
that,is,not,a,word,queens,like,to,hear,<END>
you,are,her,perfect,prince,agreed,bright,and,bold,and,comely,as,any,maid,could,wish,<END>
daenerys,targaryen,is,no,maid,however,<END>

she,may,not,prove,as,willing,as,you,wish,<END>
she'll,be,willing,<END>
prince,aegon,sounded,shocked,<END>
it,was,plain,that,he,had,never,before,considered,the,possibility,that,his,bride-to-be,might,refuse,him,<END>
you,don't,know,her,<END>
he,picked,up,his,heavy,horse,and,put,it,down,with,a,thump,<END>
the,dwarf,shrugged,<END>
i,know,that,she,spent,her,childhood,in,exile,impoverished,living,on,dreams,and,schemes,running,from,one,city,to,the,next,always,fearful,never,safe,friendless,but,for,a,brother,who,was,by,all,accounts,half-mad,a,brother,who,sold,her,maidenhood,to,the,dothraki,for,the,promise,of,an,army,<END>
i,know,that,somewhere,out,upon,the,grass,her,dragons,hatched,and,so,did,she,<END>

the,gossip,of,fishmongers,is,not,to,be,relied,on,<END>

you,know,how,he,is,<END>
the,halfmaester,went,below,<END>
the,girl,never,started,for,the,west,<END>
no,doubt,she,had,good,reasons,<END>
between,meereen,and,volantis,lay,five,hundred,leagues,of,deserts,mountains,swamps,and,ruins,plus,mantarys,with,its,sinister,repute,<END>
a,city,of,monsters,they,say,but,if,she,marches,overland,where,else,is,she,to,turn,for,food,and,water,<END>
the,sea,would,be,swifter,but,if,she,does,not,have,the,ships,by,the,time,griff,appeared,on,deck,the,pike,was,spitting,and,sizzling,over,the,brazier,whilst,ysilla,hovered,over,it,with,a,lemon,squeezing,<END>
the,sellsword,wore,his,mail,and,wolfskin,cloak,soft,leather,gloves,dark,woolen,breeches,<END>
if,he,was,surprised,to,see,tyrion,awake,he,gave,no,sign,beyond,his,customary,scowl,<END>
he,took,yandry,back,to,the,tiller,where,they,spoke,in,low,voices,too,quietly,for,the,dwarf,to,hear,<END>
finally,griff,beckoned,to,haldon,<END>
we,need,to,know,the,truth,of,these,rumors,<END>
go,ashore,and,learn,what,you,can,<END>
qavo,will,know,if,you,can,find,him,<END>
try,the,riverman,and,the,painted,turtle,<END>
you,know,his,other,places,<END>

as,you,wish,<END>
be,back,before,the,sun,comes,up,<END>
if,for,any,reason,you're,delayed,make,your,way,to,the,golden,company,<END>
spoken,like,a,lord,<END>
tyrion,kept,the,thought,to,himself,<END>
haldon,donned,a,hooded,cloak,and,tyrion,shed,his,homemade,motley,for,something,drab,and,grey,<END>
griff,allowed,them,each,a,purse,of,silver,from,illyrio's,chests,<END>
to,loosen,tongues,<END>
dusk,was,giving,way,to,darkness,as,they,made,their,way,along,the,riverfront,<END>
some,of,the,ships,they,passed,appeared,deserted,their,gangplanks,drawn,up,<END>
others,crawled,with,armed,men,who,eyed,them,with,suspicion,<END>
under,the,town,walls,parchment,lanterns,had,been,lit,above,the,stalls,throwing,pools,of,colored,light,upon,the,cobbled,path,<END>
tyrion,watched,as,haldon's,face,turned,green,then,red,then,purple,<END>
under,the,cacophony,of,foreign,tongues,he,heard,queer,music,playing,from,somewhere,up,ahead,a,thin,high,fluting,accompanied,by,drums,<END>
a,dog,was,barking,too,behind,them,<END>
and,the,whores,were,out,<END>
river,or,sea,a,port,was,a,port,and,wherever,you,found,sailors,you'd,find,whores,<END>
is,that,what,my,father,meant,<END>
is,that,where,whores,go,to,the,sea,<END>
the,whores,of,lannisport,and,king's,landing,were,free,women,<END>
their,sisters,of,selhorys,were,slaves,their,bondage,indicated,by,the,tears,tattooed,beneath,their,right,eyes,<END>
old,as,sin,and,twice,as,ugly,the,lot,of,them,<END>
it,was,almost,enough,to,put,a,man,off,whoring,<END>
tyrion,felt,their,eyes,upon,them,as,he,waddled,by,and,heard,them,whispering,to,one,another,and,giggling,behind,their,hands,<END>
you,would,think,they,had,never,seen,a,dwarf,before,<END>
a,squad,of,volantene,spearmen,stood,guard,at,the,river,gate,<END>
torchlight,gleamed,off,the,steel,claws,that,jutted,from,their,gauntlets,<END>
their,helms,were,tiger's,masks,the,faces,beneath,marked,by,green,stripes,tattooed,across,both,cheeks,<END>
the,slave,soldiers,of,volantis,were,fiercely,proud,of,their,tiger,stripes,tyrion,knew,<END>
do,they,yearn,for,freedom,<END>
he,wondered,<END>
what,would,they,do,if,this,child,queen,bestowed,it,on,them,<END>
what,are,they,if,not,tigers,<END>
what,am,i,if,not,a,lion,<END>
one,of,the,tigers,spied,the,dwarf,and,said,something,that,made,the,others,laugh,<END>
as,they,reached,the,gate,he,pulled,off,his,clawed,gauntlet,and,the,sweaty,glove,beneath,locked,one,arm,around,the,dwarf's,neck,and,roughly,rubbed,his,head,<END>
tyrion,was,too,startled,to,resist,<END>
it,was,all,over,in,a,heartbeat,<END>
was,there,some,reason,for,that,<END>
he,demanded,of,the,halfmaester,<END>
he,says,that,it,is,good,luck,to,rub,the,head,of,a,dwarf,haldon,said,after,an,exchange,with,the,guard,in,his,own,tongue,<END>
tyrion,forced,himself,to,smile,at,the,man,<END>
tell,him,that,it,is,even,better,luck,to,suck,on,a,dwarf's,cock,<END>
best,not,<END>
tigers,have,been,known,to,have,sharp,teeth,<END>
a,different,guard,motioned,them,through,the,gate,waving,a,torch,at,them,impatiently,<END>
haldon,halfmaester,led,the,way,into,selhorys,proper,with,tyrion,waddling,warily,at,his,heels,<END>
a,great,square,opened,up,before,them,<END>
even,at,this,hour,it,was,crowded,and,noisy,and,ablaze,with,light,<END>
lanterns,swung,from,iron,chains,above,the,doors,of,inns,and,pleasure,houses,but,within,the,gates,they,were,made,of,colored,glass,not,parchment,<END>
to,their,right,a,nightfire,burned,outside,a,temple,of,red,stone,<END>
a,priest,in,scarlet,robes,stood,on,the,temple,balcony,haranguing,the,small,crowd,that,had,gathered,around,the,flames,<END>
elsewhere,travelers,sat,playing,cyvasse,in,front,of,an,inn,drunken,soldiers,wandered,in,and,out,of,what,was,obviously,a,brothel,a,woman,beat,a,mule,outside,a,stable,<END>
a,twowheeled,cart,went,rumbling,past,them,pulled,by,a,white,dwarf,elephant,<END>
this,is,another,world,thought,tyrion,but,not,so,different,from,the,world,i,know,<END>
the,square,was,dominated,by,a,white,marble,statue,of,a,headless,man,in,impossibly,ornate,armor,astride,a,warhorse,similarly,arrayed,<END>
who,might,that,be,<END>
wondered,tyrion,<END>
triarch,horonno,<END>
a,volantene,hero,from,the,century,of,blood,<END>
he,was,returned,as,triarch,every,year,for,forty,years,until,he,wearied,of,elections,and,declared,himself,triarch,for,life,<END>
the,volantenes,were,not,amused,<END>
he,was,put,to,death,soon,after,<END>
tied,between,two,elephants,and,torn,in,half,<END>
his,statue,seems,to,lack,a,head,<END>
he,was,a,tiger,<END>
when,the,elephants,came,to,power,their,followers,went,on,a,rampage,knocking,the,heads,from,the,statues,of,those,they,blamed,for,all,the,wars,and,deaths,<END>
he,shrugged,<END>
that,was,another,age,<END>
come,we'd,best,hear,what,that,priest,is,going,on,about,<END>
i,swear,i,heard,the,name,daenerys,<END>
across,the,square,they,joined,the,growing,throng,outside,the,red,temple,<END>
with,the,locals,towering,above,him,on,every,hand,the,little,man,found,it,hard,to,see,much,beyond,their,arses,<END>
he,could,hear,most,every,word,the,priest,was,saying,but,that,was,not,to,say,he,understood,them,<END>
do,you,understand,what,he,is,saying,<END>
he,asked,haldon,in,the,common,tongue,<END>
i,would,if,i,did,not,have,a,dwarf,piping,in,my,ear,<END>
i,do,not,pipe,<END>
tyrion,crossed,his,arms,and,looked,behind,him,studying,the,faces,of,the,men,and,women,who,had,stopped,to,listen,<END>
everywhere,he,turned,he,saw,tattoos,<END>
slaves,<END>
four,of,every,five,of,them,are,slaves,<END>
the,priest,is,calling,on,the,volantenes,to,go,to,war,the,halfmaester,told,him,but,on,the,side,of,right,as,soldiers,of,the,lord,of,light,r'hllor,who,made,the,sun,and,stars,and,fights,eternally,against,the,darkness,<END>
nyessos,and,malaquo,have,turned,away,from,the,light,he,says,their,hearts,darkened,by,the,yellow,harpies,from,the,east,<END>

asked,tyrion,<END>
the,crowd,was,growing,thicker,<END>
he,could,feel,them,pressing,in,around,them,<END>
who,is,benerro,<END>
haldon,raised,an,eyebrow,<END>
high,priest,of,the,red,temple,in,volantis,<END>
flame,of,truth,light,of,wisdom,first,servant,of,the,lord,of,light,slave,of,r'hllor,<END>
the,only,red,priest,tyrion,had,ever,known,was,thoros,of,myr,the,portly,genial,winestained,roisterer,who,had,loitered,about,robert's,court,swilling,the,king's,finest,vintages,and,setting,his,sword,on,fire,for,mêlées,<END>
give,me,priests,who,are,fat,and,corrupt,and,cynical,he,told,haldon,the,sort,who,like,to,sit,on,soft,satin,cushions,nibble,sweetmeats,and,diddle,little,boys,<END>
it's,the,ones,who,believe,in,gods,who,make,the,trouble,<END>
it,may,be,that,we,can,use,this,trouble,to,our,advantage,<END>
i,know,where,we,may,find,answers,<END>
haldon,led,them,past,the,headless,hero,to,where,a,big,stone,inn,fronted,on,the,square,<END>
the,ridged,shell,of,some,immense,turtle,hung,above,its,door,painted,in,garish,colors,<END>
inside,a,hundred,dim,red,candles,burned,like,distant,stars,<END>
the,air,was,fragrant,with,the,smell,of,roasted,meat,and,spices,and,a,slave,girl,with,a,turtle,on,one,cheek,was,pouring,pale,green,wine,<END>
haldon,paused,in,the,doorway,<END>
there,<END>
those,two,<END>
in,the,alcove,two,men,sat,over,a,carved,stone,cyvasse,table,squinting,at,their,pieces,by,the,light,of,a,red,candle,<END>
one,was,gaunt,and,sallow,with,thinning,black,hair,and,a,blade,of,a,nose,<END>
the,other,was,wide,of,shoulder,and,round,of,belly,with,corkscrew,ringlets,tumbling,past,his,collar,<END>
neither,deigned,to,look,up,from,their,game,until,haldon,drew,up,a,chair,between,them,and,said,my,dwarf,plays,better,cyvasse,than,both,of,you,combined,<END>
the,bigger,man,raised,his,eyes,to,gaze,at,the,intruders,in,distaste,and,said,something,in,the,tongue,of,old,volantis,too,fast,for,tyrion,to,hope,to,follow,<END>
the,thinner,one,leaned,back,in,his,chair,<END>
is,he,for,sale,<END>

a,blunder,said,tyrion,<END>
he,had,as,well,play,his,part,<END>
just,so,the,thin,man,said,<END>
he,answered,with,his,own,heavy,horse,<END>
a,flurry,of,quick,moves,followed,until,finally,the,thin,man,smiled,and,said,death,my,friend,<END>
the,big,man,glowered,at,the,board,then,rose,and,growled,something,in,his,own,tongue,<END>
his,opponent,laughed,<END>

the,dwarf,does,not,stink,as,bad,as,that,<END>
he,beckoned,tyrion,toward,the,empty,chair,<END>
up,with,you,little,man,<END>

sweet,<END>
qavo,laughed,<END>
if,even,half,the,stories,coming,back,from,slaver's,bay,are,true,this,child,is,a,monster,<END>
they,say,that,she,is,bloodthirsty,that,those,who,speak,against,her,are,impaled,on,spikes,to,die,lingering,deaths,<END>

she,gives,her,body,to,men,to,take,their,souls,in,thrall,<END>

this,arrogant,child,has,taken,it,upon,herself,to,smash,the,slave,trade,but,that,traffic,was,never,confined,to,slaver's,bay,<END>
it,was,part,of,the,sea,of,trade,that,spanned,the,world,and,the,dragon,queen,has,clouded,the,water,<END>

the,meat,was,spiced,and,fragrant,charred,outside,and,red,and,juicy,within,<END>
tyrion,plucked,at,a,piece,<END>
it,was,so,hot,it,burned,his,fingers,but,so,good,he,could,not,help,but,reach,for,another,chunk,<END>
he,washed,it,down,with,the,pale,green,volantene,liquor,the,closest,thing,he'd,had,to,wine,for,ages,<END>

he,moved,his,catapult,again,closed,his,hand,around,tyrion's,alabaster,dragon,removed,it,from,the,board,<END>
the,rest,was,slaughter,though,the,dwarf,held,on,another,dozen,moves,<END>
the,time,has,come,for,bitter,tears,qavo,said,at,last,scooping,up,the,pile,of,silver,<END>
another,game,<END>
no,need,said,haldon,<END>
my,dwarf,has,had,his,lesson,in,humility,<END>
i,think,it,is,best,we,get,back,to,our,boat,<END>
outside,in,the,square,the,nightfire,was,still,burning,but,the,priest,was,gone,and,the,crowd,was,long,dispersed,<END>
the,glow,of,candles,glimmered,from,the,windows,of,the,brothel,<END>
from,inside,came,the,sound,of,women's,laughter,<END>
the,night,is,still,young,said,tyrion,<END>
qavo,may,not,have,told,us,everything,<END>
and,whores,hear,much,and,more,from,the,men,they,service,<END>
do,you,need,a,woman,so,badly,yollo,<END>
a,man,grows,weary,of,having,no,lovers,but,his,fingers,<END>
selhorys,may,be,where,whores,go,<END>
tysha,might,be,in,there,even,now,with,tears,tattooed,upon,her,cheek,<END>

oh,have,no,fear,on,that,count,<END>
most,women,prefer,to,be,done,with,me,as,quickly,as,they,can,<END>
the,brothel,was,a,modest,one,compared,to,those,the,dwarf,had,been,wont,to,frequent,in,lannisport,and,king's,landing,<END>
the,proprietor,did,not,seem,to,speak,any,tongue,but,that,of,volantis,but,he,understood,the,clank,of,silver,well,enough,and,led,tyrion,through,an,archway,into,a,long,room,that,smelled,of,incense,where,four,bored,slave,girls,were,lounging,about,in,various,states,of,undress,<END>
two,had,seen,at,least,forty,namedays,come,and,go,he,guessed,the,youngest,was,perhaps,fifteen,or,sixteen,<END>
none,was,as,hideous,as,the,whores,he'd,seen,working,the,docks,though,they,fell,well,short,of,beauty,<END>
one,was,plainly,pregnant,<END>
another,was,just,fat,and,sported,iron,rings,in,both,her,nipples,<END>
all,four,had,tears,tattooed,beneath,one,eye,<END>
do,you,have,a,girl,who,speaks,the,tongue,of,westeros,<END>
asked,tyrion,<END>
the,proprietor,squinted,uncomprehending,so,he,repeated,the,question,in,high,valyrian,<END>
this,time,the,man,seemed,to,grasp,a,word,or,three,and,replied,in,volantene,<END>
sunset,girl,was,all,the,dwarf,could,get,out,of,his,answer,<END>
he,took,that,to,mean,a,girl,from,the,sunset,kingdoms,<END>
there,was,only,one,such,in,the,house,and,she,was,not,tysha,<END>
she,had,freckled,cheeks,and,tight,red,curls,upon,her,head,which,gave,promise,of,freckled,breasts,and,red,hair,between,her,legs,<END>
she'll,do,said,tyrion,and,i'll,have,a,flagon,too,<END>
red,wine,with,red,flesh,<END>
the,whore,was,looking,at,his,noseless,face,with,revulsion,in,her,eyes,<END>
do,i,offend,you,sweetling,<END>
i,am,an,offensive,creature,as,my,father,would,be,glad,to,tell,you,if,he,were,not,dead,and,rotting,<END>
though,she,did,look,westerosi,the,girl,spoke,not,a,word,of,the,common,tongue,<END>
perhaps,she,was,captured,by,some,slaver,as,a,child,<END>
her,bedchamber,was,small,but,there,was,a,myrish,carpet,on,the,floor,and,a,mattress,stuffed,with,feathers,in,place,of,straw,<END>
i,have,seen,worse,<END>
will,you,give,me,your,name,<END>
he,asked,as,he,took,a,cup,of,wine,from,her,<END>
no,<END>
the,wine,was,strong,and,sour,and,required,no,translation,<END>
i,suppose,i,shall,settle,for,your,cunt,<END>
he,wiped,his,mouth,with,the,back,of,his,hand,<END>
have,you,ever,bedded,a,monster,before,<END>
now's,as,good,a,time,as,any,<END>
out,of,your,clothes,and,onto,your,back,if,it,please,you,<END>
or,not,<END>
she,looked,at,him,uncomprehending,until,he,took,the,flagon,from,her,hands,and,lifted,her,skirts,up,over,her,head,<END>
after,that,she,understood,what,was,required,of,her,though,she,did,not,prove,the,liveliest,of,partners,<END>
tyrion,had,been,so,long,without,a,woman,that,he,spent,himself,inside,her,on,the,third,thrust,<END>
he,rolled,off,feeling,more,ashamed,than,sated,<END>
this,was,a,mistake,<END>
what,a,wretched,creature,i've,become,<END>
do,you,know,a,woman,by,the,name,of,tysha,<END>
he,asked,as,he,watched,his,seed,dribble,out,of,her,onto,the,bed,<END>
the,whore,did,not,respond,<END>
do,you,know,where,whores,go,<END>
she,did,not,answer,that,one,either,<END>
her,back,was,crisscrossed,by,ridges,of,scar,tissue,<END>
this,girl,is,as,good,as,dead,<END>
i,have,just,fucked,a,corpse,<END>
even,her,eyes,looked,dead,<END>
she,does,not,even,have,the,strength,to,loathe,me,<END>
he,needed,wine,<END>
a,lot,of,wine,<END>
he,seized,the,flagon,with,both,hands,and,raised,it,to,his,lips,<END>
the,wine,ran,red,<END>
down,his,throat,down,his,chin,<END>
it,dripped,from,his,beard,and,soaked,the,feather,bed,<END>
in,the,candlelight,it,looked,as,dark,as,the,wine,that,had,poisoned,joffrey,<END>
when,he,was,done,he,tossed,the,empty,flagon,aside,and,half-rolled,and,halfstaggered,to,the,floor,groping,for,a,chamber,pot,<END>
there,was,none,to,be,found,<END>
his,stomach,heaved,and,he,found,himself,on,his,knees,retching,on,the,carpet,that,wonderful,thick,myrish,carpet,as,comforting,as,lies,<END>
the,whore,cried,out,in,distress,<END>
they,will,blame,her,for,this,he,realized,ashamed,<END>
cut,off,my,head,and,take,it,to,king's,landing,tyrion,urged,her,<END>
my,sister,will,make,a,lady,of,you,and,no,one,will,ever,whip,you,again,<END>
she,did,not,understand,that,either,so,he,shoved,her,legs,apart,crawled,between,them,and,took,her,once,more,<END>
that,much,she,could,comprehend,at,least,<END>
afterward,the,wine,was,done,and,so,was,he,so,he,wadded,up,the,girl's,clothing,and,tossed,it,at,the,door,<END>
she,took,the,hint,and,fled,leaving,him,alone,in,the,darkness,sinking,deeper,into,his,feather,bed,<END>
i,am,stinking,drunk,<END>
he,dare,not,close,his,eyes,for,fear,of,sleep,<END>
beyond,the,veil,of,dream,the,sorrows,were,waiting,for,him,<END>
stone,steps,ascending,endlessly,steep,and,slick,and,treacherous,and,somewhere,at,the,top,the,shrouded,lord,<END>
i,do,not,want,to,meet,the,shrouded,lord,<END>
tyrion,fumbled,back,into,his,clothes,again,and,groped,his,way,to,the,stair,<END>
griff,will,flay,me,<END>
well,why,not,<END>
if,ever,a,dwarf,deserved,a,skinning,i'm,him,<END>
halfway,down,the,steps,he,lost,his,footing,<END>
somehow,he,managed,to,break,his,tumble,with,his,hands,and,turn,it,into,a,clumsy,thumping,cartwheel,<END>
the,whores,in,the,room,below,looked,up,in,astonishment,when,he,landed,at,the,foot,of,the,steps,<END>
tyrion,rolled,onto,his,feet,and,gave,them,a,bow,<END>
i,am,more,agile,when,i'm,drunk,<END>
he,turned,to,the,proprietor,<END>
i,fear,i,ruined,your,carpet,<END>
the,girl's,not,to,blame,<END>
let,me,pay,<END>
he,pulled,out,a,fistful,of,coins,and,tossed,them,at,the,man,<END>
imp,a,deep,voice,said,behind,him,<END>
in,the,corner,of,the,room,a,man,sat,in,a,pool,of,shadow,with,a,whore,squirming,on,his,lap,<END>
i,never,saw,that,girl,<END>
if,i,had,i,would,have,taken,her,upstairs,instead,of,freckles,<END>
she,was,younger,than,the,others,slim,and,pretty,with,long,silvery,hair,<END>
lyseni,at,a,guess,but,the,man,whose,lap,she,filled,was,from,the,seven,kingdoms,<END>
burly,and,broad-shouldered,forty,if,he,was,a,day,and,maybe,older,<END>
half,his,head,was,bald,but,coarse,stubble,covered,his,cheeks,and,chin,and,hair,grew,thickly,down,his,arms,sprouting,even,from,his,knuckles,<END>
tyrion,did,not,like,the,look,of,him,<END>
he,liked,the,big,black,bear,on,his,surcoat,even,less,<END>
wool,<END>
he's,wearing,wool,in,this,heat,<END>
who,else,but,a,knight,would,be,so,fucking,mad,<END>
how,pleasant,to,hear,the,common,tongue,so,far,from,home,he,made,himself,say,but,i,fear,you,have,mistaken,me,<END>
my,name,is,hugor,hill,<END>
may,i,buy,you,a,cup,of,wine,my,friend,<END>
i've,drunk,enough,<END>
the,knight,shoved,his,whore,aside,and,got,to,his,feet,<END>
his,sword,belt,hung,on,a,peg,beside,him,<END>
he,took,it,down,and,drew,his,blade,<END>
steel,whispered,against,leather,<END>
the,whores,were,watching,avidly,candlelight,shining,in,their,eyes,<END>
the,proprietor,had,vanished,<END>
you're,mine,hugor,<END>
tyrion,could,no,more,outrun,him,than,outfight,him,<END>
drunk,as,he,was,he,could,not,even,hope,to,outwit,him,<END>
he,spread,his,hands,<END>
and,what,do,you,mean,to,do,with,me,<END>

oftimes,i,have,heard,you,say,that,you,are,only,a,young,girl,<END>
to,look,at,you,you,still,seem,half,a,child,too,young,and,frail,to,face,such,trials,by,yourself,<END>
you,need,a,king,beside,you,to,help,you,bear,these,burdens,<END>
dany,speared,a,chunk,of,lamb,took,a,bite,from,it,chewed,slowly,<END>
tell,me,can,this,king,puff,his,cheeks,up,and,blow,xaro's,galleys,back,to,qarth,<END>
can,he,clap,his,hands,and,break,the,siege,of,astapor,<END>
can,he,put,food,in,the,bellies,of,my,children,and,bring,peace,back,to,my,streets,<END>
can,you,<END>
the,green,grace,asked,<END>
a,king,is,not,a,god,but,there,is,still,much,that,a,strong,man,might,do,<END>
when,my,people,look,at,you,they,see,a,conqueror,from,across,the,seas,come,to,murder,us,and,make,slaves,of,our,children,<END>
a,king,could,change,that,<END>
a,highborn,king,of,pure,ghiscari,blood,could,reconcile,the,city,to,your,rule,<END>
elsewise,i,fear,your,reign,must,end,as,it,began,in,blood,and,fire,<END>
dany,pushed,her,food,about,her,plate,<END>
and,who,would,the,gods,of,ghis,have,me,take,as,my,king,and,consort,<END>
hizdahr,zo,loraq,galazza,galare,said,firmly,<END>
dany,did,not,trouble,to,feign,surprise,<END>
why,hizdahr,<END>
skahaz,is,noble,born,as,well,<END>
skahaz,is,kandaq,hizdahr,loraq,<END>
your,radiance,will,forgive,me,but,only,one,who,is,not,herself,ghiscari,would,not,understand,the,difference,<END>
oft,have,i,heard,that,yours,is,the,blood,of,aegon,the,conqueror,jaehaerys,the,wise,and,daeron,the,dragon,<END>
the,noble,hizdahr,is,of,the,blood,of,mazdhan,the,magnificent,hazrak,the,handsome,and,zharaq,the,liberator,<END>
his,forebears,are,as,dead,as,mine,<END>
will,hizdahr,raise,their,shades,to,defend,meereen,against,its,enemies,<END>
i,need,a,man,with,ships,and,swords,<END>
you,offer,me,ancestors,<END>
we,are,an,old,people,<END>
ancestors,are,important,to,us,<END>
wed,hizdahr,zo,loraq,and,make,a,son,with,him,a,son,whose,father,is,the,harpy,whose,mother,is,the,dragon,<END>
in,him,the,prophecies,shall,be,fulfilled,and,your,enemies,will,melt,away,like,snow,<END>
he,shall,be,the,stallion,that,mounts,the,world,<END>
dany,knew,how,it,went,with,prophecies,<END>
they,were,made,of,words,and,words,were,wind,<END>
there,would,be,no,son,for,loraq,no,heir,to,unite,dragon,and,harpy,<END>
when,the,sun,rises,in,the,west,and,sets,in,the,east,when,the,seas,go,dry,and,mountains,blow,in,the,wind,like,leaves,<END>
only,then,would,her,womb,quicken,once,again,but,daenerys,targaryen,had,other,children,tens,of,thousands,who,had,hailed,her,as,their,mother,when,she,broke,their,chains,<END>
she,thought,of,stalwart,shield,of,missandei's,brother,of,the,woman,rylona,rhee,who,had,played,the,harp,so,beautifully,<END>
no,marriage,would,ever,bring,them,back,to,life,but,if,a,husband,could,help,end,the,slaughter,then,she,owed,it,to,her,dead,to,marry,<END>
if,i,wed,hizdahr,will,that,turn,skahaz,against,me,<END>
she,trusted,skahaz,more,than,she,trusted,hizdahr,but,the,shavepate,would,be,a,disaster,as,a,king,<END>
he,was,too,quick,to,anger,too,slow,to,forgive,<END>
she,saw,no,gain,in,wedding,a,man,as,hated,as,herself,<END>
hizdahr,was,well,respected,so,far,as,she,could,see,<END>
what,does,my,prospective,husband,think,of,this,<END>
she,asked,the,green,grace,<END>
what,does,he,think,of,me,<END>
your,grace,need,only,ask,him,<END>
the,noble,hizdahr,awaits,below,<END>
send,down,to,him,if,that,is,your,pleasure,<END>
you,presume,too,much,priestess,the,queen,thought,but,she,swallowed,her,anger,and,made,herself,smile,<END>
why,not,<END>
she,sent,for,ser,barristan,and,told,the,old,knight,to,bring,hizdahr,to,her,<END>
it,is,a,long,climb,<END>
have,the,unsullied,help,him,up,<END>
by,the,time,the,nobleman,had,made,the,ascent,the,green,grace,had,finished,eating,<END>
if,it,please,your,magnificence,i,will,take,my,leave,<END>
you,and,the,noble,hizdahr,will,have,many,things,to,discuss,i,do,not,doubt,<END>
the,old,woman,dabbed,a,smear,of,honey,off,her,lips,gave,qezza,and,grazhar,each,a,parting,kiss,upon,the,brow,and,fastened,her,silken,veil,across,her,face,<END>
i,shall,return,to,the,temple,of,the,graces,and,pray,for,the,gods,to,show,my,queen,the,course,of,wisdom,<END>
when,she,was,gone,dany,let,qezza,fill,her,cup,again,dismissed,the,children,and,commanded,that,hizdahr,zo,loraq,be,admitted,to,her,presence,<END>
and,if,he,dares,say,one,word,about,his,precious,fighting,pits,i,may,have,him,thrown,off,the,terrace,<END>
hizdahr,wore,a,plain,green,robe,beneath,a,quilted,vest,<END>
he,bowed,low,when,he,entered,his,face,solemn,<END>
have,you,no,smile,for,me,<END>
dany,asked,him,<END>
am,i,as,fearful,as,all,that,<END>
i,always,grow,solemn,in,the,presence,of,such,beauty,<END>
it,was,a,good,start,<END>
drink,with,me,<END>
dany,filled,his,cup,herself,<END>
you,know,why,you,are,here,<END>
the,green,grace,seems,to,feel,that,if,i,take,you,for,my,husband,all,my,woes,will,vanish,<END>
i,would,never,make,so,bold,a,claim,<END>
men,are,born,to,strive,and,suffer,<END>
our,woes,only,vanish,when,we,die,<END>
i,can,be,of,help,to,you,however,<END>
i,have,gold,and,friends,and,influence,and,the,blood,of,old,ghis,flows,in,my,veins,<END>
though,i,have,never,wed,i,have,two,natural,children,a,boy,and,a,girl,so,i,can,give,you,heirs,<END>
i,can,reconcile,the,city,to,your,rule,and,put,an,end,to,this,nightly,slaughter,in,the,streets,<END>
can,you,<END>
dany,studied,his,eyes,<END>
why,should,the,sons,of,the,harpy,lay,down,their,knives,for,you,<END>
are,you,one,of,them,<END>
no,<END>
would,you,tell,me,if,you,were,<END>
he,laughed,<END>
no,<END>
the,shavepate,has,ways,of,finding,the,truth,<END>
i,do,not,doubt,that,skahaz,would,soon,have,me,confessing,<END>
a,day,with,him,and,i,will,be,one,of,the,harpy's,sons,<END>
two,days,and,i,will,be,the,harpy,<END>
three,and,it,will,turn,out,i,slew,your,father,too,back,in,the,sunset,kingdoms,when,i,was,yet,a,boy,<END>
then,he,will,impale,me,on,a,stake,and,you,can,watch,me,die,but,afterward,the,killings,will,go,on,<END>
hizdahr,leaned,closer,<END>
or,you,can,marry,me,and,let,me,try,to,stop,them,<END>
why,would,you,want,to,help,me,<END>
for,the,crown,<END>
a,crown,would,suit,me,well,i,will,not,deny,that,<END>
it,is,more,than,that,however,<END>
is,it,so,strange,that,i,would,want,to,protect,my,own,people,as,you,protect,your,freedmen,<END>
meereen,cannot,endure,another,war,your,radiance,<END>
that,was,a,good,answer,and,an,honest,one,<END>
i,have,never,wanted,war,<END>
i,defeated,the,yunkai'i,once,and,spared,their,city,when,i,might,have,sacked,it,<END>
i,refused,to,join,king,cleon,when,he,marched,against,them,<END>
even,now,with,astapor,besieged,i,stay,my,hand,<END>
and,qarth,i,have,never,done,the,qartheen,any,harm,not,by,intent,no,but,qarth,is,a,city,of,merchants,and,they,love,the,clink,of,silver,coins,the,gleam,of,yellow,gold,<END>
when,you,smashed,the,slave,trade,the,blow,was,felt,from,westeros,to,asshai,<END>
qarth,depends,upon,its,slaves,<END>
so,too,tolos,new,ghis,lys,tyrosh,volantis,the,list,is,long,my,queen,<END>
let,them,come,<END>
in,me,they,shall,find,a,sterner,foe,than,cleon,<END>
i,would,sooner,perish,fighting,than,return,my,children,to,bondage,<END>
there,may,be,another,choice,<END>
the,yunkai'i,can,be,persuaded,to,allow,all,your,freedmen,to,remain,free,i,believe,if,your,worship,will,agree,that,the,yellow,city,may,trade,and,train,slaves,unmolested,from,this,day,forth,<END>
no,more,blood,need,flow,<END>
save,for,the,blood,of,those,slaves,that,the,yunkai'i,will,trade,and,train,dany,said,but,she,recognized,the,truth,in,his,words,even,so,<END>
it,may,be,that,is,the,best,end,we,can,hope,for,<END>
you,have,not,said,you,love,me,<END>
i,will,if,it,would,please,your,radiance,<END>
that,is,not,the,answer,of,a,man,in,love,<END>
what,is,love,<END>
desire,<END>
no,man,with,all,his,parts,could,ever,look,on,you,and,not,desire,you,daenerys,<END>
that,is,not,why,i,would,marry,you,however,<END>
before,you,came,meereen,was,dying,<END>
our,rulers,were,old,men,with,withered,cocks,and,crones,whose,puckered,cunts,were,dry,as,dust,<END>
they,sat,atop,their,pyramids,sipping,apricot,wine,and,talking,of,the,glories,of,the,old,empire,whilst,the,centuries,slipped,by,and,the,very,bricks,of,the,city,crumbled,all,around,them,<END>
custom,and,caution,had,an,iron,grip,upon,us,till,you,awakened,us,with,fire,and,blood,<END>
a,new,time,has,come,and,new,things,are,possible,<END>
marry,me,<END>
he,is,not,hard,to,look,at,dany,told,herself,and,he,has,a,king's,tongue,<END>
kiss,me,she,commanded,<END>
he,took,her,hand,again,and,kissed,her,fingers,<END>
not,that,way,<END>
kiss,me,as,if,i,were,your,wife,<END>
hizdahr,took,her,by,the,shoulders,as,tenderly,as,if,she,were,a,baby,bird,<END>
leaning,forward,he,pressed,his,lips,to,hers,<END>
his,kiss,was,light,and,dry,and,quick,<END>
dany,felt,no,stirrings,<END>
shall,i,kiss,you,again,<END>
he,asked,when,it,was,over,<END>
no,<END>
on,her,terrace,in,her,bathing,pool,the,little,fish,would,nibble,at,her,legs,as,she,soaked,<END>
even,they,kissed,with,more,fervor,than,hizdahr,zo,loraq,<END>
i,do,not,love,you,<END>
hizdahr,shrugged,<END>
that,may,come,in,time,<END>
it,has,been,known,to,happen,that,way,<END>
not,with,us,she,thought,<END>
not,whilst,daario,is,so,close,<END>
it's,him,i,want,not,you,<END>
one,day,i,will,want,to,return,to,westeros,to,claim,the,seven,kingdoms,that,were,my,father's,<END>
one,day,all,men,must,die,but,it,serves,no,good,to,dwell,on,death,<END>
i,prefer,to,take,each,day,as,it,comes,<END>
dany,folded,her,hands,together,<END>
words,are,wind,even,words,like,love,and,peace,<END>
i,put,more,trust,in,deeds,<END>
in,my,seven,kingdoms,knights,go,on,quests,to,prove,themselves,worthy,of,the,maiden,that,they,love,<END>
they,seek,for,magic,swords,for,chests,of,gold,for,crowns,stolen,from,a,dragon's,hoard,<END>
hizdahr,arched,an,eyebrow,<END>
the,only,dragons,that,i,know,are,yours,and,magic,swords,are,even,scarcer,<END>
i,will,gladly,bring,you,rings,and,crowns,and,chests,of,gold,if,that,is,your,desire,<END>
peace,is,my,desire,<END>
you,say,that,you,can,help,me,end,the,nightly,slaughter,in,my,streets,<END>
i,say,do,it,<END>
put,an,end,to,this,shadow,war,my,lord,<END>
that,is,your,quest,<END>
give,me,ninety,days,and,ninety,nights,without,a,murder,and,i,will,know,that,you,are,worthy,of,a,throne,<END>
can,you,do,that,<END>
hizdahr,looked,thoughtful,<END>
ninety,days,and,ninety,nights,without,a,corpse,and,on,the,ninety-first,we,wed,<END>
perhaps,said,dany,with,a,coy,look,<END>
though,young,girls,have,been,known,to,be,fickle,<END>
i,may,still,want,a,magic,sword,<END>
hizdahr,laughed,<END>
then,you,shall,have,that,too,radiance,<END>
your,wish,is,my,command,<END>
best,tell,your,seneschal,to,begin,making,preparations,for,our,wedding,<END>
nothing,would,please,the,noble,reznak,more,<END>
if,meereen,knew,that,a,wedding,was,in,the,offing,that,alone,might,buy,her,a,few,nights',respite,even,if,hizdahr's,efforts,came,to,naught,<END>
the,shavepate,will,not,be,happy,with,me,but,reznak,mo,reznak,will,dance,for,joy,<END>
dany,did,not,know,which,of,those,concerned,her,more,<END>
she,needed,skahaz,and,the,brazen,beasts,and,she,had,come,to,mistrust,all,of,reznak's,counsel,<END>
beware,the,perfumed,seneschal,<END>
has,reznak,made,common,cause,with,hizdahr,and,the,green,grace,and,set,some,trap,to,snare,me,<END>
no,sooner,had,hizdahr,zo,loraq,taken,his,leave,of,her,than,ser,barristan,appeared,behind,her,in,his,long,white,cloak,<END>
years,of,service,in,the,kingsguard,had,taught,the,white,knight,how,to,remain,unobtrusive,when,she,was,entertaining,but,he,was,never,far,<END>
he,knows,she,saw,at,once,and,he,disapproves,<END>
the,lines,around,his,mouth,had,deepened,<END>
so,she,said,to,him,it,seems,that,i,may,wed,again,<END>
are,you,happy,for,me,ser,<END>
if,that,is,your,command,your,grace,<END>
hizdahr,is,not,the,husband,you,would,have,chosen,for,me,<END>
it,is,not,my,place,to,choose,your,husband,<END>
it,is,not,she,agreed,but,it,is,important,to,me,that,you,should,understand,<END>
my,people,are,bleeding,<END>
dying,<END>
a,queen,belongs,not,to,herself,but,to,the,realm,<END>
marriage,or,carnage,those,are,my,choices,<END>
a,wedding,or,a,war,<END>
your,grace,may,i,speak,frankly,<END>
always,<END>
there,is,a,third,choice,<END>
westeros,<END>
he,nodded,<END>
i,am,sworn,to,serve,your,grace,and,to,keep,you,safe,from,harm,wherever,you,may,go,<END>
my,place,is,by,your,side,whether,here,or,in,king's,landing,but,your,place,is,back,in,westeros,upon,the,iron,throne,that,was,your,father's,<END>
the,seven,kingdoms,will,never,accept,hizdahr,zo,loraq,as,king,<END>
no,more,than,meereen,will,accept,daenerys,targaryen,as,queen,<END>
the,green,grace,has,the,right,of,that,<END>
i,need,a,king,beside,me,a,king,of,old,ghiscari,blood,<END>
elsewise,they,will,always,see,me,as,the,uncouth,barbarian,who,smashed,through,their,gates,impaled,their,kin,on,spikes,and,stole,their,wealth,<END>
in,westeros,you,will,be,the,lost,child,who,returns,to,gladden,her,father's,heart,<END>
your,people,will,cheer,when,you,ride,by,and,all,good,men,will,love,you,<END>
westeros,is,far,away,<END>
lingering,here,will,never,bring,it,any,closer,<END>
the,sooner,we,take,our,leave,of,this,place,i,know,<END>
i,do,<END>
dany,did,not,know,how,to,make,him,see,<END>
she,wanted,westeros,as,much,as,he,did,but,first,she,must,heal,meereen,<END>
ninety,days,is,a,long,time,<END>
hizdahr,may,fail,<END>
and,if,he,does,the,trying,buys,me,time,<END>
time,to,make,alliances,to,strengthen,my,defenses,to,and,if,he,does,not,fail,<END>
what,will,your,grace,do,then,<END>
her,duty,<END>
the,word,felt,cold,upon,her,tongue,<END>
you,saw,my,brother,rhaegar,wed,tell,me,did,he,wed,for,love,or,duty,<END>
the,old,knight,hesitated,<END>
princess,elia,was,a,good,woman,your,grace,<END>
she,was,kind,and,clever,with,a,gentle,heart,and,a,sweet,wit,<END>
i,know,the,prince,was,very,fond,of,her,<END>
fond,thought,dany,<END>
the,word,spoke,volumes,<END>
i,could,become,fond,of,hizdahr,zo,loraq,in,time,<END>
perhaps,<END>
ser,barristan,went,on,<END>
i,saw,your,father,and,your,mother,wed,as,well,<END>
forgive,me,but,there,was,no,fondness,there,and,the,realm,paid,dearly,for,that,my,queen,<END>
why,did,they,wed,if,they,did,not,love,each,other,<END>
your,grandsire,commanded,it,<END>
a,woods,witch,had,told,him,that,the,prince,was,promised,would,be,born,of,their,line,<END>
a,woods,witch,<END>
dany,was,astonished,<END>
she,came,to,court,with,jenny,of,oldstones,<END>
a,stunted,thing,grotesque,to,look,upon,<END>
a,dwarf,most,people,said,though,dear,to,lady,jenny,who,always,claimed,that,she,was,one,of,the,children,of,the,forest,<END>
what,became,of,her,<END>
summerhall,<END>
the,word,was,fraught,with,doom,<END>
dany,sighed,<END>
leave,me,now,<END>
i,am,very,weary,<END>
as,you,command,<END>
ser,barristan,bowed,and,turned,to,go,<END>
but,at,the,door,he,stopped,<END>
forgive,me,<END>
your,grace,has,a,visitor,<END>
shall,i,tell,him,to,return,upon,the,morrow,<END>
who,is,it,<END>
naharis,<END>
the,stormcrows,have,returned,to,the,city,<END>
daario,<END>
her,heart,gave,a,flutter,in,her,chest,<END>
how,long,has,when,did,he,<END>
she,could,not,seem,to,get,the,words,out,<END>
ser,barristan,seemed,to,understand,<END>
your,grace,was,with,the,priestess,when,he,arrived,<END>
i,knew,you,would,not,want,to,be,disturbed,<END>
the,captain's,news,can,wait,until,the,morrow,<END>
no,<END>
how,could,i,ever,hope,to,sleep,knowing,that,my,captain,so,close,<END>
send,him,up,at,once,<END>
and,i,will,have,no,more,need,of,you,this,evening,<END>
i,shall,be,safe,with,daario,<END>
oh,and,send,irri,and,jhiqui,if,you,would,be,so,good,<END>
and,missandei,<END>
i,need,to,change,to,make,myself,beautiful,<END>
she,said,as,much,to,her,handmaids,when,they,came,<END>
what,does,your,grace,wish,to,wear,<END>
asked,missandei,<END>
starlight,and,seafoam,dany,thought,a,wisp,of,silk,that,leaves,my,left,breast,bare,for,daario's,delight,<END>
oh,and,flowers,for,my,hair,<END>
when,first,they,met,the,captain,brought,her,flowers,every,day,all,the,way,from,yunkai,to,meereen,<END>
bring,the,grey,linen,gown,with,the,pearls,on,the,bodice,<END>
oh,and,my,white,lion's,pelt,<END>
she,always,felt,safer,wrapped,in,drogo's,lionskin,<END>
daenerys,received,the,captain,on,her,terrace,seated,on,a,carved,stone,bench,beneath,a,pear,tree,<END>
a,half-moon,floated,in,the,sky,above,the,city,attended,by,a,thousand,stars,<END>
daario,naharis,entered,swaggering,<END>
he,swaggers,even,when,he,is,standing,still,<END>
the,captain,wore,striped,pantaloons,tucked,into,high,boots,of,purple,leather,a,white,silk,shirt,a,vest,of,golden,rings,<END>
his,trident,beard,was,purple,his,flamboyant,mustachios,gold,his,long,curls,equal,parts,of,both,<END>
on,one,hip,he,wore,a,stiletto,on,the,other,a,dothraki,arakh,<END>
bright,queen,he,said,you,have,grown,more,beautiful,in,my,absence,<END>
how,is,this,thing,possible,<END>
the,queen,was,accustomed,to,such,praise,yet,somehow,the,compliment,meant,more,coming,from,daario,than,from,the,likes,of,reznak,xaro,or,hizdahr,<END>
captain,<END>
they,tell,us,you,did,us,good,service,in,lhazar,<END>
i,have,missed,you,so,much,<END>
your,captain,lives,to,serve,his,cruel,queen,<END>
cruel,<END>
moonlight,glimmered,in,his,eyes,<END>
he,raced,ahead,of,all,his,men,to,see,her,face,the,sooner,only,to,be,left,languishing,whilst,she,ate,lamb,and,figs,with,some,dried-up,old,woman,<END>
they,never,told,me,you,were,here,dany,thought,or,i,might,have,played,the,fool,and,sent,for,you,at,once,<END>
i,was,supping,with,the,green,grace,<END>
it,seemed,best,not,to,mention,hizdahr,<END>
i,had,urgent,need,of,her,wise,counsel,<END>
i,have,only,one,urgent,need,daenerys,<END>
shall,i,send,for,food,<END>
you,must,be,hungry,<END>
i,have,not,eaten,in,two,days,but,now,that,i,am,here,it,is,enough,for,me,to,feast,upon,your,beauty,<END>
my,beauty,will,not,fill,up,your,belly,<END>
she,plucked,down,a,pear,and,tossed,it,at,him,<END>
eat,this,<END>
if,my,queen,commands,it,<END>

our,dragon,queen,has,burned,that,plan,to,ash,and,thanks,to,that,fat,fool,in,pentos,we,have,grasped,the,she-dragon,by,the,tail,and,burned,our,fingers,to,the,bone,<END>

as,you,say,she,answered,unhappily,<END>
so,be,it,<END>

her,task,had,been,to,instruct,the,prince,in,the,doctrines,of,the,faith,and,she,had,done,that,<END>

haldon's,horses,did,not,please,him,<END>

with,dothraki,across,the,river,half,the,populace,of,volon,therys,has,decided,they,would,sooner,be,elsewhere,so,horseflesh,grows,more,expensive,every,day,<END>
i,should,have,gone,myself,<END>
after,selhorys,he,had,found,it,difficult,to,put,the,same,trust,in,haldon,as,previously,<END>
he,let,the,dwarf,beguile,him,with,that,glib,tongue,of,his,<END>
let,him,wander,off,into,a,whorehouse,alone,while,he,lingered,like,a,mooncalf,in,the,square,<END>

they,will,do,well,enough,i,suppose,he,told,haldon,<END>
the,camp,is,only,three,miles,south,<END>
the,shy,maid,would,have,gotten,them,there,more,quickly,but,he,preferred,to,keep,harry,strickland,ignorant,of,where,he,and,the,prince,had,been,<END>

that,sort,of,entrance,might,serve,for,a,sellsword,and,his,son,but,not,for,a,great,lord,and,his,prince,<END>
when,the,lad,emerged,from,the,cabin,with,lemore,by,his,side,griff,looked,him,over,carefully,from,head,to,heel,<END>
the,prince,wore,sword,and,dagger,black,boots,polished,to,a,high,sheen,a,black,cloak,lined,with,blood-red,silk,<END>
with,his,hair,washed,and,cut,and,freshly,dyed,a,deep,dark,blue,his,eyes,looked,blue,as,well,<END>

that,dwarf,had,already,planted,enough,doubts,in,his,young,head,<END>
not,every,man,is,what,he,seems,and,a,prince,especially,has,good,cause,to,be,wary,but,go,too,far,down,that,road,and,the,mistrust,can,poison,you,make,you,sour,and,fearful,<END>
king,aerys,was,one,such,<END>
by,the,end,even,rhaegar,saw,that,plain,enough,<END>
you,would,do,best,to,walk,a,middle,course,<END>

the,road,ran,south,beneath,the,high,white,walls,of,volon,therys,for,a,good,half,mile,<END>
then,they,left,the,town,behind,following,the,winding,course,of,the,rhoyne,through,willow,groves,and,poppy,fields,and,past,a,tall,wooden,windmill,whose,blades,creaked,like,old,bones,as,they,turned,<END>

the,tents,stood,in,rows,with,broad,avenues,between,them,<END>
the,latrines,had,been,placed,beside,the,river,so,the,current,would,wash,away,the,wastes,<END>
the,horse,lines,were,to,the,north,and,beyond,them,two,dozen,elephants,grazed,beside,the,water,pulling,up,reeds,with,their,trunks,<END>

tall,battle,standards,of,cloth-of-gold,flapped,atop,lofty,poles,along,the,perimeters,of,the,camp,<END>

griff,had,feared,that,the,company,might,have,grown,lax,under,harry,strickland,who,had,always,seemed,more,concerned,with,making,friends,than,enforcing,discipline,but,it,would,seem,his,worries,had,been,misplaced,<END>
at,the,gate,haldon,said,something,to,the,serjeant,of,guards,and,a,runner,was,sent,off,to,find,a,captain,<END>

a,big-bellied,shambling,hulk,of,a,man,the,sellsword,had,a,seamed,face,crisscrossed,with,old,scars,<END>
his,right,ear,looked,as,if,a,dog,had,chewed,on,it,and,his,left,was,missing,<END>

i,thought,the,golden,company,had,standards,<END>
it's,worse,than,that,you,bugger,said,franklyn,flowers,<END>

you,look,awful,even,for,a,man's,been,dead,a,dozen,years,<END>

few,enough,<END>
twelve,years,is,a,long,time,<END>
even,the,men,who'd,ridden,with,him,might,not,recognize,the,exile,lord,jon,connington,of,the,fiery,red,beard,in,the,lined,clean-shaved,face,and,dyed,blue,hair,of,the,sellsword,griff,<END>
so,far,as,most,of,them,were,concerned,connington,had,drunk,himself,to,death,in,lys,after,being,driven,from,the,company,in,disgrace,for,stealing,from,the,war,chest,<END>
the,shame,of,the,lie,still,stuck,in,his,craw,but,varys,had,insisted,it,was,necessary,<END>

then,we'll,see,who's,soon,forgotten,<END>
the,captain-general's,tent,was,made,of,cloth-of-gold,and,surrounded,by,a,ring,of,pikes,topped,with,gilded,skulls,<END>
one,skull,was,larger,than,the,rest,grotesquely,malformed,<END>

his,famous,forebear,the,dark,and,dashing,terrence,toyne,of,whom,the,singers,sang,had,been,so,fair,of,face,that,even,the,king's,mistress,could,not,resist,him,but,myles,had,been,possessed,of,jug,ears,a,crooked,jaw,and,the,biggest,nose,that,jon,connington,had,ever,seen,<END>

if,men,think,me,cruel,so,much,the,better,<END>
the,truth,was,otherwise,<END>

death,had,robbed,him,of,his,ears,his,nose,and,all,his,warmth,<END>
the,smile,remained,transformed,into,a,glittering,golden,grin,<END>
all,the,skulls,were,grinning,even,bittersteel's,on,the,tall,pike,in,the,center,<END>
what,does,he,have,to,grin,about,<END>
he,died,defeated,and,alone,a,broken,man,in,an,alien,land,<END>
on,his,deathbed,ser,aegor,rivers,had,famously,commanded,his,men,to,boil,the,flesh,from,his,skull,dip,it,in,gold,and,carry,it,before,them,when,they,crossed,the,sea,to,retake,westeros,<END>
his,successors,had,followed,his,example,<END>

not,all,of,them,are,as,glad,to,see,us,as,they,would,have,me,believe,<END>
he,sensed,knives,behind,some,of,the,smiles,<END>
until,quite,recently,most,of,them,had,believed,that,lord,jon,connington,was,safely,in,his,grave,and,no,doubt,many,felt,that,was,a,fine,place,for,him,a,man,who,would,steal,from,his,brothers-in-arms,<END>

like,many,in,their,trade,they,kept,their,worldly,wealth,upon,their,persons,jeweled,swords,inlaid,armor,heavy,torcs,and,fine,silks,were,much,in,evidence,and,every,man,there,wore,a,lord's,ransom,in,golden,arm,rings,<END>
each,ring,signified,one,year's,service,with,the,golden,company,<END>
marq,mandrake,whose,poxscarred,face,had,a,hole,in,one,cheek,where,a,slave's,mark,had,been,burned,away,wore,a,chain,of,golden,skulls,as,well,<END>
not,every,captain,was,of,westerosi,blood,<END>
black,balaq,a,white-haired,summer,islander,with,skin,dark,as,soot,commanded,the,company's,archers,as,in,blackheart's,day,<END>

the,cadaverous,volantene,gorys,edoryen,had,replaced,strickland,as,paymaster,<END>
a,leopard,skin,was,draped,across,one,shoulder,and,hair,as,red,as,blood,tumbled,to,his,shoulders,in,oiled,ringlets,though,his,pointed,beard,was,black,<END>
the,spymaster,was,new,to,griff,a,lyseni,named,lysono,maar,with,lilac,eyes,and,white-gold,hair,and,lips,that,would,have,been,the,envy,of,a,whore,<END>
at,first,glance,griff,had,almost,taken,him,for,a,woman,<END>
his,fingernails,were,painted,purple,and,his,earlobes,dripped,with,pearls,and,amethysts,<END>
ghosts,and,liars,griff,thought,as,he,surveyed,their,faces,<END>
revenants,from,forgotten,wars,lost,causes,failed,rebellions,a,brotherhood,of,the,failed,and,the,fallen,the,disgraced,and,the,disinherited,<END>
this,is,my,army,<END>
this,is,our,best,hope,<END>
he,turned,to,harry,strickland,<END>
homeless,harry,looked,little,like,a,warrior,<END>
portly,with,a,big,round,head,mild,grey,eyes,and,thinning,hair,that,he,brushed,sideways,to,conceal,a,bald,spot,strickland,sat,in,a,camp,chair,soaking,his,feet,in,a,tub,of,salt,water,<END>
you,will,pardon,me,if,i,do,not,rise,he,said,by,way,of,greeting,<END>
our,march,was,wearisome,and,my,toes,are,prone,to,blisters,<END>
it,is,a,curse,<END>
it,is,a,mark,of,weakness,<END>
you,sound,like,an,old,woman,<END>
the,stricklands,had,been,part,of,the,golden,company,since,its,founding,harry's,great-grandsire,having,lost,his,lands,when,he,rose,with,the,black,dragon,during,the,first,blackfyre,rebellion,<END>
gold,for,four,generations,harry,would,boast,as,if,four,generations,of,exile,and,defeat,were,something,to,take,pride,in,<END>
i,can,make,you,an,ointment,for,that,said,haldon,and,there,are,certain,mineral,salts,that,will,toughen,your,skin,<END>
that,is,kind,of,you,<END>
strickland,beckoned,to,his,squire,<END>
watkyn,wine,for,our,friends,<END>
thank,you,but,no,said,griff,<END>
we,will,drink,water,<END>
as,you,prefer,<END>
the,captain-general,smiled,up,at,the,prince,<END>
and,this,must,be,your,son,<END>
does,he,know,<END>

how,much,did,myles,tell,him,<END>
varys,had,been,adamant,about,the,need,for,secrecy,<END>
the,plans,that,he,and,illyrio,had,made,with,blackheart,had,been,known,to,them,alone,<END>
the,rest,of,the,company,had,been,left,ignorant,<END>
what,they,did,not,know,they,could,not,let,slip,<END>
that,time,was,done,though,<END>
no,man,could,have,asked,for,a,worthier,son,griff,said,but,the,lad,is,not,of,my,blood,and,his,name,is,not,griff,<END>
my,lords,i,give,you,aegon,targaryen,firstborn,son,of,rhaegar,prince,of,dragonstone,by,princess,elia,of,dorne,soon,with,your,help,to,be,aegon,the,sixth,of,his,name,king,of,andals,the,rhoynar,and,the,first,men,and,lord,of,the,seven,kingdoms,<END>
silence,greeted,his,announcement,<END>
someone,cleared,his,throat,<END>
one,of,the,coles,refilled,his,wine,cup,from,the,flagon,<END>
gorys,edoryen,played,with,one,of,his,corkscrew,ringlets,and,murmured,something,in,a,tongue,griff,did,not,know,<END>
laswell,peake,coughed,mandrake,and,lothston,exchanged,a,glance,<END>
they,know,griff,realized,then,<END>
they,have,known,all,along,<END>
he,turned,to,look,at,harry,strickland,<END>
when,did,you,tell,them,<END>
the,captain-general,wriggled,his,blistered,toes,in,his,footbath,<END>
when,we,reached,the,river,<END>
the,company,was,restless,with,good,reason,<END>
we,walked,away,from,an,easy,campaign,in,the,disputed,lands,and,for,what,<END>
so,we,could,swelter,in,this,god-awful,heat,watching,our,coins,melt,away,and,our,blades,go,to,rust,whilst,i,turn,away,rich,contracts,<END>
that,news,made,griff's,skin,crawl,<END>
who,<END>
the,yunkishmen,<END>
the,envoy,that,they,sent,to,woo,volantis,has,already,dispatched,three,free,companies,to,slaver's,bay,<END>
he,wishes,us,to,be,the,fourth,and,offers,twice,what,myr,was,paying,us,plus,a,slave,for,every,man,in,the,company,ten,for,every,officer,and,a,hundred,choice,maidens,all,for,me,<END>
bloody,hell,<END>
that,would,require,thousands,of,slaves,<END>
where,do,the,yunkishmen,expect,to,find,so,many,<END>
in,meereen,<END>
strickland,beckoned,to,his,squire,<END>
watkyn,a,towel,<END>
this,water's,growing,cool,and,my,toes,have,wrinkled,up,like,raisins,<END>
no,not,that,towel,the,soft,one,<END>
you,refused,him,said,griff,<END>
i,told,him,i,would,think,on,his,proposal,<END>
harry,winced,as,his,squire,toweled,his,feet,<END>
gentle,with,the,toes,<END>
think,of,them,as,thin-skinned,grapes,lad,<END>
you,want,to,dry,them,without,crushing,them,<END>
pat,do,not,scrub,<END>
yes,like,that,<END>
he,turned,back,to,griff,<END>
a,blunt,refusal,would,have,been,unwise,<END>
the,men,might,rightly,ask,if,i,had,taken,leave,of,my,wits,<END>
you,will,have,work,for,your,blades,soon,enough,<END>
will,we,<END>
asked,lysono,maar,<END>
i,assume,you,know,that,the,targaryen,girl,has,not,started,for,the,west,<END>
we,heard,that,tale,in,selhorys,<END>
no,tale,<END>
simple,truth,<END>
the,why,of,it,is,harder,to,grasp,<END>
sack,meereen,aye,why,not,<END>
i,would,have,done,the,same,in,her,place,<END>
the,slaver,cities,reek,of,gold,and,conquest,requires,coin,<END>
but,why,linger,<END>
fear,<END>
madness,<END>
sloth,<END>
the,why,of,it,does,not,matter,<END>
harry,strickland,unrolled,a,pair,of,striped,woolen,stockings,<END>
she,is,in,meereen,and,we,are,here,where,the,volantenes,grow,daily,more,unhappy,with,our,presence,<END>
we,came,to,raise,up,a,king,and,queen,who,would,lead,us,home,to,westeros,but,this,targaryen,girl,seems,more,intent,on,planting,olive,trees,than,in,reclaiming,her,father's,throne,<END>
meanwhile,her,foes,gather,<END>
yunkai,new,ghis,tolos,<END>
bloodbeard,and,the,tattered,prince,will,both,be,in,the,field,against,her,and,soon,enough,the,fleets,of,old,volantis,will,descend,on,her,as,well,<END>
what,does,she,have,<END>
bedslaves,with,sticks,<END>
unsullied,said,griff,<END>
and,dragons,<END>
dragons,aye,the,captain-general,said,but,young,ones,hardly,more,than,hatchlings,<END>
strickland,eased,his,sock,over,his,blisters,and,up,his,ankle,<END>
how,much,will,they,avail,her,when,all,these,armies,close,about,her,city,like,a,fist,<END>
tristan,rivers,drummed,his,fingers,on,his,knee,<END>
all,the,more,reason,that,we,must,reach,her,quickly,i,say,<END>
if,daenerys,will,not,come,to,us,we,must,go,to,daenerys,<END>
can,we,walk,across,the,waves,ser,<END>
asked,lysono,maar,<END>
i,tell,you,again,we,cannot,reach,the,silver,queen,by,sea,<END>
i,slipped,into,volantis,myself,posing,as,a,trader,to,learn,how,many,ships,might,be,available,to,us,<END>
the,harbor,teems,with,galleys,cogs,and,carracks,of,every,sort,and,size,yet,even,so,i,soon,found,myself,consorting,with,smugglers,and,pirates,<END>
we,have,ten,thousand,men,in,the,company,as,i,am,sure,lord,connington,remembers,from,his,years,of,service,with,us,<END>
five,hundred,knights,each,with,three,horses,<END>
five,hundred,squires,with,one,mount,apiece,<END>
and,elephants,we,must,not,forget,the,elephants,<END>
a,pirate,ship,will,not,suffice,<END>
we,would,need,a,pirate,fleet,and,even,if,we,found,one,the,word,has,come,back,from,slaver's,bay,that,meereen,has,been,closed,off,by,blockade,<END>
we,could,feign,acceptance,of,the,yunkish,offer,urged,gorys,edoryen,<END>
allow,the,yunkai'i,to,transport,us,to,the,east,then,return,their,gold,beneath,the,walls,of,meereen,<END>
one,broken,contract,is,stain,enough,upon,the,honor,of,the,company,<END>
homeless,harry,strickland,paused,with,his,blistered,foot,in,hand,<END>
let,me,remind,you,it,was,myles,toyne,who,put,his,seal,to,this,secret,pact,not,me,<END>
i,would,honor,his,agreement,if,i,could,but,how,<END>
it,seems,plain,to,me,that,the,targaryen,girl,is,never,coming,west,<END>
westeros,was,her,father's,kingdom,<END>
meereen,is,hers,<END>
if,she,can,break,the,yunkai'i,she'll,be,queen,of,slaver's,bay,<END>
if,not,she'll,die,long,before,we,could,hope,to,reach,her,<END>
his,words,came,as,no,surprise,to,griff,<END>
harry,strickland,had,always,been,a,genial,man,better,at,hammering,out,contracts,than,at,hammering,on,foes,<END>
he,had,a,nose,for,gold,but,whether,he,had,the,belly,for,battle,was,another,question,<END>
there,is,the,land,route,suggested,franklyn,flowers,<END>
the,demon,road,is,death,<END>
we,will,lose,half,the,company,to,desertion,if,we,attempt,that,march,and,bury,half,of,those,who,remain,beside,the,road,<END>
it,grieves,me,to,say,it,but,magister,illyrio,and,his,friends,may,have,been,unwise,to,put,so,much,hope,on,this,child,queen,<END>
no,thought,griff,but,they,were,most,unwise,to,put,their,hopes,on,you,<END>
and,then,prince,aegon,spoke,<END>
then,put,your,hopes,on,me,he,said,<END>
daenerys,is,prince,rhaegar's,sister,but,i,am,rhaegar's,son,<END>
i,am,the,only,dragon,that,you,need,<END>
griff,put,a,black-gloved,hand,upon,prince,aegon's,shoulder,<END>
spoken,boldly,he,said,but,think,what,you,are,saying,<END>
i,have,the,lad,insisted,<END>
why,should,i,go,running,to,my,aunt,as,if,i,were,a,beggar,<END>
my,claim,is,better,than,her,own,<END>
let,her,come,to,me,in,westeros,<END>
franklyn,flowers,laughed,<END>
i,like,it,<END>
sail,west,not,east,<END>
leave,the,little,queen,to,her,olives,and,seat,prince,aegon,upon,the,iron,throne,<END>
the,boy,has,stones,give,him,that,<END>
the,captain-general,looked,as,if,someone,had,slapped,his,face,<END>
has,the,sun,curdled,your,brains,flowers,<END>
we,need,the,girl,<END>
we,need,the,marriage,<END>
if,daenerys,accepts,our,princeling,and,takes,him,for,her,consort,the,seven,kingdoms,will,do,the,same,<END>
without,her,the,lords,will,only,mock,his,claim,and,brand,him,a,fraud,and,a,pretender,<END>
and,how,do,you,propose,to,get,to,westeros,<END>
you,heard,lysono,<END>
there,are,no,ships,to,be,had,<END>
this,man,is,afraid,to,fight,griff,realized,<END>
how,could,they,have,chosen,him,to,take,the,blackheart's,place,<END>
no,ships,for,slaver's,bay,<END>
westeros,is,another,matter,<END>
the,east,is,closed,to,us,not,the,sea,<END>
the,triarchs,would,be,glad,to,see,the,back,of,us,i,do,not,doubt,<END>
they,might,even,help,us,arrange,passage,back,to,the,seven,kingdoms,<END>
no,city,wants,an,army,on,its,doorstep,<END>
he's,not,wrong,said,lysono,maar,<END>
by,now,the,lion,surely,has,the,dragon's,scent,said,one,of,the,coles,but,cersei's,attentions,will,be,fixed,upon,meereen,and,this,other,queen,<END>
she,knows,nothing,of,our,prince,<END>

haldon,halfmaester,had,spoken,of,using,the,red,priest,to,young,griff's,advantage,tyrion,recalled,<END>

that,daenerys,stands,in,peril,<END>
the,dark,eye,has,fallen,upon,her,and,the,minions,of,night,are,plotting,her,destruction,praying,to,their,false,gods,in,temples,of,deceit,conspiring,at,betrayal,with,godless,outlanders,the,hairs,on,the,back,of,tyrion's,neck,began,to,prickle,<END>
prince,aegon,will,find,no,friend,here,<END>
the,red,priest,spoke,of,ancient,prophecy,a,prophecy,that,foretold,the,coming,of,a,hero,to,deliver,the,world,from,darkness,<END>
one,hero,<END>
not,two,<END>
daenerys,has,dragons,aegon,does,not,<END>
the,dwarf,did,not,need,to,be,a,prophet,himself,to,foresee,how,benerro,and,his,followers,might,react,to,a,second,targaryen,<END>
griff,will,see,that,too,surely,he,thought,surprised,to,find,how,much,he,cared,<END>
the,knight,had,forced,their,way,through,most,of,the,press,at,the,back,of,the,plaza,ignoring,the,curses,that,were,flung,at,them,as,they,passed,<END>
one,man,stepped,in,front,of,them,but,his,captor,gripped,the,hilt,of,his,longsword,and,drew,it,just,far,enough,to,show,a,foot,of,naked,steel,<END>
the,man,melted,away,and,all,at,once,an,alley,opened,up,before,them,<END>
the,knight,urged,his,mount,to,a,trot,and,they,left,the,crowd,behind,them,<END>
for,a,while,tyrion,could,still,hear,benerro's,voice,growing,fainter,at,their,back,and,the,roars,his,words,provoked,sudden,as,thunder,<END>
they,came,upon,a,stable,<END>
the,knight,dismounted,then,hammered,on,the,door,until,a,haggard,slave,with,a,horsehead,on,his,cheek,came,running,<END>
the,dwarf,was,pulled,down,roughly,from,the,saddle,and,lashed,to,a,post,whilst,his,captor,woke,the,stable's,owner,and,haggled,with,him,over,the,price,of,his,horse,and,saddle,<END>
cheaper,to,sell,a,horse,than,to,ship,one,half,across,the,world,<END>
tyrion,sensed,a,ship,in,his,immediate,future,<END>
perhaps,he,was,a,prophet,after,all,<END>
when,the,dickering,was,done,the,knight,slung,his,weapons,shield,and,saddlebag,over,his,shoulder,and,asked,for,directions,to,the,nearest,smithy,<END>
that,proved,shuttered,too,but,opened,quick,enough,at,the,knight's,shout,<END>
the,smith,gave,tyrion,a,squint,then,nodded,and,accepted,a,fistful,of,coins,<END>
come,here,the,knight,told,his,prisoner,<END>
he,drew,his,dagger,and,slit,tyrion's,bonds,apart,<END>
my,thanks,said,the,dwarf,as,he,rubbed,his,wrists,but,the,knight,only,laughed,and,said,save,your,gratitude,for,someone,who,deserves,it,imp,<END>
you,will,not,like,this,next,bit,<END>
he,was,not,wrong,<END>
the,manacles,were,black,iron,thick,and,heavy,each,weighing,a,good,two,pounds,if,the,dwarf,was,any,judge,<END>
the,chains,added,even,more,weight,<END>
i,must,be,more,fearsome,than,i,knew,tyrion,confessed,as,the,last,links,were,hammered,closed,<END>
each,blow,sent,a,shock,up,his,arm,almost,to,the,shoulder,<END>
or,were,you,afraid,that,i,would,dash,away,on,these,stunted,little,legs,of,mine,<END>
the,ironsmith,did,not,so,much,as,look,up,from,his,work,but,the,knight,chuckled,darkly,<END>
it's,your,mouth,that,concerns,me,not,your,legs,<END>
in,fetters,you're,a,slave,<END>
no,one,will,listen,to,a,word,you,say,not,even,those,who,speak,the,tongue,of,westeros,<END>
there's,no,need,for,this,tyrion,protested,<END>
i,will,be,a,good,little,prisoner,i,will,i,<END>
will,<END>
prove,it,then,and,shut,your,mouth,<END>
so,he,bowed,his,head,and,bit,his,tongue,as,the,chains,were,fixed,wrist,to,wrist,wrist,to,ankle,ankle,to,ankle,<END>
these,bloody,things,weigh,more,than,i,do,<END>
still,at,least,he,drew,breath,<END>
his,captor,could,just,as,easily,have,cut,his,head,off,<END>
that,was,all,cersei,required,after,all,<END>
not,striking,it,off,straightaway,had,been,his,captor's,first,mistake,<END>
there,is,half,a,world,between,volantis,and,king's,landing,and,much,and,more,can,happen,along,the,way,ser,<END>
the,rest,of,the,way,they,went,by,foot,tyrion,clanking,and,clattering,as,he,struggled,to,keep,up,with,his,captor's,long,impatient,strides,<END>
whenever,he,threatened,to,fall,behind,the,knight,would,seize,his,fetters,and,yank,them,roughly,sending,the,dwarf,stumbling,and,hopping,along,beside,him,<END>
it,could,be,worse,<END>
he,could,be,urging,me,along,with,a,whip,<END>
volantis,straddled,one,mouth,of,the,rhoyne,where,the,river,kissed,the,sea,its,two,halves,joined,by,the,long,bridge,<END>
the,oldest,richest,part,of,the,city,was,east,of,the,river,but,sellswords,barbarians,and,other,uncouth,outlanders,were,not,welcome,there,so,they,must,needs,cross,over,to,the,west,<END>
the,gateway,to,the,long,bridge,was,a,black,stone,arch,carved,with,sphinxes,manticores,dragons,and,creatures,stranger,still,<END>
beyond,the,arch,stretched,the,great,span,that,the,valyrians,had,built,at,the,height,of,their,glory,its,fused,stone,roadway,supported,by,massive,piers,<END>
the,road,was,just,wide,enough,for,two,carts,to,pass,abreast,so,whenever,a,wagon,headed,west,passed,one,going,east,both,had,to,slow,to,a,crawl,<END>
it,was,well,they,were,afoot,<END>
a,third,of,the,way,out,a,wagon,laden,with,melons,had,gotten,its,wheels,tangled,with,one,piled,high,with,silken,carpets,and,brought,all,wheeled,traffic,to,a,halt,<END>
much,of,the,foot,traffic,had,stopped,as,well,to,watch,the,drivers,curse,and,scream,at,one,another,but,the,knight,grabbed,hold,of,tyrion's,chain,and,bulled,a,path,through,the,throng,for,both,of,them,<END>
in,the,middle,of,the,press,a,boy,tried,to,reach,into,his,purse,but,a,hard,elbow,put,an,end,to,that,and,spread,the,thief's,bloody,nose,across,half,his,face,<END>
buildings,rose,to,either,side,of,them,shops,and,temples,taverns,and,inns,cyvasse,parlors,and,brothels,<END>
most,were,three,or,four,stories,tall,each,floor,overhanging,the,one,beneath,it,<END>
their,top,floors,almost,kissed,<END>
crossing,the,bridge,felt,like,passing,through,a,torchlit,tunnel,<END>
along,the,span,were,shops,and,stalls,of,every,sort,weavers,and,lacemakers,displayed,their,wares,cheek,by,jowl,with,glassblowers,candlemakers,and,fishwives,selling,eels,and,oysters,<END>
each,goldsmith,had,a,guard,at,his,door,and,every,spicer,had,two,for,their,goods,were,twice,as,valuable,<END>
here,and,there,between,the,shops,a,traveler,might,catch,a,glimpse,of,the,river,he,was,crossing,<END>
to,the,north,the,rhoyne,was,a,broad,black,ribbon,bright,with,stars,five,times,as,wide,as,the,blackwater,rush,at,king's,landing,<END>
south,of,the,bridge,the,river,opened,up,to,embrace,the,briny,sea,<END>
at,the,bridge's,center,span,the,severed,hands,of,thieves,and,cutpurses,hung,like,strings,of,onions,from,iron,stanchions,along,the,roadway,<END>
three,heads,were,on,display,as,well,two,men,and,a,woman,their,crimes,scrawled,on,tablets,underneath,them,<END>
a,pair,of,spearmen,attended,them,clad,in,polished,helms,and,shirts,of,silver,mail,<END>
across,their,cheeks,were,tiger,stripes,as,green,as,jade,<END>
from,time,to,time,the,guards,waved,their,spears,to,chase,away,the,kestrels,gulls,and,carrion,crows,paying,court,to,the,deceased,<END>
the,birds,returned,to,the,heads,within,moments,<END>
what,did,they,do,<END>
tyrion,inquired,innocently,<END>
the,knight,glanced,at,the,inscriptions,<END>
the,woman,was,a,slave,who,raised,her,hand,to,her,mistress,<END>
the,older,man,was,accused,of,fomenting,rebellion,and,spying,for,the,dragon,queen,<END>
and,the,young,one,<END>
killed,his,father,<END>
tyrion,gave,the,rotting,head,a,second,look,<END>
why,it,almost,looks,as,if,those,lips,are,smiling,<END>
farther,on,the,knight,paused,briefly,to,consider,a,jeweled,tiara,displayed,upon,a,bed,of,purple,velvet,<END>
he,passed,that,by,but,a,few,steps,on,he,stopped,again,to,haggle,over,a,pair,of,gloves,at,a,leatherworker's,stall,<END>
tyrion,was,grateful,for,the,respites,<END>
the,headlong,pace,had,left,him,puffing,and,his,wrists,were,chafed,raw,from,the,manacles,<END>
from,the,far,end,of,the,long,bridge,it,was,only,a,short,walk,through,the,teeming,waterfront,districts,of,the,west,bank,down,torchlit,streets,crowded,with,sailors,slaves,and,drunken,merrymakers,<END>
once,an,elephant,lumbered,past,with,a,dozen,half-naked,slave,girls,waving,from,the,castle,on,its,back,teasing,passersby,with,glimpses,of,their,breasts,and,crying,malaquo,malaquo,<END>
they,made,such,an,entrancing,sight,that,tyrion,almost,waddled,right,into,the,steaming,pile,of,dung,the,elephant,had,left,to,mark,its,passage,<END>
he,was,saved,at,the,last,instant,when,the,knight,snatched,him,aside,yanking,on,his,chain,so,hard,it,made,him,reel,and,stumble,<END>
how,much,farther,<END>
the,dwarf,asked,<END>
just,there,<END>
fishmonger's,square,<END>
their,destination,proved,to,be,the,merchant's,house,a,four-story,monstrosity,that,squatted,amongst,the,warehouses,brothels,and,taverns,of,the,waterside,like,some,enormous,fat,man,surrounded,by,children,<END>
its,common,room,was,larger,than,the,great,halls,of,half,the,castles,in,westeros,a,dim-lit,maze,of,a,place,with,a,hundred,private,alcoves,and,hidden,nooks,whose,blackened,beams,and,cracked,ceilings,echoed,to,the,din,of,sailors,traders,captains,money,changers,shippers,and,slavers,lying,cursing,and,cheating,each,other,in,half,a,hundred,different,tongues,<END>
tyrion,approved,the,choice,of,hostelry,<END>
soon,or,late,the,shy,maid,must,reach,volantis,<END>
this,was,the,city's,biggest,inn,first,choice,for,shippers,captains,and,merchantmen,<END>
a,lot,of,business,was,done,in,that,cavernous,warren,of,a,common,room,<END>
he,knew,enough,of,volantis,to,know,that,<END>
let,griff,turn,up,here,with,duck,and,haldon,and,he,would,be,free,again,soon,enough,<END>
meanwhile,he,would,be,patient,<END>
his,chance,would,come,<END>
the,rooms,upstairs,proved,rather,less,than,grand,however,particularly,the,cheap,ones,up,on,the,fourth,floor,<END>
wedged,into,a,corner,of,the,building,beneath,a,sloping,roof,the,bedchamber,his,captor,had,engaged,featured,a,low,ceiling,a,sagging,feather,bed,with,an,unpleasant,odor,and,a,slanting,wood-plank,floor,that,reminded,tyrion,of,his,sojourn,at,the,eyrie,<END>
at,least,this,room,has,walls,<END>
it,had,windows,too,those,were,its,chief,amenity,along,with,the,iron,ring,set,in,the,wall,so,useful,for,chaining,up,one's,slaves,<END>
his,captor,paused,only,long,enough,to,light,a,tallow,candle,before,securing,tyrion's,chains,to,the,ring,<END>
must,you,<END>
the,dwarf,protested,rattling,feebly,<END>
where,am,i,going,to,go,out,the,window,<END>
you,might,<END>
we,are,four,floors,up,and,i,cannot,fly,<END>

cersei,is,not,like,to,care,<END>
tyrion,rattled,his,chains,<END>
i,know,who,you,are,ser,<END>
it,had,not,been,hard,to,puzzle,out,<END>
the,bear,on,his,surcoat,the,arms,on,his,shield,the,lost,lordship,he,had,mentioned,<END>
i,know,what,you,are,<END>
and,if,you,know,who,i,am,you,also,know,that,i,was,the,king's,hand,and,sat,in,council,with,the,spider,<END>
would,it,interest,you,to,know,that,it,was,the,eunuch,who,dispatched,me,on,this,journey,<END>
him,and,jaime,but,i'll,leave,my,brother,out,of,it,<END>
i,am,as,much,his,creature,as,you,are,<END>
we,ought,not,be,at,odds,<END>
that,did,not,please,the,knight,<END>

all,my,sister,requires,is,my,head,and,you,have,a,fine,sharp,sword,<END>
why,not,end,this,farce,now,and,spare,us,both,<END>
the,knight,laughed,<END>
is,this,some,dwarf's,trick,<END>
beg,for,death,in,hopes,i'll,let,you,live,<END>
he,went,to,the,door,<END>
i'll,bring,you,something,from,the,kitchens,<END>
how,kind,of,you,<END>
i'll,wait,here,<END>
i,know,you,will,<END>
yet,when,the,knight,left,he,locked,the,door,behind,him,with,a,heavy,iron,key,<END>
the,merchant's,house,was,famous,for,its,locks,<END>
as,secure,as,a,gaol,the,dwarf,thought,bitterly,but,at,least,there,are,those,windows,<END>
tyrion,knew,that,the,chances,of,his,escaping,his,chains,were,little,and,less,but,even,so,he,felt,obliged,to,try,<END>
his,efforts,to,slip,a,hand,through,the,manacle,served,only,to,scrap,off,more,skin,and,leave,his,wrist,slick,with,blood,and,all,his,tugging,or,twisting,could,not,pull,the,iron,ring,from,the,wall,<END>
bugger,this,he,thought,slumping,back,as,far,as,his,chains,would,allow,<END>
his,legs,had,begun,to,cramp,<END>
this,was,going,to,be,a,hellishly,uncomfortable,night,<END>
the,first,of,many,i,do,not,doubt,<END>
the,room,was,stifling,so,the,knight,had,opened,the,shutters,to,let,in,a,cross,breeze,<END>
cramped,into,a,corner,of,the,building,under,the,eaves,the,chamber,was,fortunate,in,having,two,windows,<END>
one,looked,toward,the,long,bridge,and,the,black-walled,heart,of,old,volantis,across,the,river,<END>
the,other,opened,on,the,square,below,<END>
fishermonger's,square,mormont,called,it,<END>
as,tight,as,the,chains,were,tyrion,found,he,could,see,out,the,latter,by,leaning,sideways,and,letting,the,iron,ring,support,his,weight,<END>
not,as,long,a,fall,as,the,one,from,lysa,arryn's,sky,cells,but,it,would,leave,me,just,as,dead,<END>
perhaps,if,i,were,drunk,even,at,this,hour,the,square,was,crowded,with,sailors,roistering,whores,prowling,for,custom,and,merchants,going,about,their,business,<END>
a,red,priestess,scurried,past,attended,by,a,dozen,acolytes,with,torches,their,robes,whisking,about,their,ankles,<END>

a,slave,stood,beside,their,table,holding,a,lantern,over,the,board,<END>
tyrion,could,hear,a,woman,singing,<END>
the,words,were,strange,the,tune,was,soft,and,sad,<END>
if,i,knew,what,she,was,singing,i,might,cry,<END>
closer,to,hand,a,crowd,was,gathering,around,a,pair,of,jugglers,throwing,flaming,torches,at,each,other,<END>
his,captor,returned,shortly,carrying,two,tankards,and,a,roasted,duck,<END>
he,kicked,the,door,shut,ripped,the,duck,in,two,and,tossed,half,of,it,to,tyrion,<END>
he,would,have,snatched,it,from,the,air,but,his,chains,brought,him,up,short,when,he,tried,to,lift,his,arms,<END>
instead,the,bird,struck,his,temple,and,slid,hot,and,greasy,down,his,face,and,he,had,to,hunker,down,and,stretch,for,it,with,fetters,clanking,<END>
he,got,it,on,the,third,try,and,tore,into,it,happily,with,his,teeth,<END>

ser,jorah,hung,his,sword,belt,on,a,bedpost,kicked,off,his,boots,pulled,his,chain,mail,over,his,head,and,stripped,out,of,his,wool,and,leather,and,sweat-stained,undertunic,to,reveal,a,scarred,brawny,torso,covered,with,dark,hair,<END>
if,i,could,skin,him,i,could,sell,that,pelt,for,a,fur,cloak,tyrion,thought,as,mormont,tumbled,into,the,slightly,smelly,comfort,of,his,sagging,feather,bed,<END>
in,no,time,at,all,the,knight,was,snoring,leaving,his,prize,alone,with,his,chains,<END>

someone's,about,to,die,thought,tyrion,<END>
his,wrist,was,throbbing,where,he'd,torn,the,skin,and,his,fetters,made,it,impossible,for,him,to,sit,let,alone,stretch,out,<END>
the,best,he,could,do,was,twist,sideways,to,lean,against,the,wall,and,before,long,he,began,to,lose,all,feeling,in,his,hands,<END>
when,he,moved,to,relieve,the,strain,sensation,came,flooding,back,as,pain,<END>
he,had,to,grind,his,teeth,to,keep,from,screaming,<END>

his,sufferings,were,nothing,compared,to,their,own,but,that,did,not,make,him,hurt,any,less,<END>
just,make,it,stop,<END>
ser,jorah,had,rolled,onto,one,side,so,all,that,tyrion,could,see,of,him,was,a,broad,hairy,muscular,back,<END>
even,if,i,could,slip,these,chains,i'd,need,to,climb,over,him,to,reach,his,sword,belt,<END>

exhaustion,finally,overwhelmed,his,pains,and,tyrion,drifted,off,into,a,fitful,sleep,<END>
but,every,time,another,cramp,took,root,inside,his,calf,and,twisted,the,dwarf,would,cry,out,in,his,sleep,trembling,in,his,chains,<END>
he,woke,with,every,muscle,aching,to,find,morning,streaming,through,the,windows,bright,and,golden,as,the,lion,of,lannister,<END>

he,bit,his,lip,and,said,wherever,we're,going,you,will,need,to,roll,me,there,<END>
instead,the,big,knight,carried,him,hoisting,him,by,the,chain,between,his,wrists,<END>
the,common,room,of,the,merchant's,house,was,a,dim,labyrinth,of,alcoves,and,grottoes,built,around,a,central,courtyard,where,a,trellis,of,flowering,vines,threw,intricate,patterns,across,the,flagstone,floor,and,green,and,purple,moss,grew,between,the,stones,<END>

some,tyroshi,trader,<END>
a,gust,of,sound,came,with,him,from,outside,the,cries,of,gulls,a,woman's,laughter,the,voices,of,the,fishmongers,<END>
for,half,a,heartbeat,he,thought,he,glimpsed,illyrio,mopatis,but,it,was,only,one,of,those,white,dwarf,elephants,passing,the,front,door,<END>

you,never,know,who,the,wind,might,blow,in,<END>
my,one,true,love,my,father's,ghost,a,duck,<END>

a,sure,cure,for,constipation,said,tyrion,<END>
just,ask,my,father,<END>
he,reached,for,his,tankard,and,took,a,slow,swallow,to,help,conceal,whatever,might,be,showing,on,his,face,<END>

the,widow,of,the,waterfront,<END>
east,of,the,rhoyne,they,still,call,her,vogarro's,whore,though,never,to,her,face,<END>

an,elephant,seven,times,a,triarch,very,rich,a,power,on,the,docks,<END>
whilst,other,men,built,the,ships,and,sailed,them,he,built,piers,and,storehouses,brokered,cargoes,changed,money,insured,shipowners,against,the,hazards,of,the,sea,<END>
he,dealt,in,slaves,as,well,<END>
when,he,grew,besotted,with,one,of,them,a,bedslave,trained,at,yunkai,in,the,way,of,seven,sighs,it,was,a,great,scandal,and,a,greater,scandal,when,he,freed,her,and,took,her,for,his,wife,<END>
after,he,died,she,carried,on,his,ventures,<END>
no,freedman,may,dwell,within,the,black,wall,so,she,was,compelled,to,sell,vogarro's,manse,<END>

there,was,something,vulpine,about,the,way,the,woman,sat,in,her,corner,by,the,courtyard,something,reptilian,about,her,eyes,<END>
her,white,hair,was,so,thin,that,the,pink,of,her,scalp,showed,through,<END>
under,one,eye,she,still,bore,faint,scars,where,a,knife,had,cut,away,her,tears,<END>
the,remnants,of,her,morning,meal,littered,the,table,sardine,heads,olive,pits,chunks,of,flatbread,<END>

then,the,girl,was,on,him,once,again,<END>
tyrion,rolled,on,one,side,as,she,buried,the,knife,blade,in,the,floorboards,yanked,it,free,raised,it,again,and,suddenly,she,was,rising,off,the,floor,legs,kicking,wildly,as,she,struggled,in,ser,jorah's,grasp,<END>

they,cut,his,head,off,<END>
tyrion,felt,a,sudden,shock,of,recognition,<END>
they,saw,us,jousting,in,the,square,<END>
he,knew,who,the,girl,was,then,<END>

the,dog,she,sobbed,<END>

how,strange,to,encounter,them,again,half,a,world,away,<END>

someone,help,me,<END>
someone,kill,him,<END>
the,landlord,seized,her,roughly,by,one,arm,and,wrenched,her,back,to,her,feet,shouting,in,volantene,demanding,to,know,who,was,going,to,pay,for,this,damage,<END>
the,widow,of,the,waterfront,gave,mormont,a,cool,look,<END>

by,that,time,jace,had,found,his,feet,so,jon,put,him,down,again,<END>
i,hate,it,when,dead,men,get,up,<END>
you'll,feel,the,same,the,day,you,meet,a,wight,<END>
stepping,back,he,lowered,his,sword,<END>
the,big,crow,can,peck,the,little,crows,growled,a,voice,behind,him,but,has,he,belly,enough,to,fight,a,man,<END>
rattleshirt,was,leaning,against,a,wall,<END>
a,coarse,stubble,covered,his,sunken,cheeks,and,thin,brown,hair,was,blowing,across,his,little,yellow,eyes,<END>
you,flatter,yourself,jon,said,<END>
aye,but,i'd,flatten,you,<END>
stannis,burned,the,wrong,man,<END>
no,<END>
the,wildling,grinned,at,him,through,a,mouth,of,brown,and,broken,teeth,<END>
he,burned,the,man,he,had,to,burn,for,all,the,world,to,see,<END>
we,all,do,what,we,have,to,do,snow,<END>
even,kings,<END>
emmett,find,some,armor,for,him,<END>
i,want,him,in,steel,not,old,bones,<END>
once,clad,in,mail,and,plate,the,lord,of,bones,seemed,to,stand,a,little,straighter,<END>
he,seemed,taller,too,his,shoulders,thicker,and,more,powerful,than,jon,would,have,thought,<END>
it's,the,armor,not,the,man,he,told,himself,<END>
even,sam,could,appear,almost,formidable,clad,head,to,heel,in,donal,noye's,steel,<END>
the,wildling,waved,away,the,shield,horse,offered,him,<END>
instead,he,asked,for,a,two-handed,sword,<END>
there's,a,sweet,sound,he,said,slashing,at,the,air,<END>
flap,closer,snow,<END>
i,mean,to,make,your,feathers,fly,<END>
jon,rushed,him,hard,<END>
rattleshirt,took,a,step,backwards,and,met,the,charge,with,a,two-handed,slash,<END>
if,jon,had,not,interposed,his,shield,it,might,have,staved,his,breastplate,in,and,broken,half,his,ribs,<END>
the,force,of,the,blow,staggered,him,for,a,moment,and,sent,a,solid,jolt,up,his,arm,<END>
he,hits,harder,than,i,would,have,thought,<END>
his,quickness,was,another,unpleasant,surprise,<END>
they,circled,round,each,other,trading,blow,for,blow,<END>
the,lord,of,bones,gave,as,good,as,he,was,getting,<END>
by,rights,the,two-handed,greatsword,should,have,been,a,deal,more,cumbersome,than,jon's,longsword,but,the,wildling,wielded,it,with,blinding,speed,<END>
iron,emmett's,fledglings,cheered,their,lord,commander,at,the,start,but,the,relentless,speed,of,rattleshirt's,attack,soon,beat,them,down,to,silence,<END>
he,cannot,keep,this,up,for,long,jon,told,himself,as,he,stopped,another,blow,<END>
the,impact,made,him,grunt,<END>
even,dulled,the,greatsword,cracked,his,pinewood,shield,and,bent,the,iron,rim,<END>
he,will,tire,soon,<END>
he,must,<END>
jon,slashed,at,the,wildling's,face,and,rattleshirt,pulled,back,his,head,<END>
he,hacked,down,at,rattleshirt's,calf,only,to,have,him,deftly,leap,the,blade,<END>
the,greatsword,crashed,down,onto,jon's,shoulder,hard,enough,to,ding,his,pouldron,and,numb,the,arm,beneath,<END>
jon,backed,away,<END>
the,lord,of,bones,came,after,chortling,<END>
he,has,no,shield,jon,reminded,himself,and,that,monster,sword's,too,cumbersome,for,parries,<END>
i,should,be,landing,two,blows,for,every,one,of,his,<END>
somehow,he,wasn't,though,and,the,blows,he,did,land,were,having,no,effect,<END>
the,wildling,always,seemed,to,be,moving,away,or,sliding,sideways,so,jon's,longsword,glanced,off,a,shoulder,or,an,arm,<END>
before,long,he,found,himself,giving,more,ground,trying,to,avoid,the,other's,crashing,cuts,and,failing,half,the,time,<END>
his,shield,had,been,reduced,to,kindling,<END>
he,shook,it,off,his,arm,<END>
sweat,was,running,down,his,face,and,stinging,his,eyes,beneath,his,helm,<END>
he,is,too,strong,and,too,quick,he,realized,and,with,that,greatsword,he,has,weight,and,reach,on,me,<END>
it,would,have,been,a,different,fight,if,jon,had,been,armed,with,longclaw,but,his,chance,came,on,rattleshirt's,next,backswing,<END>
jon,threw,himself,forward,bulling,into,the,other,man,and,they,went,down,together,legs,entangled,<END>
steel,slammed,on,steel,<END>
both,men,lost,their,swords,as,they,rolled,on,the,hard,ground,<END>
the,wildling,drove,a,knee,between,jon's,legs,<END>
jon,lashed,out,with,a,mailed,fist,<END>
somehow,rattleshirt,ended,up,on,top,with,jon's,head,in,his,hands,<END>
he,smashed,it,against,the,ground,then,wrenched,his,visor,open,<END>
if,i,had,me,a,dagger,you'd,be,less,an,eye,by,now,he,snarled,before,horse,and,iron,emmett,dragged,him,off,the,lord,commander's,chest,<END>
let,go,o',me,you,bloody,crows,he,roared,<END>
jon,struggled,to,one,knee,<END>
his,head,was,ringing,and,his,mouth,was,full,of,blood,<END>

you,flatter,yourself,crow,<END>
i,never,broke,a,sweat,<END>

empty,sockets,weeping,blood,<END>
she,pushed,her,red,hair,back,and,her,red,eyes,shone,<END>
you,do,not,believe,me,<END>
you,will,<END>
the,cost,of,that,belief,will,be,three,lives,<END>
a,small,price,to,pay,for,wisdom,some,might,say,but,not,one,you,had,to,pay,<END>

dawn,had,come,but,not,the,porridge,garth,brought,him,every,morn,to,break,his,fast,<END>
that,made,him,anxious,<END>
all,the,days,were,much,the,same,inside,the,wolf's,den,and,any,change,was,usually,for,the,worse,<END>
this,may,be,the,day,i,die,<END>

the,tale,you,tell,is,one,we,all,have,heard,as,full,of,lies,as,a,pudding's,full,of,raisins,<END>
it,was,the,bastard,of,bolton,who,put,winterfell,to,the,sword,ramsay,snow,he,was,called,then,before,the,boy,king,made,him,a,bolton,<END>

the,boltons,have,always,been,as,cruel,as,they,were,cunning,but,this,one,seems,a,beast,in,human,skin,said,glover,<END>
the,lord,of,white,harbor,leaned,forward,<END>
the,freys,are,no,better,<END>
they,speak,of,wargs,and,skinchangers,and,assert,that,it,was,robb,stark,who,slew,my,wendel,<END>

wyman,manderly,lurched,ponderously,to,his,feet,<END>
i,have,been,building,warships,for,more,than,a,year,<END>
some,you,saw,but,there,are,as,many,more,hidden,up,the,white,knife,<END>
even,with,the,losses,i,have,suffered,i,still,command,more,heavy,horse,than,any,other,lord,north,of,the,neck,<END>

it's,not,a,king,i,need,but,a,smuggler,<END>
robett,glover,took,up,the,tale,<END>
we,may,never,know,all,that,happened,at,winterfell,when,ser,rodrik,cassel,tried,to,take,the,castle,back,from,theon,greyjoy's,ironmen,<END>
the,bastard,of,bolton,claims,that,greyjoy,murdered,ser,rodrik,during,a,parley,<END>
wex,says,no,<END>
until,he,learns,more,letters,we,will,never,know,half,the,truth,but,he,came,to,us,knowing,yes,and,no,and,those,can,go,a,long,way,once,you,find,the,right,questions,<END>
it,was,the,bastard,who,murdered,ser,rodrik,and,the,men,of,winterfell,said,lord,wyman,<END>
he,slew,greyjoy's,ironmen,as,well,<END>
wex,saw,men,cut,down,trying,to,yield,<END>
when,we,asked,how,he,escaped,he,took,a,chunk,of,chalk,and,drew,a,tree,with,a,face,<END>
davos,thought,about,that,<END>
the,old,gods,saved,him,<END>
after,a,fashion,<END>
he,climbed,the,heart,tree,and,hid,himself,amongst,the,leaves,<END>
bolton's,men,searched,the,godswood,twice,and,killed,the,men,they,found,there,but,none,thought,to,clamber,up,into,the,trees,<END>
is,that,how,it,happened,wex,<END>
the,boy,flipped,up,glover's,dagger,caught,it,nodded,<END>
glover,said,he,stayed,up,in,the,tree,a,long,time,<END>
he,slept,amongst,the,branches,not,daring,to,descend,<END>
finally,he,heard,voices,down,beneath,him,<END>
the,voices,of,the,dead,said,wyman,manderly,<END>
wex,held,up,five,fingers,tapped,each,one,with,the,dagger,then,folded,four,away,and,tapped,the,last,again,<END>
six,of,them,asked,davos,<END>
there,were,six,<END>
two,of,them,ned,stark's,murdered,sons,<END>
how,could,a,mute,tell,you,that,<END>
with,chalk,<END>
he,drew,two,boys,and,two,wolves,<END>
the,lad,is,ironborn,so,he,thought,it,best,not,to,show,himself,said,glover,<END>
he,listened,<END>
the,six,did,not,linger,long,amongst,the,ruins,of,winterfell,<END>
four,went,one,way,two,another,<END>
wex,stole,after,the,two,a,woman,and,a,boy,<END>
he,must,have,stayed,downwind,so,the,wolf,would,not,catch,his,scent,<END>
he,knows,where,they,went,lord,wyman,said,<END>
davos,understood,<END>
you,want,the,boy,<END>
roose,bolton,has,lord,eddard's,daughter,<END>
to,thwart,him,white,harbor,must,have,ned's,son,and,the,direwolf,<END>
the,wolf,will,prove,the,boy,is,who,we,say,he,is,should,the,dreadfort,attempt,to,deny,him,<END>
that,is,my,price,lord,davos,<END>
smuggle,me,back,my,liege,lord,and,i,will,take,stannis,baratheon,as,my,king,<END>
old,instinct,made,davos,seaworth,reach,for,his,throat,<END>
his,fingerbones,had,been,his,luck,and,somehow,he,felt,he,would,have,need,of,luck,to,do,what,wyman,manderly,was,asking,of,him,<END>
the,bones,were,gone,though,so,he,said,you,have,better,men,than,me,in,your,service,<END>
knights,and,lords,and,maesters,<END>
why,would,you,need,a,smuggler,<END>
you,have,ships,<END>
ships,lord,wyman,agreed,but,my,crews,are,rivermen,or,fisherfolk,who,have,never,sailed,beyond,the,bite,<END>
for,this,i,must,have,a,man,who's,sailed,in,darker,waters,and,knows,how,to,slip,past,dangers,unseen,and,unmolested,<END>
where,is,the,boy,<END>
somehow,davos,knew,he,would,not,like,the,answer,<END>
where,is,it,you,want,me,to,go,my,lord,<END>
robett,glover,said,wex,<END>
show,him,<END>
the,mute,flipped,the,dagger,caught,it,then,flung,it,end,over,end,at,the,sheepskin,map,that,adorned,lord,wyman's,wall,<END>
it,struck,quivering,<END>
then,he,grinned,<END>
for,half,a,heartbeat,davos,considered,asking,wyman,manderly,to,send,him,back,to,the,wolf's,den,to,ser,bartimus,with,his,tales,and,garth,with,his,lethal,ladies,<END>
in,the,den,even,prisoners,ate,porridge,in,the,morning,<END>

today,she,counted,five-and-twenty,though,some,were,far,away,and,moving,so,it,was,hard,to,be,certain,<END>
sometimes,she,missed,one,or,counted,one,twice,<END>
what,does,it,matter,<END>
a,strangler,only,needs,ten,fingers,<END>
all,trade,had,stopped,and,her,fisherfolk,did,not,dare,put,out,into,the,bay,<END>
the,boldest,still,dropped,a,few,lines,into,the,river,though,even,that,was,hazardous,more,remained,tied,up,beneath,meereen's,walls,of,many-colored,brick,<END>
there,were,ships,from,meereen,out,in,the,bay,too,warships,and,trading,galleys,whose,captains,had,taken,them,to,sea,when,dany's,host,first,laid,siege,to,the,city,now,returned,to,augment,the,fleets,from,qarth,tolos,and,new,ghis,<END>

the,cobbler,told,them,how,the,body,of,the,butcher,king,had,been,disinterred,and,clad,in,copper,armor,after,the,green,grace,of,astapor,had,a,vision,that,he,would,deliver,them,from,the,yunkai'i,<END>
armored,and,stinking,the,corpse,of,cleon,the,great,was,strapped,onto,the,back,of,a,starving,horse,to,lead,the,remnants,of,his,new,unsullied,on,a,sortie,but,they,rode,right,into,the,iron,teeth,of,a,legion,from,new,ghis,and,were,cut,down,to,a,man,<END>
afterward,the,green,grace,was,impaled,upon,a,stake,in,the,plaza,of,punishment,and,left,until,she,died,<END>
in,the,pyramid,of,ullhor,the,survivors,had,a,great,feast,that,lasted,half,the,night,and,washed,the,last,of,their,food,down,with,poison,wine,so,none,need,wake,again,come,morning,<END>

the,guards,were,torn,apart,and,the,gates,thrown,open,<END>
the,legions,of,new,ghis,came,pouring,into,astapor,followed,by,the,yunkai'i,and,the,sellswords,on,their,horses,<END>

and,when,the,city,fell,<END>

the,butchery,began,<END>
the,temple,of,the,graces,was,full,of,the,sick,who,had,come,to,ask,the,gods,to,heal,them,<END>
the,legions,sealed,the,doors,and,set,the,temple,ablaze,with,torches,<END>
within,the,hour,fires,were,burning,in,every,corner,of,the,city,<END>

she,could,still,recall,the,red,city,as,she,had,first,seen,it,dry,and,dusty,behind,its,red,brick,walls,dreaming,cruel,dreams,yet,full,of,life,<END>
there,were,islands,in,the,worm,where,lovers,kissed,but,in,the,plaza,of,punishment,they,peeled,the,skin,off,men,in,strips,and,left,them,hanging,naked,for,the,flies,<END>
it,is,good,that,you,have,come,she,told,the,astapori,<END>

whenever,she,was,asked,what,she,saw,within,her,fires,melisandre,would,answer,much,and,more,but,seeing,was,never,as,simple,as,those,words,suggested,<END>
it,was,an,art,and,like,all,arts,it,demanded,mastery,discipline,study,<END>
pain,<END>
that,too,<END>

the,boy,was,half,in,love,with,her,she,knew,<END>
he,fears,me,he,wants,me,and,he,worships,me,<END>
all,the,same,devan,was,not,pleased,to,be,here,<END>
the,lad,had,taken,great,pride,in,serving,as,a,king's,squire,and,it,had,wounded,him,when,stannis,commanded,him,to,remain,at,castle,black,<END>
like,any,boy,his,age,his,head,was,full,of,dreams,of,glory,no,doubt,he,had,been,picturing,the,prowess,he,would,display,at,deepwood,motte,<END>
other,boys,his,age,had,gone,south,to,serve,as,squires,to,the,king's,knights,and,ride,into,battle,at,their,side,<END>
devan's,exclusion,must,have,seemed,a,rebuke,a,punishment,for,some,failure,on,his,part,or,perhaps,for,some,failure,of,his,father,<END>
in,truth,he,was,here,because,melisandre,had,asked,for,him,<END>

lord,davos,would,not,thank,her,for,it,no,more,than,the,boy,himself,but,it,seemed,to,her,that,seaworth,had,suffered,enough,grief,<END>
misguided,as,he,was,his,loyalty,to,stannis,could,not,be,doubted,<END>
she,had,seen,that,in,her,flames,<END>
devan,was,quick,and,smart,and,able,too,which,was,more,than,could,be,said,about,most,of,her,attendants,<END>
stannis,had,left,a,dozen,of,his,men,behind,to,serve,her,when,he,marched,south,but,most,of,them,were,useless,<END>
his,grace,had,need,of,every,sword,so,all,he,could,spare,were,greybeards,and,cripples,<END>

having,guards,about,her,would,no,doubt,help,keep,the,black,brothers,properly,respectful,the,red,priestess,knew,but,none,of,the,men,that,stannis,had,given,her,were,like,to,be,much,help,should,she,find,herself,in,peril,<END>
it,made,no,matter,<END>
melisandre,of,asshai,did,not,fear,for,herself,<END>

after,gazing,into,the,flames,so,long,it,took,her,a,few,moments,to,adjust,to,the,dimness,<END>
her,eyes,were,dry,and,tired,but,if,she,rubbed,them,it,would,only,make,them,worse,<END>

she,would,sooner,sit,bathed,in,the,ruddy,glow,of,her,red,lord's,blessed,flames,her,cheeks,flushed,by,the,wash,of,heat,as,if,by,a,lover's,kisses,<END>

the,dark,recedes,again,for,a,little,while,<END>
but,beyond,the,wall,the,enemy,grows,stronger,and,should,he,win,the,dawn,will,never,come,again,<END>

it,was,jon,snow,she,needed,not,fried,bread,and,bacon,but,it,was,no,use,sending,devan,to,the,lord,commander,<END>
he,would,not,come,to,her,summons,<END>
snow,still,chose,to,dwell,behind,the,armory,in,a,pair,of,modest,rooms,previously,occupied,by,the,watch's,late,blacksmith,<END>
perhaps,he,did,not,think,himself,worthy,of,the,king's,tower,or,perhaps,he,did,not,care,<END>
that,was,his,mistake,the,false,humility,of,youth,that,is,itself,a,sort,of,pride,<END>
it,was,never,wise,for,a,ruler,to,eschew,the,trappings,of,power,for,power,itself,flows,in,no,small,measure,from,such,trappings,<END>
the,boy,was,not,entirely,naive,however,<END>
he,knew,better,than,to,come,to,melisandre's,chambers,like,a,supplicant,insisting,she,come,to,him,instead,should,she,have,need,of,words,with,him,<END>
and,oft,as,not,when,she,did,come,he,would,keep,her,waiting,or,refuse,to,see,her,<END>

the,trappings,of,power,<END>
by,the,time,the,three,of,them,emerged,north,of,the,wall,the,snow,was,falling,steadily,<END>

at,the,top,of,each,was,impaled,a,severed,head,<END>
their,beards,were,full,of,ice,and,the,falling,snow,had,given,them,white,hoods,<END>
where,their,eyes,had,been,only,empty,sockets,remained,black,and,bloody,holes,that,stared,down,in,silent,accusation,<END>

black,jack,bulwer,hairy,hal,and,garth,greyfeather,bowen,marsh,said,solemnly,<END>
the,ground,is,half-frozen,<END>
it,must,have,taken,the,wildlings,half,the,night,to,drive,the,spears,so,deep,<END>
they,could,still,be,close,<END>

somehow,melisandre,did,not,think,so,<END>
if,it,comes,that,attack,will,be,no,more,than,a,diversion,<END>

her,captain,a,mean-mouthed,flinty,kettle-bellied,man,with,close-set,greedy,eyes,was,a,bad,cyvasse,player,and,a,worse,loser,<END>
under,him,served,four,mates,freedmen,all,and,fifty,slaves,bound,to,the,ship,each,with,a,crude,version,of,the,cog's,figurehead,tattooed,upon,one,cheek,<END>
no-nose,the,sailors,liked,to,call,tyrion,no,matter,how,many,times,he,told,them,his,name,was,hugor,hill,<END>
three,of,the,mates,and,more,than,three-quarters,of,the,crew,were,fervent,worshipers,of,the,lord,of,light,<END>
tyrion,was,less,certain,about,the,captain,who,always,emerged,for,the,evening,prayers,but,took,no,other,part,in,them,<END>
but,moqorro,was,the,true,master,of,the,selaesori,qhoran,at,least,for,this,voyage,<END>
lord,of,light,bless,your,slave,moqorro,and,light,his,way,in,the,dark,places,of,the,world,the,red,priest,boomed,<END>
and,defend,your,righteous,slave,benerro,<END>
grant,him,courage,<END>
grant,him,wisdom,<END>
fill,his,heart,with,fire,<END>
that,was,when,tyrion,noticed,penny,watching,the,mummery,from,the,steep,wooden,stair,that,led,down,beneath,the,sterncastle,<END>
she,stood,on,one,of,the,lower,steps,so,only,the,top,of,her,head,was,visible,<END>
beneath,her,hood,her,eyes,shone,big,and,white,in,the,light,of,the,nightfire,<END>
she,had,her,dog,with,her,the,big,grey,hound,she,rode,in,the,mock,jousts,<END>
my,lady,tyrion,called,softly,<END>
in,truth,she,was,no,lady,but,he,could,not,bring,himself,to,mouth,that,silly,name,of,hers,and,he,was,not,about,to,call,her,girl,or,dwarf,<END>
she,cringed,back,<END>
i,i,did,not,see,you,<END>
well,i,am,small,<END>
i,i,was,unwell,her,dog,barked,<END>
sick,with,grief,you,mean,<END>
if,i,can,be,of,help,no,<END>
and,quick,as,that,she,was,gone,again,retreating,back,below,to,the,cabin,she,shared,with,her,dog,and,sow,<END>
tyrion,could,not,fault,her,<END>
the,crew,of,the,selaesori,qhoran,had,been,pleased,enough,when,he,first,came,on,board,a,dwarf,was,good,luck,after,all,<END>
his,head,had,been,rubbed,so,often,and,so,vigorously,that,it,was,a,wonder,he,wasn't,bald,<END>
but,penny,had,met,with,a,more,mixed,reaction,<END>
she,might,be,a,dwarf,but,she,was,also,a,woman,and,women,were,bad,luck,aboard,ship,<END>
for,every,man,who,tried,to,rub,her,head,there,were,three,who,muttered,maledictions,under,their,breath,when,she,went,by,<END>
and,the,sight,of,me,can,only,be,salt,in,her,wound,<END>
they,hacked,off,her,brother's,head,in,the,hope,that,it,was,mine,yet,here,i,sit,like,some,bloody,gargoyle,offering,empty,consolations,<END>
if,i,were,her,i'd,want,nothing,more,than,to,shove,me,into,the,sea,<END>
he,felt,nothing,but,pity,for,the,girl,<END>
she,did,not,deserve,the,horror,visited,on,her,in,volantis,any,more,than,her,brother,had,<END>
the,last,time,he,had,seen,her,just,before,they,left,port,her,eyes,had,been,raw,from,crying,two,ghastly,red,holes,in,a,wan,pale,face,<END>
by,the,time,they,raised,sail,she,had,locked,herself,in,her,cabin,with,her,dog,and,her,pig,but,at,night,they,could,hear,her,weeping,<END>
only,yesterday,he,had,heard,one,of,the,mates,say,that,they,ought,to,throw,her,overboard,before,her,tears,could,swamp,the,ship,<END>
tyrion,was,not,entirely,sure,he,had,been,japing,<END>
when,the,evening,prayers,had,ended,and,the,ship's,crew,had,once,again,dispersed,some,to,their,watch,and,others,to,food,and,rum,and,hammocks,moqorro,remained,beside,his,nightfire,as,he,did,every,night,<END>
the,red,priest,rested,by,day,but,kept,vigil,through,the,dark,hours,to,tend,his,sacred,flames,so,that,the,sun,might,return,to,them,at,dawn,<END>
tyrion,squatted,across,from,him,and,warmed,his,hands,against,the,night's,chill,<END>
moqorro,took,no,notice,of,him,for,several,moments,<END>
he,was,staring,into,the,flickering,flames,lost,in,some,vision,<END>
does,he,see,days,yet,to,come,as,he,claims,<END>
if,so,that,was,a,fearsome,gift,<END>
after,a,time,the,priest,raised,his,eyes,to,meet,the,dwarf's,<END>
hugor,hill,he,said,inclining,his,head,in,a,solemn,nod,<END>
have,you,come,to,pray,with,me,<END>
someone,told,me,that,the,night,is,dark,and,full,of,terrors,<END>
what,do,you,see,in,those,flames,<END>
dragons,moqorro,said,in,the,common,tongue,of,westeros,<END>
he,spoke,it,very,well,with,hardly,a,trace,of,accent,<END>
no,doubt,that,was,one,reason,the,high,priest,benerro,had,chosen,him,to,bring,the,faith,of,r'hllor,to,daenerys,targaryen,<END>
dragons,old,and,young,true,and,false,bright,and,dark,<END>
and,you,<END>
a,small,man,with,a,big,shadow,snarling,in,the,midst,of,all,<END>
snarling,<END>
an,amiable,fellow,like,me,<END>
tyrion,was,almost,flattered,<END>
and,no,doubt,that,is,just,what,he,intends,<END>
every,fool,loves,to,hear,that,he's,important,<END>
perhaps,it,was,penny,you,saw,<END>
we're,almost,of,a,size,<END>
no,my,friend,<END>
my,friend,<END>
when,did,that,happen,i,wonder,<END>
did,you,see,how,long,it,will,take,us,to,reach,meereen,<END>
you,are,eager,to,behold,the,world's,deliverer,<END>
yes,and,no,<END>
the,world's,deliverer,may,snick,off,my,head,or,give,me,to,her,dragons,as,a,savory,<END>
not,me,said,tyrion,<END>
for,me,it,is,all,about,the,olives,<END>
though,i,fear,i,may,grow,old,and,die,before,i,taste,one,<END>
i,could,dog-paddle,faster,than,we're,sailing,<END>
tell,me,was,selaesori,qhoran,a,triarch,or,a,turtle,<END>
the,red,priest,chuckled,<END>
neither,<END>
qhoran,is,not,a,ruler,but,one,who,serves,and,counsels,such,and,helps,conduct,his,business,<END>
you,of,westeros,might,say,steward,or,magister,<END>
king's,hand,<END>
that,amused,him,<END>
and,selaesori,<END>
moqorro,touched,his,nose,<END>
imbued,with,a,pleasant,aroma,<END>
fragrant,would,you,say,<END>
flowery,<END>
so,selaesori,qhoran,means,stinky,steward,more,or,less,<END>
fragrant,steward,rather,<END>
tyrion,gave,a,crooked,grin,<END>
i,believe,i,will,stay,with,stinky,<END>
but,i,do,thank,you,for,the,lesson,<END>
i,am,pleased,to,have,enlightened,you,<END>
perhaps,someday,you,will,let,me,teach,you,the,truth,of,r'hllor,as,well,<END>
someday,<END>
when,i,am,a,head,on,a,spike,<END>
the,quarters,he,shared,with,ser,jorah,were,a,cabin,only,by,courtesy,the,dank,dark,foul-smelling,closet,had,barely,enough,space,to,hang,a,pair,of,sleeping,hammocks,one,above,the,other,<END>
he,found,mormont,stretched,out,in,the,lower,one,swaying,slowly,with,the,motion,of,the,ship,<END>
the,girl,finally,poked,her,nose,abovedecks,tyrion,told,him,<END>
one,look,at,me,and,she,scurried,right,back,down,below,<END>
you're,not,a,pretty,sight,<END>
not,all,of,us,can,be,as,comely,as,you,<END>
the,girl,is,lost,<END>
it,would,not,surprise,me,if,the,poor,creature,wasn't,sneaking,up,to,jump,over,the,side,and,drown,herself,<END>
the,poor,creature's,name,is,penny,<END>
i,know,her,name,<END>
he,hated,her,name,<END>
her,brother,had,gone,by,the,name,of,groat,though,his,true,name,had,been,oppo,<END>
groat,and,penny,<END>
the,smallest,coins,worth,the,least,and,what's,worse,they,chose,the,names,themselves,<END>
it,left,a,bad,taste,in,tyrion's,mouth,<END>
by,any,name,she,needs,a,friend,<END>
ser,jorah,sat,up,in,his,hammock,<END>
befriend,her,then,<END>
marry,her,for,all,i,care,<END>
that,left,a,bad,taste,in,his,mouth,as,well,<END>
like,with,like,is,that,your,notion,<END>
do,you,mean,to,find,a,she-bear,for,yourself,ser,<END>
you,were,the,one,who,insisted,that,we,bring,her,<END>
i,said,we,could,not,abandon,her,in,volantis,<END>
that,does,not,mean,i,want,to,fuck,her,<END>
she,wants,me,dead,have,you,forgotten,<END>
i'm,the,last,person,she's,like,to,want,as,a,friend,<END>
you're,both,dwarfs,<END>
yes,and,so,was,her,brother,who,was,killed,because,some,drunken,fools,took,him,for,me,<END>
feeling,guilty,are,you,<END>
no,<END>
tyrion,bristled,<END>
i,have,sins,enough,to,answer,for,i'll,have,no,part,of,this,one,<END>
i,might,have,nurtured,some,ill,will,toward,her,and,her,brother,for,the,part,they,played,the,night,of,joffrey's,wedding,but,i,never,wished,them,harm,<END>
you,are,a,harmless,creature,to,be,sure,<END>
innocent,as,a,lamb,<END>
ser,jorah,got,to,his,feet,<END>
the,dwarf,girl,is,your,burden,<END>
kiss,her,kill,her,or,avoid,her,as,you,like,<END>
it's,naught,to,me,<END>
he,shouldered,past,tyrion,and,out,of,the,cabin,<END>
twice,exiled,and,small,wonder,tyrion,thought,<END>
i'd,exile,him,too,if,i,could,<END>
the,man,is,cold,brooding,sullen,deaf,to,humor,<END>
and,those,are,his,good,points,<END>
ser,jorah,spent,most,of,his,waking,hours,pacing,the,forecastle,or,leaning,on,the,rail,gazing,out,to,sea,<END>
looking,for,his,silver,queen,<END>
looking,for,daenerys,willing,the,ship,to,sail,faster,<END>
well,i,might,do,the,same,if,tysha,waited,in,meereen,<END>
could,slaver's,bay,be,where,whores,went,<END>
it,seemed,unlikely,<END>
from,what,he'd,read,the,slaver,cities,were,the,place,where,whores,were,made,<END>
mormont,should,have,bought,one,for,himself,<END>
a,pretty,slave,girl,might,have,done,wonders,to,improve,his,temper,particularly,one,with,silvery,hair,like,the,whore,who,had,been,sitting,on,his,cock,back,in,selhorys,<END>
on,the,river,tyrion,had,to,endure,griff,but,there,had,at,least,been,the,mystery,of,the,captain's,true,identity,to,divert,him,and,the,more,congenial,companionship,of,the,rest,of,the,poleboat's,little,company,<END>
on,the,cog,alas,everyone,was,just,who,they,appeared,to,be,no,one,was,particularly,congenial,and,only,the,red,priest,was,interesting,<END>
him,and,maybe,penny,<END>
but,the,girl,hates,me,and,she,should,<END>
life,aboard,the,selaesori,qhoran,was,nothing,if,not,tedious,tyrion,had,found,<END>
the,most,exciting,part,of,his,day,was,pricking,his,toes,and,fingers,with,a,knife,<END>
on,the,river,there,had,been,wonders,to,behold,giant,turtles,ruined,cities,stone,men,naked,septas,<END>
one,never,knew,what,might,be,lurking,around,the,next,bend,<END>
the,days,and,nights,at,sea,were,all,the,same,<END>
leaving,volantis,the,cog,had,sailed,within,sight,of,land,at,first,so,tyrion,could,gaze,at,passing,headlands,watch,clouds,of,seabirds,rise,from,stony,cliffs,and,crumbling,watchtowers,count,bare,brown,islands,as,they,slipped,past,<END>
he,saw,many,other,ships,as,well,fishing,boats,lumbering,merchantmen,proud,galleys,with,their,oars,lashing,the,waves,into,white,foam,<END>
but,once,they,struck,out,into,deeper,waters,there,was,only,sea,and,sky,air,and,water,<END>
the,water,looked,like,water,<END>
the,sky,looked,like,sky,<END>
sometimes,there,was,a,cloud,<END>
too,much,blue,<END>
and,the,nights,were,worse,<END>
tyrion,slept,badly,at,the,best,of,times,and,this,was,far,from,that,<END>
sleep,meant,dreams,as,like,as,not,and,in,his,dreams,the,sorrows,waited,and,a,stony,king,with,his,father's,face,<END>
that,left,him,with,the,beggar's,choice,of,climbing,up,into,his,hammock,and,listening,to,jorah,mormont,snore,beneath,him,or,remaining,abovedecks,to,contemplate,the,sea,<END>
on,moonless,nights,the,water,was,as,black,as,maester's,ink,from,horizon,to,horizon,<END>
dark,and,deep,and,forbidding,beautiful,in,a,chilly,sort,of,way,but,when,he,looked,at,it,too,long,tyrion,found,himself,musing,on,how,easy,it,would,be,to,slip,over,the,gunwale,and,drop,down,into,that,darkness,<END>
one,very,small,splash,and,the,pathetic,little,tale,that,was,his,life,would,soon,be,done,<END>
but,what,if,there,is,a,hell,and,my,father's,waiting,for,me,<END>
the,best,part,of,each,evening,was,supper,<END>
the,food,was,not,especially,good,but,it,was,plentiful,so,that,was,where,the,dwarf,went,next,<END>
the,galley,where,he,took,his,meals,was,a,cramped,and,uncomfortable,space,with,a,ceiling,so,low,that,the,taller,passengers,were,always,in,danger,of,cracking,their,heads,a,hazard,the,strapping,slave,soldiers,of,the,fiery,hand,seemed,particularly,prone,to,<END>
as,much,as,tyrion,enjoyed,sniggering,at,that,he,had,come,to,prefer,taking,his,meals,alone,<END>
sitting,at,a,crowded,table,with,men,who,did,not,share,a,common,language,with,you,listening,to,them,talk,and,jape,whilst,understanding,none,of,it,had,quickly,grown,wearisome,<END>
particularly,since,he,always,found,himself,wondering,if,the,japes,and,laughter,were,directed,at,him,<END>
the,galley,was,also,where,the,ship's,books,were,kept,<END>
her,captain,being,an,especially,bookish,man,she,carried,three,a,collection,of,nautical,poetry,that,went,from,bad,to,worse,a,well-thumbed,tome,about,the,erotic,adventures,of,a,young,slave,girl,in,a,lysene,pillow,house,and,the,fourth,and,final,volume,of,the,life,of,the,triarch,belicho,a,famous,volantene,patriot,whose,unbroken,succession,of,conquests,and,triumphs,ended,rather,abruptly,when,he,was,eaten,by,giants,<END>
tyrion,had,finished,them,all,by,their,third,day,at,sea,<END>
then,for,lack,of,any,other,books,he,started,reading,them,again,<END>
the,slave,girl's,story,was,the,worst,written,but,the,most,engrossing,and,that,was,the,one,he,took,down,this,evening,to,see,him,through,a,supper,of,buttered,beets,cold,fish,stew,and,biscuits,that,could,have,been,used,to,drive,nails,<END>
he,was,reading,the,girl's,account,of,the,day,she,and,her,sister,were,taken,by,slavers,when,penny,entered,the,galley,<END>
oh,she,said,i,thought,i,did,not,mean,to,disturb,m'lord,i,you,are,not,disturbing,me,<END>
you're,not,going,to,try,to,kill,me,again,i,hope,<END>
no,<END>
she,looked,away,her,face,reddening,<END>
in,that,case,i,would,welcome,some,company,<END>
there's,little,enough,aboard,this,ship,<END>
tyrion,closed,the,book,<END>
come,<END>
sit,<END>
eat,<END>
the,girl,had,left,most,of,her,meals,untouched,outside,her,cabin,door,<END>
by,now,she,must,be,starving,<END>
the,stew,is,almost,edible,<END>
the,fish,is,fresh,at,least,<END>
no,i,i,choked,on,a,fish,bone,once,i,can't,eat,fish,<END>
have,some,wine,then,<END>
he,filled,a,cup,and,slid,it,toward,her,<END>
compliments,of,our,captain,<END>
closer,to,piss,than,arbor,gold,if,truth,be,told,but,even,piss,tastes,better,than,the,black,tar,rum,the,sailors,drink,<END>
it,might,help,you,sleep,<END>
the,girl,made,no,move,to,touch,the,cup,<END>
thank,you,m'lord,but,no,<END>
she,backed,away,<END>
i,should,not,be,bothering,you,<END>
do,you,mean,to,spend,your,whole,life,running,away,<END>
tyrion,asked,before,she,could,slip,back,out,the,door,<END>
that,stopped,her,<END>
her,cheeks,turned,a,bright,pink,and,he,was,afraid,she,was,about,to,start,weeping,again,<END>
instead,she,thrust,out,her,lip,defiantly,and,said,you're,running,too,<END>
i,am,he,confessed,but,i,am,running,to,and,you,are,running,from,and,there's,a,world,of,difference,there,<END>
we,would,never,have,had,to,run,at,all,but,for,you,<END>
it,took,some,courage,to,say,that,to,my,face,<END>
are,you,speaking,of,king's,landing,or,volantis,<END>
both,<END>
tears,glistened,in,her,eyes,<END>
everything,<END>
why,couldn't,you,just,come,joust,with,us,the,way,the,king,wanted,<END>
you,wouldn't,have,gotten,hurt,<END>
what,would,that,have,cost,m'lord,to,climb,up,on,our,dog,and,ride,a,tilt,to,please,the,boy,<END>
it,was,just,a,bit,of,fun,<END>
they,would,have,laughed,at,you,that's,all,<END>
they,would,have,laughed,at,me,said,tyrion,<END>
i,made,them,laugh,at,joff,instead,<END>
and,wasn't,that,a,clever,ploy,<END>
my,brother,says,that,is,a,good,thing,making,people,laugh,<END>
a,noble,thing,and,honorable,<END>
my,brother,says,he,the,tears,fell,then,rolling,down,her,face,<END>
i,am,sorry,about,your,brother,<END>
tyrion,had,said,the,same,words,to,her,before,back,in,volantis,but,she,was,so,far,gone,in,grief,back,there,that,he,doubted,she,had,heard,them,<END>
she,heard,them,now,<END>
sorry,<END>
you,are,sorry,<END>
her,lip,was,trembling,her,cheeks,were,wet,her,eyes,were,red-rimmed,holes,<END>
we,left,king's,landing,that,very,night,<END>
my,brother,said,it,was,for,the,best,before,someone,wondered,if,we'd,had,some,part,in,the,king's,death,and,decided,to,torture,us,to,find,out,<END>
we,went,to,tyrosh,first,<END>
my,brother,thought,that,would,be,far,enough,but,it,wasn't,<END>
we,knew,a,juggler,there,<END>
for,years,and,years,he,would,juggle,every,day,by,the,fountain,of,the,drunken,god,<END>
he,was,old,so,his,hands,were,not,as,deft,as,they,had,been,and,sometimes,he,would,drop,his,balls,and,chase,them,across,the,square,but,the,tyroshi,would,laugh,and,throw,him,coins,all,the,same,<END>
then,one,morning,we,heard,that,his,body,had,been,found,at,the,temple,of,trios,<END>
trios,has,three,heads,and,there's,a,big,statue,of,him,beside,the,temple,doors,<END>
the,old,man,had,been,cut,into,three,parts,and,pushed,inside,the,threefold,mouths,of,trios,<END>
only,when,the,parts,were,sewn,back,together,his,head,was,gone,<END>
a,gift,for,my,sweet,sister,<END>
he,was,another,dwarf,<END>
a,little,man,aye,<END>
like,you,and,oppo,<END>
groat,<END>
are,you,sorry,about,the,juggler,too,<END>
i,never,knew,your,juggler,existed,until,this,very,moment,but,yes,i,am,sorry,he,is,dead,<END>
he,died,for,you,<END>
his,blood,is,on,your,hands,<END>
the,accusation,stung,coming,so,hard,on,the,heels,of,jorah,mormont's,words,<END>
his,blood,is,on,my,sister's,hands,and,the,hands,of,the,brutes,who,killed,him,<END>
my,hands,tyrion,turned,them,over,inspected,them,coiled,them,into,fists,<END>
my,hands,are,crusted,with,old,blood,aye,<END>
call,me,kinslayer,and,you,won't,be,wrong,<END>
kingslayer,i'll,answer,to,that,one,as,well,<END>
i,have,killed,mothers,fathers,nephews,lovers,men,and,women,kings,and,whores,<END>
a,singer,once,annoyed,me,so,i,had,the,bastard,stewed,<END>
but,i,have,never,killed,a,juggler,nor,a,dwarf,and,i,am,not,to,blame,for,what,happened,to,your,bloody,brother,<END>
penny,picked,the,cup,of,wine,he'd,poured,for,her,and,threw,it,in,his,face,<END>
just,like,my,sweet,sister,<END>
he,heard,the,galley,door,slam,but,never,saw,her,leave,<END>
his,eyes,were,stinging,and,the,world,was,a,blur,<END>
so,much,for,befriending,her,<END>
tyrion,lannister,had,scant,experience,with,other,dwarfs,<END>
his,lord,father,had,not,welcomed,any,reminders,of,his,son's,deformities,and,such,mummers,as,featured,little,folk,in,their,troupes,soon,learned,to,stay,away,from,lannisport,and,casterly,rock,at,the,risk,of,his,displeasure,<END>

less,reliable,tales,also,reached,his,ears,of,a,dwarf,witch,who,haunted,a,hill,in,the,riverlands,and,a,dwarf,whore,in,king's,landing,renowned,for,coupling,with,dogs,<END>
his,own,sweet,sister,had,told,him,of,the,last,even,offering,to,find,him,a,bitch,in,heat,if,he,cared,to,try,it,out,<END>
when,he,asked,politely,if,she,were,referring,to,herself,cersei,had,thrown,a,cup,of,wine,in,his,face,<END>
that,was,red,as,i,recall,and,this,is,gold,<END>
tyrion,mopped,at,his,face,with,a,sleeve,<END>
his,eyes,still,stung,<END>
he,did,not,see,penny,again,until,the,day,of,the,storm,<END>
the,salt,air,lay,still,and,heavy,that,morning,but,the,western,sky,was,a,fiery,red,streaked,with,lowering,clouds,that,glowed,as,bright,as,lannister,crimson,<END>
sailors,were,dashing,about,battening,hatches,running,lines,clearing,the,decks,lashing,down,everything,that,was,not,already,lashed,down,<END>
bad,wind,coming,one,warned,him,<END>
nonose,should,get,below,<END>
tyrion,remembered,the,storm,he'd,suffered,crossing,the,narrow,sea,the,way,the,deck,had,jumped,beneath,his,feet,the,hideous,creaking,sounds,the,ship,had,made,the,taste,of,wine,and,vomit,<END>
no-nose,will,stay,up,here,<END>
if,the,gods,wanted,him,he,would,sooner,die,by,drowning,than,choking,on,his,own,vomit,<END>
and,overhead,the,cog's,canvas,sail,rippled,slowly,like,the,fur,of,some,great,beast,stirring,from,a,long,sleep,then,filled,with,a,sudden,crack,that,turned,every,head,on,the,ship,<END>
the,winds,drove,the,cog,before,them,far,off,her,chosen,course,<END>
behind,them,black,clouds,piled,one,atop,another,against,a,blood-red,sky,<END>
by,midmorning,they,could,see,lightning,flickering,to,the,west,followed,by,the,distant,crash,of,thunder,<END>
the,sea,grew,rougher,and,dark,waves,rose,up,to,smash,against,the,hull,of,the,stinky,steward,<END>
it,was,about,then,that,the,crew,started,hauling,down,the,canvas,<END>
tyrion,was,underfoot,amidships,so,he,climbed,the,forecastle,and,hunkered,down,savoring,the,lash,of,cold,rain,on,his,cheeks,<END>
the,cog,went,up,and,down,bucking,more,wildly,than,any,horse,he'd,ever,ridden,lifting,with,each,wave,before,sliding,down,into,the,troughs,between,jarring,him,to,the,bones,<END>
even,so,it,was,better,here,where,he,could,see,than,down,below,locked,in,some,airless,cabin,<END>
by,the,time,the,storm,broke,evening,was,upon,them,and,tyrion,lannister,was,soaked,through,to,the,smallclothes,yet,somehow,he,felt,elated,and,even,more,so,later,when,he,found,a,drunken,jorah,mormont,in,a,pool,of,vomit,in,their,cabin,<END>
the,dwarf,lingered,in,the,galley,after,supper,celebrating,his,survival,by,sharing,a,few,tots,of,black,tar,rum,with,the,ship's,cook,a,great,greasy,loutish,volantene,who,spoke,only,one,word,of,the,common,tongue,fuck,but,played,a,ferocious,game,of,cyvasse,particularly,when,drunk,<END>
they,played,three,games,that,night,<END>
tyrion,won,the,first,then,lost,the,other,two,<END>
after,that,he,decided,that,he'd,had,enough,and,stumbled,back,up,on,deck,to,clear,his,head,of,rum,and,elephants,alike,<END>
he,found,penny,on,the,forecastle,where,he,had,so,often,found,ser,jorah,standing,by,the,rail,beside,the,cog's,hideous,half-rotted,figurehead,and,gazing,out,across,the,inky,sea,<END>
from,behind,she,looked,as,small,and,vulnerable,as,a,child,<END>
tyrion,thought,it,best,to,leave,her,undisturbed,but,it,was,too,late,<END>
she,had,heard,him,<END>

we,both,know,better,<END>
i,am,sorry,to,intrude,on,you,<END>

about,the,wine,<END>
it,wasn't,you,who,killed,my,brother,or,that,poor,old,man,in,tyrosh,<END>

count,yourself,lucky,<END>
your,brother,died,before,he,could,betray,you,<END>
i,thought,i,wanted,to,die,she,said,but,today,when,the,storm,came,and,i,thought,the,ship,would,sink,i,i,you,realized,that,you,wanted,to,live,after,all,<END>
i,have,been,there,too,<END>
something,else,we,have,in,common,<END>
her,teeth,were,crooked,which,made,her,shy,with,her,smiles,but,she,smiled,now,<END>
did,you,truly,cook,a,singer,in,a,stew,<END>
who,me,<END>
no,<END>
i,do,not,cook,<END>
when,penny,giggled,she,sounded,like,the,sweet,young,girl,she,was,seventeen,eighteen,no,more,than,nineteen,<END>
what,did,he,do,this,singer,<END>
he,wrote,a,song,about,me,<END>
for,she,was,his,secret,treasure,she,was,his,shame,and,his,bliss,<END>
and,a,chain,and,a,keep,are,nothing,compared,to,a,woman's,kiss,<END>
it,was,queer,how,quick,the,words,came,back,to,him,<END>
perhaps,they,had,never,left,him,<END>
hands,of,gold,are,always,cold,but,a,woman's,hands,are,warm,<END>
it,must,have,been,a,very,bad,song,<END>
not,really,<END>
it,was,no,rains,of,castamere,',mind,you,but,some,parts,were,well,how,did,it,go,<END>
he,laughed,<END>
no,<END>
you,do,not,want,to,hear,me,sing,<END>
my,mother,used,to,sing,to,us,when,we,were,children,<END>
my,brother,and,me,<END>
she,always,said,that,it,didn't,matter,what,your,voice,was,like,so,long,as,you,loved,the,song,<END>
was,she,<END>
a,little,person,<END>
no,but,our,father,was,<END>
his,own,father,sold,him,to,a,slaver,when,he,was,three,but,he,grew,up,to,be,such,a,famous,mummer,that,he,bought,his,freedom,<END>
he,traveled,to,all,the,free,cities,and,westeros,as,well,<END>
in,oldtown,they,used,to,call,him,hop-bean,<END>
of,course,they,did,<END>
tyrion,tried,not,to,wince,<END>
he's,dead,now,penny,went,on,<END>
my,mother,too,<END>
oppo,he,was,my,last,family,and,now,he's,gone,too,<END>
she,turned,her,head,away,and,gazed,out,across,the,sea,<END>
what,will,i,do,<END>
where,will,i,go,<END>
i,have,no,trade,just,the,jousting,show,and,that,needs,two,<END>
no,thought,tyrion,<END>
that,is,not,a,place,you,want,to,go,girl,<END>
do,not,ask,that,of,me,<END>
do,not,even,think,it,<END>
find,yourself,some,likely,orphan,boy,he,suggested,<END>
penny,did,not,seem,to,hear,that,<END>
it,was,father's,idea,to,do,the,tilts,<END>
he,even,trained,the,first,pig,but,by,then,he,was,too,sick,to,ride,her,so,oppo,took,his,place,<END>
i,always,rode,the,dog,<END>
we,performed,for,the,sealord,of,braavos,once,and,he,laughed,so,hard,that,afterward,he,gave,each,of,us,a,a,grand,gift,<END>
is,that,where,my,sister,found,you,<END>
in,braavos,<END>
your,sister,<END>
the,girl,looked,lost,<END>
queen,cersei,<END>
penny,shook,her,head,<END>
she,never,it,was,a,man,who,came,to,us,in,pentos,<END>
osmund,<END>
no,oswald,<END>
something,like,that,<END>
oppo,met,with,him,not,me,<END>
oppo,made,all,of,our,arrangements,<END>
my,brother,always,knew,what,to,do,where,we,should,go,next,<END>
meereen,is,where,we're,going,next,<END>
she,gave,him,a,puzzled,look,<END>
qarth,you,mean,<END>
we're,bound,for,qarth,by,way,of,new,ghis,<END>
meereen,<END>
you'll,ride,your,dog,for,the,dragon,queen,and,come,away,with,your,weight,in,gold,<END>
best,start,eating,more,so,you'll,be,nice,and,plump,when,you,joust,before,her,grace,<END>
penny,did,not,return,the,smile,<END>
by,myself,all,i,can,do,is,ride,around,in,circles,<END>
and,even,if,the,queen,should,laugh,where,will,i,go,afterward,<END>
we,never,stay,in,one,place,long,<END>
the,first,time,they,see,us,they,laugh,and,laugh,but,by,the,fourth,or,fifth,time,they,know,what,we're,going,to,do,before,we,do,it,<END>
then,they,stop,laughing,so,we,have,to,go,somewhere,new,<END>
we,make,the,most,coin,in,the,big,cities,but,i,always,liked,the,little,towns,the,best,<END>
places,like,that,the,people,have,no,silver,but,they,feed,us,at,their,own,tables,and,the,children,follow,us,everywhere,<END>
that's,because,they,have,never,seen,a,dwarf,before,in,their,wretched,pisspot,towns,tyrion,thought,<END>
the,bloody,brats,would,follow,around,a,two-headed,goat,if,one,turned,up,<END>
until,they,got,bored,with,its,bleating,and,slaughtered,it,for,supper,<END>
but,he,had,no,wish,to,make,her,weep,again,so,instead,he,said,daenerys,has,a,kind,heart,and,a,generous,nature,<END>
it,was,what,she,needed,to,hear,<END>
she,will,find,a,place,for,you,at,her,court,i,don't,doubt,<END>
a,safe,place,beyond,my,sister's,reach,<END>
penny,turned,back,to,him,<END>
and,you,will,be,there,too,<END>
unless,daenerys,decides,she,needs,some,lannister,blood,to,pay,for,the,targaryen,blood,my,brother,shed,<END>
i,will,<END>
after,that,the,dwarf,girl,was,seen,more,frequently,above,deck,<END>
the,next,day,tyrion,encountered,her,and,her,spotted,sow,amidships,in,midafternoon,when,the,air,was,warm,and,the,sea,calm,<END>
her,name,is,pretty,the,girl,told,him,shyly,<END>
pretty,the,pig,and,penny,the,girl,he,thought,<END>
someone,has,a,deal,to,answer,for,<END>
penny,gave,tyrion,some,acorns,and,he,let,pretty,eat,them,from,his,hand,<END>
do,not,think,i,don't,see,what,you,are,doing,girl,he,thought,as,the,big,sow,snuffled,and,squealed,<END>
soon,they,began,to,take,their,meals,together,<END>
some,nights,it,was,just,the,two,of,them,at,other,meals,they,crowded,in,with,moqorro's,guards,<END>
the,fingers,tyrion,called,them,they,were,men,of,the,fiery,hand,after,all,and,there,were,five,of,them,<END>
penny,laughed,at,that,a,sweet,sound,though,not,one,that,he,heard,often,<END>
her,wound,was,too,fresh,her,grief,too,deep,<END>
he,soon,had,her,calling,the,ship,the,stinky,steward,though,she,got,somewhat,wroth,with,him,whenever,he,called,pretty,bacon,<END>
to,atone,for,that,tyrion,made,an,attempt,to,teach,her,cyvasse,though,he,soon,realized,that,was,a,lost,cause,<END>
no,he,said,a,dozen,times,the,dragon,flies,not,the,elephants,<END>
that,same,night,she,came,right,out,and,asked,him,if,he,would,like,to,tilt,with,her,<END>
no,he,answered,<END>
only,later,did,it,occur,to,him,that,perhaps,tilt,did,not,mean,tilt,<END>
his,answer,would,still,have,been,no,but,he,might,not,have,been,so,brusque,<END>
back,in,the,cabin,he,shared,with,jorah,mormont,tyrion,twisted,in,his,hammock,for,hours,slipping,in,and,out,of,sleep,<END>
his,dreams,were,full,of,grey,stony,hands,reaching,for,him,from,out,of,the,fog,and,a,stair,that,led,up,to,his,father,<END>
finally,he,gave,it,up,and,made,his,way,up,top,for,a,breath,of,night,air,<END>
the,selaesori,qhoran,had,furled,her,big,striped,sail,for,the,night,and,her,decks,were,all,but,deserted,<END>
one,of,the,mates,was,on,the,sterncastle,and,amidships,moqorro,sat,by,his,brazier,where,a,few,small,flames,still,danced,amongst,the,embers,<END>
only,the,brightest,stars,were,visible,all,to,the,west,<END>
a,dull,red,glow,lit,the,sky,to,the,northeast,the,color,of,a,blood,bruise,<END>
tyrion,had,never,seen,a,bigger,moon,<END>
monstrous,swollen,it,looked,as,if,it,had,swallowed,the,sun,and,woken,with,a,fever,<END>
its,twin,floating,on,the,sea,beyond,the,ship,shimmered,red,with,every,wave,<END>
what,hour,is,this,<END>
he,asked,moqorro,<END>
that,cannot,be,sunrise,unless,the,east,has,moved,<END>
why,is,the,sky,red,<END>
the,sky,is,always,red,above,valyria,hugor,hill,<END>
a,cold,chill,went,down,his,back,<END>
are,we,close,<END>
closer,than,the,crew,would,like,moqorro,said,in,his,deep,voice,<END>
do,you,know,the,stories,in,your,sunset,kingdoms,<END>
i,know,some,sailors,say,that,any,man,who,lays,eyes,upon,that,coast,is,doomed,<END>
he,did,not,believe,such,tales,himself,no,more,than,his,uncle,had,<END>
gerion,lannister,had,set,sail,for,valyria,when,tyrion,was,eighteen,intent,on,recovering,the,lost,ancestral,blade,of,house,lannister,and,any,other,treasures,that,might,have,survived,the,doom,<END>
tyrion,had,wanted,desperately,to,go,with,them,but,his,lord,father,had,dubbed,the,voyage,a,fool's,quest,and,forbidden,him,to,take,part,<END>
and,perhaps,he,was,not,so,wrong,<END>
almost,a,decade,had,passed,since,the,laughing,lion,headed,out,from,lannisport,and,gerion,had,never,returned,<END>
the,men,lord,tywin,sent,to,seek,after,him,had,traced,his,course,as,far,as,volantis,where,half,his,crew,had,deserted,him,and,he,had,bought,slaves,to,replace,them,<END>
no,free,man,would,willingly,sign,aboard,a,ship,whose,captain,spoke,openly,of,his,intent,to,sail,into,the,smoking,sea,<END>
so,those,are,fires,of,the,fourteen,flames,we're,seeing,reflected,on,the,clouds,<END>
fourteen,or,fourteen,thousand,<END>
what,man,dares,count,them,<END>
it,is,not,wise,for,mortals,to,look,too,deeply,at,those,fires,my,friend,<END>
those,are,the,fires,of,god's,own,wrath,and,no,human,flame,can,match,them,<END>

valyria,<END>
it,was,written,that,on,the,day,of,doom,every,hill,for,five,hundred,miles,had,split,asunder,to,fill,the,air,with,ash,and,smoke,and,fire,blazes,so,hot,and,hungry,that,even,the,dragons,in,the,sky,were,engulfed,and,consumed,<END>

our,captain,would,prefer,to,be,fifty,leagues,farther,out,to,sea,well,away,from,that,accursed,shore,but,i,have,commanded,him,to,steer,the,shortest,course,<END>
others,seek,daenerys,too,<END>
griff,with,his,young,prince,<END>
could,all,that,talk,of,the,golden,company,sailing,west,have,been,a,feint,<END>
tyrion,considered,saying,something,then,thought,better,<END>
it,seemed,to,him,that,the,prophecy,that,drove,the,red,priests,had,room,for,just,one,hero,<END>
a,second,targaryen,would,only,serve,to,confuse,them,<END>
have,you,seen,these,others,in,your,fires,<END>

only,their,shadows,moqorro,said,<END>

lord,eddard,seemed,much,younger,this,time,<END>
his,hair,was,brown,with,no,hint,of,grey,in,it,his,head,bowed,<END>
let,them,grow,up,close,as,brothers,with,only,love,between,them,he,prayed,and,let,my,lady,wife,find,it,in,her,heart,to,forgive,father,<END>

eddard,stark,lifted,his,head,and,looked,long,at,the,weirwood,frowning,but,he,did,not,speak,<END>
he,cannot,see,me,bran,realized,despairing,<END>
he,wanted,to,reach,out,and,touch,him,but,all,that,he,could,do,was,watch,and,listen,<END>
i,am,in,the,tree,<END>
i,am,inside,the,heart,tree,looking,out,of,its,red,eyes,but,the,weirwood,cannot,talk,so,i,can't,<END>
eddard,stark,resumed,his,prayer,<END>

but,were,they,his,own,tears,or,the,weirwood's,<END>
if,i,cry,will,the,tree,begin,to,weep,<END>
the,rest,of,his,father's,words,were,drowned,out,by,a,sudden,clatter,of,wood,on,wood,<END>
eddard,stark,dissolved,like,mist,in,a,morning,sun,<END>
now,two,children,danced,across,the,godswood,hooting,at,one,another,as,they,dueled,with,broken,branches,<END>
the,girl,was,the,older,and,taller,of,the,two,<END>
arya,<END>
bran,thought,eagerly,as,he,watched,her,leap,up,onto,a,rock,and,cut,at,the,boy,<END>
but,that,couldn't,be,right,<END>
if,the,girl,was,arya,the,boy,was,bran,himself,and,he,had,never,worn,his,hair,so,long,<END>
and,arya,never,beat,me,playing,swords,the,way,that,girl,is,beating,him,<END>
she,slashed,the,boy,across,his,thigh,so,hard,that,his,leg,went,out,from,under,him,and,he,fell,into,the,pool,and,began,to,splash,and,shout,<END>
you,be,quiet,stupid,the,girl,said,tossing,her,own,branch,aside,<END>
it's,just,water,<END>
do,you,want,old,nan,to,hear,and,run,tell,father,<END>
she,knelt,and,pulled,her,brother,from,the,pool,but,before,she,got,him,out,again,the,two,of,them,were,gone,<END>
after,that,the,glimpses,came,faster,and,faster,till,bran,was,feeling,lost,and,dizzy,<END>
he,saw,no,more,of,his,father,nor,the,girl,who,looked,like,arya,but,a,woman,heavy,with,child,emerged,naked,and,dripping,from,the,black,pool,knelt,before,the,tree,and,begged,the,old,gods,for,a,son,who,would,avenge,her,<END>
then,there,came,a,brown-haired,girl,slender,as,a,spear,who,stood,on,the,tips,of,her,toes,to,kiss,the,lips,of,a,young,knight,as,tall,as,hodor,<END>
a,dark-eyed,youth,pale,and,fierce,sliced,three,branches,off,the,weirwood,and,shaped,them,into,arrows,<END>
the,tree,itself,was,shrinking,growing,smaller,with,each,vision,whilst,the,lesser,trees,dwindled,into,saplings,and,vanished,only,to,be,replaced,by,other,trees,that,would,dwindle,and,vanish,in,their,turn,<END>

some,wore,faces,he,remembered,from,the,statues,in,the,crypts,but,they,were,gone,before,he,could,put,a,name,to,them,<END>
then,as,he,watched,a,bearded,man,forced,a,captive,down,onto,his,knees,before,the,heart,tree,<END>
a,white-haired,woman,stepped,toward,them,through,a,drift,of,dark,red,leaves,a,bronze,sickle,in,her,hand,<END>
no,said,bran,no,don't,but,they,could,not,hear,him,no,more,than,his,father,had,<END>
the,woman,grabbed,the,captive,by,the,hair,hooked,the,sickle,round,his,throat,and,slashed,<END>
and,through,the,mist,of,centuries,the,broken,boy,could,only,watch,as,the,man's,feet,drummed,against,the,earth,but,as,his,life,flowed,out,of,him,in,a,red,tide,brandon,stark,could,taste,the,blood,<END>

reflections,glimmered,off,the,wall,every,crack,and,crevice,glittering,pale,blue,<END>
seven,hundred,feet,up,jon,snow,stood,looking,down,upon,the,haunted,forest,<END>
a,north,wind,swirled,through,the,trees,below,sending,thin,white,plumes,of,snow,crystals,flying,from,the,highest,branches,like,icy,banners,<END>

not,a,sign,of,life,<END>

he,watched,the,sand,snakes,each,at,a,different,table,<END>
he,watched,the,lords,and,ladies,the,serving,men,the,old,blind,seneschal,and,the,young,maester,myles,with,his,silky,beard,and,servile,smile,<END>
standing,half,in,light,and,half,in,shadow,he,saw,all,of,them,<END>

that,was,his,task,<END>
all,the,rest,had,eyes,only,for,the,chest,<END>
it,was,carved,of,ebony,with,silver,clasps,and,hinges,<END>
a,fine-looking,box,no,doubt,but,many,of,those,assembled,here,in,the,old,palace,of,sunspear,might,soon,be,dead,depending,on,what,was,in,that,chest,<END>
his,slippers,whispering,against,the,floor,maester,caleotte,crossed,the,hall,to,ser,balon,swann,<END>

bowing,he,took,the,chest,from,the,hands,of,the,white,knight,and,carried,it,to,the,dais,where,doran,martell,sat,in,his,rolling,chair,between,his,daughter,arianne,and,his,dead,brother's,beloved,paramour,ellaria,<END>

the,maester's,fingers,normally,so,sure,and,deft,turned,clumsy,as,he,worked,the,latch,and,opened,the,lid,to,reveal,the,skull,within,<END>

one,of,the,fowler,twins,whispered,something,to,the,other,<END>

ser,balon,swann,was,taut,as,a,drawn,bow,the,captain,of,guards,observed,<END>
this,new,white,knight,was,not,so,tall,nor,comely,as,the,old,one,but,he,was,bigger,across,the,chest,burlier,his,arms,thick,with,muscle,<END>
his,snowy,cloak,was,clasped,at,the,throat,by,two,swans,on,a,silver,brooch,<END>
one,was,ivory,the,other,onyx,and,it,seemed,to,areo,hotah,as,if,the,two,of,them,were,fighting,<END>
the,man,who,wore,them,looked,a,fighter,too,<END>
this,one,will,not,die,so,easy,as,the,other,<END>

he,allowed,himself,a,brief,glance,at,the,chest,<END>
the,skull,rested,on,a,bed,of,black,felt,grinning,<END>
all,skulls,grinned,but,this,one,seemed,happier,than,most,<END>
and,bigger,<END>
the,captain,of,guards,had,never,seen,a,larger,skull,<END>
its,brow,shelf,was,thick,and,heavy,its,jaw,massive,<END>
the,bone,shone,in,the,candlelight,white,as,ser,balon's,cloak,<END>
place,it,on,the,pedestal,the,prince,commanded,<END>
he,had,tears,glistening,in,his,eyes,<END>
the,pedestal,was,a,column,of,black,marble,three,feet,taller,than,maester,caleotte,<END>
the,fat,little,maester,hopped,up,on,his,toes,but,still,could,not,quite,reach,<END>
areo,hotah,was,about,to,go,and,help,him,but,obara,sand,moved,first,<END>
even,without,her,whip,and,shield,she,had,an,angry,mannish,look,to,her,<END>
in,place,of,a,gown,she,wore,men's,breeches,and,a,calf-length,linen,tunic,cinched,at,the,waist,with,a,belt,of,copper,suns,<END>
her,brown,hair,was,tied,back,in,a,knot,<END>

we,could,hear,him,all,over,the,red,keep,<END>
does,that,trouble,you,ser,<END>
asked,the,lady,nym,<END>
she,wore,a,gown,of,yellow,silk,so,sheer,and,fine,that,the,candles,shone,right,through,it,to,reveal,the,spun,gold,and,jewels,beneath,<END>
so,immodest,was,her,garb,that,the,white,knight,seemed,uncomfortable,looking,at,her,but,hotah,approved,<END>

elsewise,she,was,sure,to,have,a,dozen,blades,concealed,about,her,person,<END>

poison,is,a,foul,and,filthy,way,to,kill,<END>
lady,tyene,smiled,at,that,<END>
her,gown,was,cream,and,green,with,long,lace,sleeves,so,modest,and,so,innocent,that,any,man,who,looked,at,her,might,think,her,the,most,chaste,of,maids,<END>
areo,hotah,knew,better,<END>
her,soft,pale,hands,were,as,deadly,as,obara's,callused,ones,if,not,more,so,<END>

that,is,so,ser,balon,but,the,lady,nym,is,right,<END>
if,ever,a,man,deserved,to,die,screaming,it,was,gregor,clegane,<END>

at,long,last,the,lannisters,have,proved,the,truth,of,their,boast,and,paid,this,old,blood,debt,<END>
the,prince,left,it,to,ricasso,his,blind,seneschal,to,rise,and,propose,the,toast,<END>
lords,and,ladies,let,us,all,now,drink,to,tommen,the,first,of,his,name,king,of,the,andals,the,rhoynar,and,the,first,men,and,lord,of,the,seven,kingdoms,<END>
serving,men,had,begun,to,move,amongst,the,guests,as,the,seneschal,was,speaking,filling,cups,from,the,flagons,that,they,bore,<END>
the,wine,was,dornish,strongwine,dark,as,blood,and,sweet,as,vengeance,<END>
the,captain,did,not,drink,of,it,<END>
he,never,drank,at,feasts,<END>
nor,did,the,prince,himself,partake,<END>
he,had,his,own,wine,prepared,by,maester,myles,and,well,laced,with,poppy,juice,to,ease,the,agony,in,his,swollen,joints,<END>
the,white,knight,did,drink,as,was,only,courteous,<END>
his,companions,likewise,<END>
so,did,the,princess,arianne,lady,jordayne,the,lord,of,godsgrace,the,knight,of,lemonwood,the,lady,of,ghost,hill,even,ellaria,sand,prince,oberyn's,beloved,paramour,who,had,been,with,him,in,king's,landing,when,he,died,<END>

if,there,is,trouble,it,could,start,with,one,of,them,<END>
dorne,was,an,angry,and,divided,land,and,prince,doran's,hold,on,it,was,not,as,firm,as,it,might,be,<END>
many,of,his,own,lords,thought,him,weak,and,would,have,welcomed,open,war,with,the,lannisters,and,the,boy,king,on,the,iron,throne,<END>
chief,amongst,those,were,the,sand,snakes,the,bastard,daughters,of,the,prince's,late,brother,oberyn,the,red,viper,three,of,whom,were,at,the,feast,<END>
doran,martell,was,the,wisest,of,princes,and,it,was,not,the,place,of,his,captain,of,guards,to,question,his,decisions,but,areo,hotah,did,wonder,why,he,had,chosen,to,release,the,ladies,obara,nymeria,and,tyene,from,their,lonely,cells,in,the,spear,tower,<END>
tyene,declined,ricasso's,toast,with,a,murmur,and,lady,nym,with,a,flick,of,a,hand,<END>
obara,let,them,fill,her,cup,to,the,brim,then,upended,it,to,spill,the,red,wine,on,the,floor,<END>
when,a,serving,girl,knelt,to,wipe,up,the,spilled,wine,obara,left,the,hall,<END>
after,a,moment,princess,arianne,excused,herself,and,went,after,her,<END>
obara,would,never,turn,her,rage,on,the,little,princess,hotah,knew,<END>
they,are,cousins,and,she,loves,her,well,<END>
the,feast,continued,late,into,the,night,presided,over,by,the,grinning,skull,on,its,pillar,of,black,marble,<END>
seven,courses,were,served,in,honor,of,the,seven,gods,and,the,seven,brothers,of,the,kingsguard,<END>
the,soup,was,made,with,eggs,and,lemons,the,long,green,peppers,stuffed,with,cheese,and,onions,<END>
there,were,lamprey,pies,capons,glazed,with,honey,a,whiskerfish,from,the,bottom,of,the,greenblood,that,was,so,big,it,took,four,serving,men,to,carry,it,to,table,<END>
after,that,came,a,savory,snake,stew,chunks,of,seven,different,sorts,of,snake,slow-simmered,with,dragon,peppers,and,blood,oranges,and,a,dash,of,venom,to,give,it,a,good,bite,<END>
the,stew,was,fiery,hot,hotah,knew,though,he,tasted,none,of,it,<END>
sherbet,followed,to,cool,the,tongue,<END>
for,the,sweet,each,guest,was,served,a,skull,of,spun,sugar,<END>
when,the,crust,was,broken,they,found,sweet,custard,inside,and,bits,of,plum,and,cherry,<END>
princess,arianne,returned,in,time,for,the,stuffed,peppers,<END>
my,little,princess,hotah,thought,but,arianne,was,a,woman,now,<END>
the,scarlet,silks,she,wore,left,no,doubt,of,that,<END>
of,late,she,had,changed,in,other,ways,as,well,<END>
her,plot,to,crown,myrcella,had,been,betrayed,and,smashed,her,white,knight,had,perished,bloodily,at,hotah's,hand,and,she,herself,had,been,confined,to,the,spear,tower,condemned,to,solitude,and,silence,<END>
all,of,that,had,chastened,her,<END>
there,was,something,else,as,well,though,some,secret,her,father,had,confided,in,her,before,releasing,her,from,her,confinement,<END>
what,that,was,the,captain,did,not,know,<END>
the,prince,had,placed,his,daughter,between,himself,and,the,white,knight,a,place,of,high,honor,<END>
arianne,smiled,as,she,slipped,into,her,seat,again,and,murmured,something,in,ser,balon's,ear,<END>
the,knight,did,not,choose,to,respond,<END>
he,ate,little,hotah,observed,a,spoon,of,soup,a,bite,of,the,pepper,the,leg,off,a,capon,some,fish,<END>
he,shunned,the,lamprey,pie,and,tried,only,one,small,spoonful,of,the,stew,<END>
even,that,made,his,brow,break,out,in,sweat,<END>
hotah,could,sympathize,<END>
when,first,he,came,to,dorne,the,fiery,food,would,tie,his,bowels,in,knots,and,burn,his,tongue,<END>
that,was,years,ago,however,now,his,hair,was,white,and,he,could,eat,anything,a,dornishman,could,eat,<END>
when,the,spun-sugar,skulls,were,served,ser,balon's,mouth,grew,tight,and,he,gave,the,prince,a,lingering,look,to,see,if,he,was,being,mocked,<END>
doran,martell,took,no,notice,but,his,daughter,did,<END>
it,is,the,cook's,little,jape,ser,balon,said,arianne,<END>
even,death,is,not,sacred,to,a,dornishmen,<END>
you,won't,be,cross,with,us,i,pray,<END>
she,brushed,the,back,of,the,white,knight's,hand,with,her,fingers,<END>
i,hope,you,have,enjoyed,your,time,in,dorne,<END>
everyone,has,been,most,hospitable,my,lady,<END>

no,other,bird,is,half,so,beautiful,this,side,of,the,summer,isles,<END>
your,peacocks,might,dispute,that,said,ser,balon,<END>
they,might,said,arianne,but,peacocks,are,vain,proud,creatures,strutting,about,in,all,those,gaudy,colors,<END>
give,me,a,swan,serene,in,white,or,beautiful,in,black,<END>
ser,balon,gave,a,nod,and,sipped,his,wine,<END>
this,one,is,not,so,easily,seduced,as,was,his,sworn,brother,hotah,thought,<END>
ser,arys,was,a,boy,despite,his,years,<END>
this,one,is,a,man,and,wary,<END>
the,captain,had,only,to,look,at,him,to,see,that,the,white,knight,was,ill,at,ease,<END>
this,place,is,strange,to,him,and,little,to,his,liking,<END>
hotah,could,understand,that,<END>
dorne,had,seemed,a,queer,place,to,him,as,well,when,first,he,came,here,with,his,own,princess,many,years,ago,<END>
the,bearded,priests,had,drilled,him,on,the,common,speech,of,westeros,before,they,sent,him,forth,but,the,dornishmen,all,spoke,too,quickly,for,him,to,understand,<END>
dornish,women,were,lewd,dornish,wine,was,sour,and,dornish,food,was,full,of,queer,hot,spices,<END>
and,the,dornish,sun,was,hotter,than,the,pale,wan,sun,of,norvos,glaring,down,from,a,blue,sky,day,after,day,<END>
ser,balon's,journey,had,been,shorter,but,troubling,in,its,own,way,the,captain,knew,<END>
three,knights,eight,squires,twenty,men-at-arms,and,sundry,grooms,and,servants,had,accompanied,him,from,king's,landing,but,once,they,crossed,the,mountains,into,dorne,their,progress,had,been,slowed,by,a,round,of,feasts,hunts,and,celebrations,at,every,castle,that,they,chanced,to,pass,<END>
and,now,that,they,had,reached,sunspear,neither,princess,myrcella,nor,ser,arys,oakheart,was,on,hand,to,greet,them,<END>
the,white,knight,knows,that,something,is,amiss,hotah,could,tell,but,it,is,more,than,that,<END>
perhaps,the,presence,of,the,sand,snakes,unnerved,him,<END>
if,so,obara's,return,to,the,hall,must,have,been,vinegar,in,the,wound,<END>
she,slipped,back,into,her,place,without,a,word,and,sat,there,sullen,and,scowling,neither,smiling,nor,speaking,<END>
midnight,was,close,at,hand,when,prince,doran,turned,to,the,white,knight,and,said,ser,balon,i,have,read,the,letter,that,you,brought,me,from,our,gracious,queen,<END>
might,i,assume,that,you,are,familiar,with,its,contents,ser,<END>
hotah,saw,the,knight,tense,<END>
i,am,my,lord,<END>
her,grace,informed,me,that,i,might,be,called,upon,to,escort,her,daughter,back,to,king's,landing,<END>
king,tommen,has,been,pining,for,his,sister,and,would,like,princess,myrcella,to,return,to,court,for,a,short,visit,<END>
princess,arianne,made,a,sad,face,<END>
oh,but,we,have,all,grown,so,fond,of,myrcella,ser,<END>
she,and,my,brother,trystane,have,become,inseparable,<END>
prince,trystane,would,be,welcome,in,king's,landing,as,well,said,balon,swann,<END>
king,tommen,would,wish,to,meet,him,i,am,sure,<END>
his,grace,has,so,few,companions,near,his,own,age,<END>
the,bonds,formed,in,boyhood,can,last,a,man,for,life,said,prince,doran,<END>
when,trystane,and,myrcella,wed,he,and,tommen,will,be,as,brothers,<END>
queen,cersei,has,the,right,of,it,<END>
the,boys,should,meet,become,friends,<END>
dorne,will,miss,him,to,be,sure,but,it,is,past,time,trystane,saw,something,of,the,world,beyond,the,walls,of,sunspear,<END>
i,know,king's,landing,will,welcome,him,most,warmly,<END>
why,is,he,sweating,now,<END>
the,captain,wondered,watching,<END>
the,hall,is,cool,enough,and,he,never,touched,the,stew,<END>
as,for,the,other,matter,that,queen,cersei,raises,prince,doran,was,saying,it,is,true,dorne's,seat,upon,the,small,council,has,been,vacant,since,my,brother's,death,and,it,is,past,time,that,it,was,filled,again,<END>
i,am,flattered,that,her,grace,feels,my,counsel,might,be,of,use,to,her,though,i,wonder,if,i,have,the,strength,for,such,a,journey,<END>
perhaps,if,we,went,by,sea,<END>
by,ship,<END>
ser,balon,seemed,taken,aback,<END>
that,would,that,be,safe,my,prince,<END>
autumn,is,a,bad,season,for,storms,or,so,i've,heard,and,the,pirates,in,the,stepstones,they,the,pirates,<END>
to,be,sure,<END>
you,may,be,right,ser,<END>
safer,to,return,the,way,you,came,<END>
prince,doran,smiled,pleasantly,<END>
let,us,talk,again,on,the,morrow,<END>
when,we,reach,the,water,gardens,we,can,tell,myrcella,<END>
i,know,how,excited,she,will,be,<END>
she,misses,her,brother,too,i,do,not,doubt,<END>
i,am,eager,to,see,her,once,again,said,ser,balon,<END>
and,to,visit,your,water,gardens,<END>
i've,heard,they,are,very,beautiful,<END>
beautiful,and,peaceful,the,prince,said,<END>
cool,breezes,sparkling,water,and,the,laughter,of,children,<END>
the,water,gardens,are,my,favorite,place,in,this,world,ser,<END>
one,of,my,ancestors,had,them,built,to,please,his,targaryen,bride,and,free,her,from,the,dust,and,heat,of,sunspear,<END>
daenerys,was,her,name,<END>
she,was,sister,to,king,daeron,the,good,and,it,was,her,marriage,that,made,dorne,part,of,the,seven,kingdoms,<END>
the,whole,realm,knew,that,the,girl,loved,daeron's,bastard,brother,daemon,blackfyre,and,was,loved,by,him,in,turn,but,the,king,was,wise,enough,to,see,that,the,good,of,thousands,must,come,before,the,desires,of,two,even,if,those,two,were,dear,to,him,<END>
it,was,daenerys,who,filled,the,gardens,with,laughing,children,<END>
her,own,children,at,the,start,but,later,the,sons,and,daughters,of,lords,and,landed,knights,were,brought,in,to,be,companions,to,the,boys,and,girls,of,princely,blood,<END>
and,one,summer's,day,when,it,was,scorching,hot,she,took,pity,on,the,children,of,her,grooms,and,cooks,and,serving,men,and,invited,them,to,use,the,pools,and,fountains,too,a,tradition,that,has,endured,till,this,day,<END>
the,prince,grasped,the,wheels,of,his,chair,and,pushed,himself,from,the,table,<END>
but,now,you,must,excuse,me,ser,<END>
all,this,talk,has,wearied,me,and,we,should,leave,at,break,of,day,<END>
obara,would,you,be,so,kind,as,to,help,me,to,my,bed,<END>
nymeria,tyene,come,as,well,and,bid,your,old,uncle,a,fond,good,night,<END>
so,it,fell,to,obara,sand,to,roll,the,prince's,chair,from,sunspear's,feast,hall,and,down,a,long,gallery,to,his,solar,<END>
areo,hotah,followed,with,her,sisters,along,with,princess,arianne,and,ellaria,sand,<END>
maester,caleotte,hurried,behind,on,slippered,feet,cradling,the,mountain's,skull,as,if,it,were,a,child,<END>
you,cannot,seriously,intend,to,send,trystane,and,myrcella,to,king's,landing,obara,said,as,she,was,pushing,<END>
her,strides,were,long,and,angry,much,too,fast,and,the,chair's,big,wooden,wheels,clacked,noisily,across,rough-cut,stone,floors,<END>
do,that,and,we,will,never,see,the,girl,again,and,your,son,will,spend,his,life,a,hostage,to,the,iron,throne,<END>
do,you,take,me,for,a,fool,obara,<END>
the,prince,sighed,<END>

she,is,a,good,woman,<END>
when,she,had,gone,lady,nym,said,i,know,she,loved,our,father,well,but,it,is,plain,she,never,understood,him,<END>
the,prince,gave,her,a,curious,look,<END>
she,understood,more,than,you,ever,will,nymeria,<END>

procrastinate,obscure,prevaricate,dissemble,and,delay,all,you,like,uncle,ser,balon,must,still,come,face-to-face,with,myrcella,at,the,water,gardens,and,when,he,does,he's,like,to,see,she's,short,an,ear,<END>
and,when,the,girl,tells,him,how,your,captain,cut,arys,oakheart,from,neck,to,groin,with,that,steel,wife,of,his,well,no,<END>

he,tried,to,kill,princess,myrcella,too,<END>
as,she,will,tell,ser,balon,<END>

that,part,at,least,is,true,<END>

it,is,all,his,doing,<END>
but,will,ser,balon,believe,it,<END>

she,may,lie,today,and,lie,tomorrow,but,soon,or,late,she'll,tell,the,truth,<END>
if,ser,balon,is,allowed,to,carry,tales,back,to,king's,landing,drums,will,sound,and,blood,will,flow,<END>
he,should,not,be,allowed,to,leave,<END>
we,could,kill,him,to,be,sure,said,tyene,but,then,we,would,need,to,kill,the,rest,of,his,party,too,even,those,sweet,young,squires,<END>
that,would,be,oh,so,messy,<END>
prince,doran,shut,his,eyes,and,opened,them,again,<END>
hotah,could,see,his,leg,trembling,underneath,the,blanket,<END>
if,you,were,not,my,brother's,daughters,i,would,send,the,three,of,you,back,to,your,cells,and,keep,you,there,until,your,bones,were,grey,<END>

there,are,lessons,there,if,you,have,the,wit,to,see,them,<END>
lessons,<END>
said,obara,<END>
all,i've,seen,are,naked,children,<END>
aye,the,prince,said,<END>
i,told,the,story,to,ser,balon,but,not,all,of,it,<END>
as,the,children,splashed,in,the,pools,daenerys,watched,from,amongst,the,orange,trees,and,a,realization,came,to,her,<END>
she,could,not,tell,the,highborn,from,the,low,<END>
naked,they,were,only,children,<END>
all,innocent,all,vulnerable,all,deserving,of,long,life,love,protection,<END>
there,is,your,realm,',she,told,her,son,and,heir,remember,them,in,everything,you,do,',<END>
my,own,mother,said,those,same,words,to,me,when,i,was,old,enough,to,leave,the,pools,<END>
it,is,an,easy,thing,for,a,prince,to,call,the,spears,but,in,the,end,the,children,pay,the,price,<END>
for,their,sake,the,wise,prince,will,wage,no,war,without,good,cause,nor,any,war,he,cannot,hope,to,win,<END>
i,am,not,blind,nor,deaf,<END>
i,know,that,you,all,believe,me,weak,frightened,feeble,<END>

your,father,and,i,worked,more,closely,than,you,know,but,now,he,is,gone,<END>
the,question,is,can,i,trust,his,daughters,to,serve,me,in,his,place,<END>
hotah,studied,each,of,them,in,turn,<END>
obara,rusted,nails,and,boiled,leather,with,her,angry,close-set,eyes,and,rat-brown,hair,<END>

i,had,my,doubts,as,well,but,you,all,saw,how,ser,balon,balked,when,i,suggested,that,we,go,by,sea,<END>
a,ship,would,have,disturbed,all,the,queen's,arrangements,<END>

that,was,quick,<END>
he,wondered,who,was,telling,tales,and,if,there,was,more,than,one,<END>
send,them,in,<END>
aye,m'lord,<END>
you'll,want,to,watch,your,sausages,with,this,lot,though,<END>
they,have,a,hungry,look,about,them,<END>
hungry,was,not,the,word,jon,would,have,used,<END>
septon,cellador,appeared,confused,and,groggy,and,in,dire,need,of,some,scales,from,the,dragon,that,had,flamed,him,whilst,first,builder,othell,yarwyck,looked,as,if,he,had,swallowed,something,he,could,not,quite,digest,<END>

i,have,had,a,letter,from,ser,axell,florent,who,styles,himself,the,queen's,hand,<END>

will,that,be,possible,<END>
yarwyck,shrugged,<END>
we've,got,most,of,the,keep,restored,and,put,a,roof,back,on,the,kitchens,<END>
she'd,need,food,and,furnishings,and,firewood,mind,you,but,it,might,serve,<END>
not,so,many,comforts,as,eastwatch,to,be,sure,<END>
and,a,long,way,from,the,ships,should,her,grace,wish,to,leave,us,but,aye,she,could,live,there,though,it,will,be,years,before,the,place,looks,a,proper,castle,<END>
sooner,if,i,had,more,builders,<END>
i,could,offer,you,a,giant,<END>

the,monster,in,the,yard,<END>
his,name,is,wun,weg,wun,dar,wun,leathers,tells,me,<END>
a,lot,to,wrap,a,tongue,around,i,know,<END>
leathers,calls,him,wun,wun,and,that,seems,to,serve,<END>
wun,wun,was,very,little,like,the,giants,in,old,nan's,tales,those,huge,savage,creatures,who,mixed,blood,into,their,morning,porridge,and,devoured,whole,bulls,hair,and,hide,and,horns,<END>
this,giant,ate,no,meat,at,all,though,he,was,a,holy,terror,when,served,a,basket,of,roots,crunching,onions,and,turnips,and,even,raw,hard,neeps,between,his,big,square,teeth,<END>
he's,a,willing,worker,though,getting,him,to,understand,what,you,want,is,not,always,easy,<END>
he,speaks,the,old,tongue,after,a,fashion,but,nothing,of,the,common,<END>
tireless,though,and,his,strength,is,prodigious,<END>
he,could,do,the,work,of,a,dozen,men,<END>
i,my,lord,the,men,would,never,giants,eat,human,flesh,i,think,no,my,lord,i,thank,you,but,i,do,not,have,the,men,to,watch,over,such,a,creature,he,jon,snow,was,unsurprised,<END>
as,you,wish,<END>
we,will,keep,the,giant,here,<END>
truth,be,told,he,would,have,been,loath,to,part,with,wun,wun,<END>
you,know,nothing,jon,snow,ygritte,might,say,but,jon,spoke,with,the,giant,whenever,he,could,through,leathers,or,one,of,the,free,folk,they,had,brought,back,from,the,grove,and,was,learning,much,and,more,about,his,people,and,their,history,<END>
he,only,wished,that,sam,were,here,to,write,the,stories,down,<END>
that,was,not,to,say,that,he,was,blind,to,the,danger,wun,wun,represented,<END>
the,giant,would,lash,out,violently,when,threatened,and,those,huge,hands,were,strong,enough,to,rip,a,man,apart,<END>
he,reminded,jon,of,hodor,<END>
hodor,twice,as,big,twice,as,strong,and,half,as,clever,<END>
there's,a,thought,to,sober,even,septon,cellador,<END>
but,if,tormund,has,giants,with,him,wun,weg,wun,dar,wun,may,help,us,treat,with,them,<END>
mormont's,raven,muttered,his,annoyance,as,the,door,opened,beneath,him,heralding,the,return,of,dolorous,edd,with,a,flagon,of,wine,and,a,plate,of,eggs,and,sausages,<END>

yet,the,talk,is,that,you,mean,to,send,them,away,<END>
we,need,good,men,at,long,barrow,<END>
whore's,hole,the,men,have,started,calling,it,said,marsh,but,be,that,as,it,may,<END>
is,it,true,that,you,mean,to,replace,emmett,with,this,savage,leathers,as,our,master-at-arms,<END>
that,is,an,office,most,oft,reserved,for,knights,or,rangers,at,the,least,<END>
leathers,is,savage,jon,agreed,mildly,<END>
i,can,attest,to,that,<END>
i've,tried,him,in,the,practice,yard,<END>
he's,as,dangerous,with,a,stone,axe,as,most,knights,are,with,castle-forged,steel,<END>
i,grant,you,he,is,not,as,patient,as,i'd,like,and,some,of,the,boys,are,terrified,of,him,but,that's,not,all,for,the,bad,<END>
one,day,they'll,find,themselves,in,a,real,fight,and,a,certain,familiarity,with,terror,will,serve,them,well,<END>
he's,a,wildling,<END>
he,was,until,he,said,the,words,<END>
now,he,is,our,brother,<END>
one,who,can,teach,the,boys,more,than,swordcraft,<END>
it,would,not,hurt,them,to,learn,a,few,words,of,the,old,tongue,and,something,of,the,ways,of,the,free,folk,<END>

what,he,was,in,oldtown,is,none,of,our,concern,<END>
he's,quick,to,learn,and,very,clever,<END>
the,other,recruits,started,out,despising,him,but,he,won,them,over,and,made,friends,of,them,all,<END>
he's,fearless,in,a,fight,and,can,even,read,and,write,after,a,fashion,<END>
he,should,be,capable,of,fetching,me,my,meals,and,saddling,my,horse,don't,you,think,<END>
most,like,said,bowen,marsh,stony-faced,but,the,men,do,not,like,it,<END>

tyrion,<END>
the,sow,had,a,sweeter,temper,than,some,horses,he,had,ridden,<END>
patient,and,sure-footed,she,accepted,tyrion,with,hardly,a,squeal,when,he,clambered,onto,her,back,and,remained,motionless,as,he,reached,for,shield,and,lance,<END>
yet,when,he,gathered,up,her,reins,and,pressed,his,feet,into,her,side,she,moved,at,once,<END>
her,name,was,pretty,short,for,pretty,pig,and,she,had,been,trained,to,saddle,and,bridle,since,she,was,a,piglet,<END>
the,painted,wooden,armor,clattered,as,pretty,trotted,across,the,deck,<END>
tyrion's,armpits,were,prickly,with,perspiration,and,a,bead,of,sweat,was,trickling,down,his,scar,beneath,the,oversized,ill-fitting,helm,yet,for,one,absurd,moment,he,felt,almost,like,jaime,riding,out,onto,a,tourney,field,with,lance,in,hand,his,golden,armor,flashing,in,the,sun,<END>
when,the,laughter,began,the,dream,dissolved,<END>
he,was,no,champion,just,a,dwarf,on,a,pig,clutching,a,stick,capering,for,the,amusement,of,some,restless,rum-soaked,sailors,in,hopes,of,sweetening,their,mood,<END>
somewhere,down,in,hell,his,father,was,seething,and,joffrey,was,chuckling,<END>
tyrion,could,feel,their,cold,dead,eyes,watching,this,mummer's,face,as,avid,as,the,crew,of,the,selaesori,qhoran,<END>
and,now,here,came,his,foe,<END>
penny,rode,her,big,grey,dog,her,striped,lance,waving,drunkenly,as,the,beast,bounded,across,the,deck,<END>
her,shield,and,armor,had,been,painted,red,though,the,paint,was,chipped,and,fading,his,own,armor,was,blue,<END>

never,mine,i,pray,<END>
tyrion,kicked,at,pretty's,haunches,to,speed,her,to,a,charge,as,the,sailors,urged,him,on,with,hoots,and,shouts,<END>
whether,they,were,shouting,encouragement,or,mocking,him,he,could,not,have,said,for,certain,though,he,had,a,fair,notion,<END>
why,did,i,ever,allow,myself,to,be,talked,into,this,farce,<END>
he,knew,the,answer,though,<END>
for,twelve,days,now,the,ship,had,floated,becalmed,in,the,gulf,of,grief,<END>
the,mood,of,the,crew,was,ugly,and,like,to,turn,uglier,when,their,daily,rum,ration,went,dry,<END>
there,were,only,so,many,hours,a,man,could,devote,to,mending,sails,caulking,leaks,and,fishing,<END>
jorah,mormont,had,heard,the,muttering,about,how,dwarf,luck,had,failed,them,<END>
whilst,the,ship's,cook,still,gave,tyrion's,head,a,rub,from,time,to,time,in,hopes,that,it,might,stir,a,wind,the,rest,had,taken,to,giving,him,venomous,looks,whenever,he,crossed,their,paths,<END>
penny's,lot,was,even,worse,since,the,cook,had,put,about,the,notion,that,squeezing,a,dwarf,girl's,breast,might,be,just,the,thing,to,win,their,luck,back,<END>
he,had,also,started,referring,to,pretty,pig,as,bacon,a,jape,that,had,seemed,much,funnier,when,tyrion,had,made,it,<END>
we,have,to,make,them,laugh,penny,had,said,pleading,<END>
we,have,to,make,them,like,us,<END>
if,we,give,them,a,show,it,will,help,them,forget,<END>
please,m'lord,<END>
and,somehow,somewise,someway,he,had,consented,<END>
it,must,have,been,the,rum,<END>
the,captain's,wine,had,been,the,first,thing,to,run,out,<END>
you,could,get,drunk,much,quicker,on,rum,than,on,wine,tyrion,lannister,had,discovered,<END>
so,he,found,himself,clad,in,groat's,painted,wooden,armor,astride,groat's,sow,whilst,groat's,sister,instructed,him,in,the,finer,points,of,the,mummer's,joust,that,had,been,their,bread,and,salt,<END>
it,had,a,certain,delicious,irony,to,it,considering,that,tyrion,had,almost,lost,his,head,once,by,refusing,to,mount,the,dog,for,his,nephew's,twisted,amusement,<END>
yet,somehow,he,found,it,difficult,to,appreciate,the,humor,of,it,all,from,sowback,<END>
penny's,lance,descended,just,in,time,for,its,blunted,point,to,brush,his,shoulder,his,own,lance,wobbled,as,he,brought,it,down,and,banged,it,noisily,off,a,corner,of,her,shield,<END>
she,kept,her,seat,<END>
he,lost,his,<END>
but,then,he,was,supposed,to,<END>
easy,as,falling,off,a,pig,though,falling,off,this,particular,pig,was,harder,than,it,looked,<END>
tyrion,curled,into,a,ball,as,he,dropped,remembering,his,lesson,but,even,so,he,hit,the,deck,with,a,solid,thump,and,bit,his,tongue,so,hard,he,tasted,blood,<END>
he,felt,as,if,he,were,twelve,again,cartwheeling,across,the,supper,table,in,casterly,rock's,great,hall,<END>
back,then,his,uncle,gerion,had,been,on,hand,to,praise,his,efforts,in,place,of,surly,sailors,<END>
their,laughter,seemed,sparse,and,strained,compared,to,the,great,gales,that,had,greeted,groat's,and,penny's,antics,at,joffrey's,wedding,feast,and,some,hissed,at,him,in,anger,<END>
no-nose,you,ride,same,way,you,look,ugly,one,man,shouted,from,the,sterncastle,<END>
must,have,no,balls,let,girl,beat,you,<END>
he,wagered,coin,on,me,tyrion,decided,<END>
he,let,the,insult,wash,right,over,him,<END>
he,had,heard,worse,in,his,time,<END>
the,wooden,armor,made,rising,awkward,<END>
he,found,himself,flailing,like,a,turtle,on,its,back,<END>
that,at,least,set,a,few,of,the,sailors,to,laughing,<END>
a,shame,i,did,not,break,my,leg,that,would,have,left,them,howling,<END>
and,if,they,had,been,in,that,privy,when,i,shot,my,father,through,the,bowels,they,might,have,laughed,hard,enough,to,shit,their,breeches,right,along,with,him,<END>
but,anything,to,keep,the,bloody,bastards,sweet,<END>
jorah,mormont,finally,took,pity,on,tyrion's,struggles,and,pulled,him,to,his,feet,<END>
you,looked,a,fool,<END>
that,was,the,intent,<END>
it,is,hard,to,look,a,hero,when,mounted,on,a,pig,<END>
that,must,be,why,i,stay,off,pigs,<END>
tyrion,unbuckled,his,helm,twisted,it,off,and,spat,a,gobbet,of,bloody,pink,phlegm,over,the,side,<END>
it,feels,as,though,i,bit,through,half,my,tongue,<END>
next,time,bite,harder,<END>
ser,jorah,shrugged,<END>
truth,be,told,i've,seen,worse,jousters,<END>
was,that,praise,<END>
i,fell,off,the,bloody,pig,and,bit,my,tongue,<END>
what,could,possibly,be,worse,than,that,<END>
getting,a,splinter,through,your,eye,and,dying,<END>
penny,had,vaulted,off,her,dog,a,big,grey,brute,called,crunch,<END>
the,thing,is,not,to,joust,well,hugor,<END>
she,was,always,careful,to,call,him,hugor,where,anyone,might,hear,<END>
the,thing,is,to,make,them,laugh,and,throw,coins,<END>
poor,payment,for,the,blood,and,bruises,tyrion,thought,but,he,kept,that,to,himself,as,well,<END>
we,failed,at,that,as,well,<END>
no,one,threw,coins,<END>
not,a,penny,not,a,groat,<END>
they,will,when,we,get,better,<END>
penny,pulled,off,her,helm,<END>
mouse-brown,hair,spilled,down,to,her,ears,<END>
her,eyes,were,brown,too,beneath,a,heavy,shelf,of,brow,her,cheeks,smooth,and,flushed,<END>
she,pulled,some,acorns,from,a,leather,bag,for,pretty,pig,<END>
the,sow,ate,them,from,her,hand,squealing,happily,<END>
when,we,perform,for,queen,daenerys,the,silver,will,rain,down,you'll,see,<END>
some,of,the,sailors,were,shouting,at,them,and,slamming,their,heels,against,the,deck,demanding,another,tilt,<END>
the,ship's,cook,was,the,loudest,as,always,<END>
tyrion,had,learned,to,despise,that,man,even,if,he,was,the,only,half-decent,cyvasse,player,on,the,cog,<END>
you,see,they,liked,us,penny,said,with,a,hopeful,little,smile,<END>
shall,we,go,again,hugor,<END>
he,was,on,the,point,of,refusing,when,a,shout,from,one,of,the,mates,spared,him,the,necessity,<END>
it,was,midmorning,and,the,captain,wanted,the,boats,out,again,<END>
the,cog's,huge,striped,sail,hung,limply,from,her,mast,as,it,had,for,days,but,he,was,hopeful,that,they,could,find,a,wind,somewhere,to,the,north,<END>
that,meant,rowing,<END>
the,boats,were,small,however,and,the,cog,was,large,towing,it,was,hot,sweaty,exhausting,work,that,left,the,hands,blistered,and,the,back,aching,and,accomplished,nothing,<END>
the,crew,hated,it,<END>
tyrion,could,not,blame,them,<END>
the,widow,should,have,put,us,on,a,galley,he,muttered,sourly,<END>
if,someone,could,help,me,out,of,these,bloody,planks,i,would,be,grateful,<END>
i,think,i,may,have,a,splinter,through,my,crotch,<END>
mormont,did,the,duty,albeit,with,poor,grace,<END>
penny,collected,her,dog,and,pig,and,led,them,both,below,<END>
you,might,want,to,tell,your,lady,to,keep,her,door,closed,and,barred,when,she's,inside,ser,jorah,said,as,he,was,undoing,the,buckles,on,the,straps,that,joined,the,wooden,breastplate,to,the,backplate,<END>
i'm,hearing,too,much,talk,about,ribs,and,hams,and,bacon,<END>
that,pig,is,half,her,livelihood,<END>
a,ghiscari,crew,would,eat,the,dog,as,well,<END>
mormont,pulled,the,breastplate,and,backplate,apart,<END>
just,tell,her,<END>
as,you,wish,<END>
his,tunic,was,soaked,with,sweat,and,clinging,to,his,chest,<END>
tyrion,plucked,at,it,wishing,for,a,bit,of,breeze,<END>
the,wooden,armor,was,as,hot,and,heavy,as,it,was,uncomfortable,<END>
half,of,it,looked,to,be,old,paint,layer,on,layer,on,layer,of,it,from,a,hundred,past,repaintings,<END>
at,joffrey's,wedding,feast,he,recalled,one,rider,had,displayed,the,direwolf,of,robb,stark,the,other,the,arms,and,colors,of,stannis,baratheon,<END>
we,will,need,both,animals,if,we're,to,tilt,for,queen,daenerys,he,said,<END>
if,the,sailors,took,it,in,their,heads,to,butcher,pretty,pig,neither,he,nor,penny,could,hope,to,stop,them,but,ser,jorah's,longsword,might,give,them,pause,at,least,<END>
is,that,how,you,hope,to,keep,your,head,imp,<END>
ser,imp,if,you,please,<END>
and,yes,<END>
once,her,grace,knows,my,true,worth,she'll,cherish,me,<END>
i,am,a,lovable,little,fellow,after,all,and,i,know,many,useful,things,about,my,kin,<END>

daenerys,targaryen,is,no,silly,child,to,be,diverted,by,japes,and,tumbles,<END>
she,will,deal,with,you,justly,<END>
oh,i,hope,not,<END>
tyrion,studied,mormont,with,his,mismatched,eyes,<END>
and,how,will,she,welcome,you,this,just,queen,<END>
a,warm,embrace,a,girlish,titter,a,headsman's,axe,<END>
he,grinned,at,the,knight's,obvious,discomfit,<END>
did,you,truly,expect,me,to,believe,you,were,about,the,queen's,business,in,that,whorehouse,<END>
defending,her,from,half,a,world,away,<END>
or,could,it,be,that,you,were,running,that,your,dragon,queen,sent,you,from,her,side,<END>
but,why,would,she,oh,wait,you,were,spying,on,her,<END>
tyrion,made,a,clucking,sound,<END>
you,hope,to,buy,your,way,back,into,her,favor,by,presenting,her,with,me,<END>
an,ill-considered,scheme,i'd,say,<END>
one,might,even,say,an,act,of,drunken,desperation,<END>
perhaps,if,i,were,jaime,but,jaime,killed,her,father,i,only,killed,my,own,<END>
you,think,daenerys,will,execute,me,and,pardon,you,but,the,reverse,is,just,as,likely,<END>
maybe,you,should,hop,up,on,that,pig,ser,jorah,<END>
put,on,a,suit,of,iron,motley,like,florian,the,the,blow,the,big,knight,gave,him,cracked,his,head,around,and,knocked,him,sideways,so,hard,that,his,head,bounced,off,the,deck,<END>
blood,filled,his,mouth,as,he,staggered,back,onto,one,knee,<END>
he,spat,out,a,broken,tooth,<END>
growing,prettier,every,day,but,i,do,believe,i,poked,a,wound,<END>
did,the,dwarf,say,something,to,offend,you,ser,<END>
tyrion,asked,innocently,wiping,bubbles,of,blood,off,his,broken,lip,with,the,back,of,his,hand,<END>
i,am,sick,of,your,mouth,dwarf,said,mormont,<END>
you,still,have,a,few,teeth,left,<END>
if,you,want,to,keep,them,stay,away,from,me,for,the,rest,of,this,voyage,<END>
that,could,be,difficult,<END>
we,share,a,cabin,<END>
you,can,find,somewhere,else,to,sleep,<END>
down,in,the,hold,up,on,deck,it,makes,no,matter,<END>
just,keep,out,of,my,sight,<END>
tyrion,pulled,himself,back,to,his,feet,<END>
as,you,wish,he,answered,through,a,mouthful,of,blood,but,the,big,knight,was,already,gone,his,boots,pounding,on,the,deckboards,<END>
below,in,the,galley,tyrion,was,rinsing,out,his,mouth,with,rum,and,water,and,wincing,at,the,sting,when,penny,found,him,<END>
i,heard,what,happened,<END>
oh,are,you,hurt,<END>
he,shrugged,<END>
a,bit,of,blood,and,a,broken,tooth,<END>
but,i,believe,i,hurt,him,more,<END>
and,him,a,knight,<END>
sad,to,say,i,would,not,count,on,ser,jorah,should,we,need,protection,<END>
what,did,you,do,<END>
oh,your,lip,is,bleeding,<END>
she,slipped,a,square,from,her,sleeve,and,dabbed,at,it,<END>
what,did,you,say,<END>
a,few,truths,ser,bezoar,did,not,care,to,hear,<END>
you,mustn't,mock,him,<END>
don't,you,know,anything,<END>
you,can't,talk,that,way,to,a,big,person,<END>

you,have,to,be,careful,around,big,people,<END>
be,jolly,and,playful,with,them,keep,them,smiling,make,them,laugh,that's,what,my,father,always,said,<END>
didn't,your,father,ever,tell,you,how,to,act,with,big,people,<END>
my,father,called,them,smallfolk,said,tyrion,and,he,was,not,what,you'd,call,a,jolly,man,<END>
he,took,another,sip,of,watered,rum,sloshed,it,around,his,mouth,spat,it,out,<END>
still,i,take,your,point,<END>

gladly,<END>
but,what,were,these,truths,<END>
why,did,ser,jorah,hit,you,so,hard,<END>
why,for,love,<END>
the,same,reason,that,i,stewed,that,singer,<END>
he,thought,of,shae,and,the,look,in,her,eyes,as,he,tightened,the,chain,about,her,throat,twisting,it,in,his,fist,<END>

you'll,be,happier,for,it,and,you're,less,like,to,find,yourself,in,some,dingy,brothel,on,the,rhoyne,with,a,whore,who,looks,a,bit,like,your,lost,love,<END>

hands,of,gold,are,always,cold,but,a,woman's,hands,are,warm,<END>
we,should,play,a,game,tyrion,suggested,<END>
that,might,help,take,our,thoughts,off,the,storm,<END>
not,cyvasse,she,said,at,once,<END>
not,cyvasse,tyrion,agreed,as,the,deck,rose,under,him,<END>
that,would,only,lead,to,pieces,flying,violently,across,the,cabin,and,raining,down,on,sow,and,dog,<END>
when,you,were,a,little,girl,did,you,ever,play,come-into-my-castle,<END>

fool,of,a,dwarf,<END>
of,course,she's,never,played,come-intomy-castle,<END>
she,never,had,a,castle,<END>
come-into-my-castle,was,a,game,for,highborn,children,one,meant,to,teach,them,courtesy,heraldry,and,a,thing,or,two,about,their,lord,father's,friends,and,foes,<END>
that,won't,he,started,<END>
the,deck,gave,another,violent,heave,slamming,the,two,of,them,together,<END>

that,game,won't,do,tyrion,told,her,gritting,his,teeth,<END>
sorry,<END>
i,don't,know,what,game,i,do,<END>
penny,kissed,him,<END>
it,was,an,awkward,kiss,rushed,clumsy,<END>
but,it,took,him,utterly,by,surprise,<END>
his,hands,jerked,up,and,grabbed,hold,of,her,shoulders,to,shove,her,away,<END>
instead,he,hesitated,then,pulled,her,closer,gave,her,a,squeeze,<END>
her,lips,were,dry,hard,closed,up,tighter,than,a,miser's,purse,<END>
a,small,mercy,thought,tyrion,<END>
this,was,nothing,he,had,wanted,<END>
he,liked,penny,he,pitied,penny,he,even,admired,penny,in,a,way,but,he,did,not,desire,her,<END>
he,had,no,wish,to,hurt,her,though,the,gods,and,his,sweet,sister,had,given,her,enough,pain,<END>
so,he,let,the,kiss,go,on,holding,her,gently,by,the,shoulders,<END>
his,own,lips,stayed,firmly,shut,<END>
the,selaesori,qhoran,rolled,and,shuddered,around,them,<END>
finally,she,pulled,back,an,inch,or,two,<END>
tyrion,could,see,his,own,reflection,shining,in,her,eyes,<END>
pretty,eyes,he,thought,but,he,saw,other,things,as,well,<END>
a,lot,of,fear,a,little,hope,but,not,a,bit,of,lust,<END>
she,does,not,want,me,no,more,than,i,want,her,<END>

we,cannot,play,that,game,my,lady,<END>
above,the,thunder,boomed,close,at,hand,now,<END>
i,never,meant,i,never,kissed,a,boy,before,but,i,only,thought,what,if,we,drown,and,i,i,it,was,sweet,lied,tyrion,but,i,am,married,<END>
she,was,with,me,at,the,feast,you,may,remember,her,<END>
lady,sansa,<END>
was,she,your,wife,<END>
she,she,was,very,beautiful,and,false,<END>
sansa,shae,all,my,women,tysha,was,the,only,one,who,ever,loved,me,<END>
where,do,whores,go,<END>
a,lovely,girl,said,tyrion,and,we,were,joined,beneath,the,eyes,of,gods,and,men,<END>
it,may,be,that,she,is,lost,to,me,but,until,i,know,that,for,a,certainty,i,must,be,true,to,her,<END>
i,understand,<END>
penny,turned,her,face,away,from,his,<END>
my,perfect,woman,tyrion,thought,bitterly,<END>
one,still,young,enough,to,believe,such,blatant,lies,<END>
the,hull,was,creaking,the,deck,moving,and,pretty,was,squealing,in,distress,<END>
penny,crawled,across,the,cabin,floor,on,her,hands,and,knees,wrapped,her,arms,around,the,sow's,head,and,murmured,reassurance,to,her,<END>
looking,at,the,two,of,them,it,was,hard,to,know,who,was,comforting,whom,<END>
the,sight,was,so,grotesque,it,should,have,been,hilarious,but,tyrion,could,not,even,find,a,smile,<END>
the,girl,deserves,better,than,a,pig,he,thought,<END>
an,honest,kiss,a,little,kindness,everyone,deserves,that,much,however,big,or,small,<END>
he,looked,about,for,his,wine,cup,but,when,he,found,it,all,the,rum,had,spilled,<END>
drowning,is,bad,enough,he,reflected,sourly,but,drowning,sad,and,sober,that's,too,cruel,<END>
in,the,end,they,did,not,drown,though,there,were,times,when,the,prospect,of,a,nice,peaceful,drowning,had,a,certain,appeal,<END>
the,storm,raged,for,the,rest,of,that,day,and,well,into,the,night,<END>
wet,winds,howled,around,them,and,waves,rose,like,the,fists,of,drowned,giants,to,smash,down,on,their,decks,<END>
above,they,learned,later,a,mate,and,two,sailors,were,swept,overboard,the,ship's,cook,was,blinded,when,a,kettle,of,hot,grease,flew,up,into,his,face,and,the,captain,was,thrown,from,the,sterncastle,to,the,main,deck,so,violently,he,broke,both,legs,<END>
below,crunch,howled,and,barked,and,snapped,at,penny,and,pretty,pig,began,to,shit,again,turning,the,cramped,damp,cabin,into,a,sty,<END>
tyrion,managed,to,avoid,retching,his,way,through,all,of,this,chiefly,thanks,to,the,lack,of,wine,<END>
penny,was,not,so,fortunate,but,he,held,her,anyway,as,the,ship's,hull,creaked,and,groaned,alarmingly,around,them,like,a,cask,about,to,burst,<END>
nearby,midnight,the,winds,finally,died,away,and,the,sea,grew,calm,enough,for,tyrion,to,make,his,way,back,up,onto,deck,<END>
what,he,saw,there,did,not,reassure,him,<END>
the,cog,was,drifting,on,a,sea,of,dragonglass,beneath,a,bowl,of,stars,but,all,around,the,storm,raged,on,<END>
east,west,north,south,everywhere,he,looked,the,clouds,rose,up,like,black,mountains,their,tumbled,slopes,and,collossal,cliffs,alive,with,blue,and,purple,lightning,<END>
no,rain,was,falling,but,the,decks,were,slick,and,wet,underfoot,<END>
tyrion,could,hear,someone,screaming,from,below,a,thin,high,voice,hysterical,with,fear,<END>
he,could,hear,moqorro,too,<END>
the,red,priest,stood,on,the,forecastle,facing,the,storm,his,staff,raised,above,his,head,as,he,boomed,a,prayer,<END>
amidships,a,dozen,sailors,and,two,of,the,fiery,fingers,were,struggling,with,tangled,lines,and,sodden,canvas,but,whether,they,were,trying,to,raise,the,sail,again,or,pull,it,down,he,never,knew,<END>
whatever,they,were,doing,it,seemed,to,him,a,very,bad,idea,<END>
and,so,it,was,<END>
the,wind,returned,as,a,whispered,threat,cold,and,damp,brushing,over,his,cheek,flapping,the,wet,sail,swirling,and,tugging,at,moqorro's,scarlet,robes,<END>
some,instinct,made,tyrion,grab,hold,of,the,nearest,rail,just,in,time,<END>
in,the,space,of,three,heartbeats,the,little,breeze,became,a,howling,gale,<END>
moqorro,shouted,something,and,green,flames,leapt,from,the,dragon's,maw,atop,his,staff,to,vanish,in,the,night,<END>
then,the,rains,came,black,and,blinding,and,forecastle,and,sterncastle,both,vanished,behind,a,wall,of,water,<END>
something,huge,flapped,overhead,and,tyrion,glanced,up,in,time,to,see,the,sail,taking,wing,with,two,men,still,dangling,from,the,lines,<END>
then,he,heard,a,crack,<END>
oh,bloody,hell,he,had,time,to,think,that,had,to,be,the,mast,<END>
he,found,a,line,and,pulled,on,it,fighting,toward,the,hatch,to,get,himself,below,out,of,the,storm,but,a,gust,of,wind,knocked,his,feet,from,under,him,and,a,second,slammed,him,into,the,rail,and,there,he,clung,<END>
rain,lashed,at,his,face,blinding,him,<END>
his,mouth,was,full,of,blood,again,<END>
the,ship,groaned,and,growled,beneath,him,like,a,constipated,fat,man,straining,to,shit,<END>
then,the,mast,burst,<END>
tyrion,never,saw,it,but,he,heard,it,<END>
that,cracking,sound,again,and,then,a,scream,of,tortured,wood,and,suddenly,the,air,was,full,of,shards,and,splinters,<END>
one,missed,his,eye,by,half,an,inch,a,second,found,his,neck,a,third,went,through,his,calf,boots,and,breeches,and,all,<END>
he,screamed,<END>
but,he,held,on,to,the,line,held,on,with,a,desperate,strength,he,did,not,know,he,had,<END>
the,widow,said,this,ship,would,never,reach,her,destination,he,remembered,<END>
then,he,laughed,and,laughed,wild,and,hysterical,as,thunder,boomed,and,timbers,moaned,and,waves,crashed,all,around,him,<END>
by,the,time,the,storm,abated,and,the,surviving,passengers,and,crew,came,crawling,back,on,deck,like,pale,pink,worms,wriggling,to,the,surface,after,a,rain,the,selaesori,qhoran,was,a,broken,thing,floating,low,in,the,water,and,listing,ten,degrees,to,port,her,hull,sprung,in,half,a,hundred,places,her,hold,awash,in,seawater,her,mast,a,splintered,ruin,no,taller,than,a,dwarf,<END>
even,her,figurehead,had,not,escaped,one,of,his,arms,had,broken,off,the,one,with,all,his,scrolls,<END>
nine,men,had,been,lost,including,a,mate,two,of,the,fiery,fingers,and,moqorro,himself,<END>
did,benerro,see,this,in,his,fires,<END>
tyrion,wondered,when,he,realized,the,huge,red,priest,was,gone,<END>
did,moqorro,<END>
prophecy,is,like,a,half-trained,mule,he,complained,to,jorah,mormont,<END>
it,looks,as,though,it,might,be,useful,but,the,moment,you,trust,in,it,it,kicks,you,in,the,head,<END>
that,bloody,widow,knew,the,ship,would,never,reach,her,destination,she,warned,us,of,that,said,benerro,saw,it,in,his,fires,only,i,took,that,to,mean,well,what,does,it,matter,<END>
his,mouth,twisted,<END>
what,it,really,meant,was,that,some,bloody,big,storm,would,turn,our,mast,to,kindling,so,we,could,drift,aimlessly,across,the,gulf,of,grief,until,our,food,ran,out,and,we,started,eating,one,another,<END>
who,do,you,suppose,they'll,carve,up,first,the,pig,the,dog,or,me,<END>
the,noisiest,i'd,say,<END>
the,captain,died,the,following,day,the,ship's,cook,three,nights,later,<END>
it,was,all,that,the,remaining,crew,could,do,to,keep,the,wreck,afloat,<END>
the,mate,who,had,assumed,command,reckoned,that,they,were,somewhere,off,the,southern,end,of,the,isle,of,cedars,<END>
when,he,lowered,the,ship's,boats,to,tow,them,toward,the,nearest,land,one,sank,and,the,men,in,the,other,cut,the,line,and,rowed,off,north,abandoning,the,cog,and,all,their,shipmates,<END>
slaves,said,jorah,mormont,contemptuous,<END>
the,big,knight,had,slept,through,the,storm,to,hear,him,tell,it,<END>
tyrion,had,his,doubts,but,he,kept,them,to,himself,<END>
one,day,he,might,want,to,bite,someone,in,the,leg,and,for,that,you,needed,teeth,<END>
mormont,seemed,content,to,ignore,their,disagreement,so,tyrion,decided,to,pretend,it,had,not,happened,<END>
for,nineteen,days,they,drifted,as,food,and,water,dwindled,<END>
the,sun,beat,down,on,them,relentless,<END>
penny,huddled,in,her,cabin,with,her,dog,and,her,pig,and,tyrion,brought,her,food,limping,on,his,bandaged,calf,and,sniffing,at,the,wound,by,night,<END>
when,he,had,nothing,else,to,do,he,pricked,his,toes,and,fingers,too,<END>
ser,jorah,made,a,point,of,sharpening,his,sword,each,day,honing,the,point,until,it,gleamed,<END>
the,three,remaining,fiery,fingers,lit,the,nightfire,as,the,sun,went,down,but,they,wore,their,ornate,armor,as,they,led,the,crew,in,prayer,and,their,spears,were,close,at,hand,<END>
and,not,a,single,sailor,tried,to,rub,the,head,of,either,dwarf,<END>
should,we,joust,for,them,again,<END>
penny,asked,one,night,<END>
best,not,said,tyrion,<END>
that,would,only,serve,to,remind,them,we,have,a,nice,plump,pig,<END>
though,pretty,was,growing,less,plump,with,every,passing,day,and,crunch,was,fur,and,bones,<END>
that,night,he,dreamed,that,he,was,back,in,king's,landing,again,a,crossbow,in,his,hand,<END>
wherever,whores,go,lord,tywin,said,but,when,tyrion's,finger,clenched,and,the,bowstring,thrummed,it,was,penny,with,the,quarrel,buried,in,her,belly,<END>
he,woke,to,the,sound,of,shouting,<END>
the,deck,was,moving,under,him,and,for,half,a,heartbeat,he,was,so,confused,he,thought,he,was,back,on,the,shy,maid,<END>
a,whiff,of,pigshit,brought,him,to,his,senses,<END>
the,sorrows,were,behind,him,half,a,world,away,and,the,joys,of,that,time,as,well,<END>
he,remembered,how,sweet,lemore,had,looked,after,her,morning,swims,with,beads,of,water,glistening,on,her,naked,skin,but,the,only,maiden,here,was,his,poor,penny,the,stunted,little,dwarf,girl,<END>
something,was,afoot,though,<END>
tyrion,slipped,from,the,hammock,yawning,and,looked,about,for,his,boots,<END>
and,mad,though,it,was,he,looked,for,the,crossbow,as,well,but,of,course,there,was,none,such,to,be,found,<END>
a,pity,he,mused,it,might,have,been,some,use,when,the,big,folk,come,to,eat,me,<END>
he,pulled,his,boots,on,and,climbed,on,deck,to,see,what,the,shouting,was,about,<END>
penny,was,there,before,him,her,eyes,wide,with,wonder,<END>
a,sail,she,shouted,there,there,do,you,see,<END>
a,sail,and,they've,seen,us,they,have,<END>
a,sail,<END>
this,time,he,kissed,her,once,on,each,cheek,once,on,the,brow,and,one,last,one,on,the,mouth,<END>
she,was,flushed,and,laughing,by,the,last,kiss,suddenly,shy,again,but,it,made,no,matter,<END>
the,other,ship,was,closing,<END>
a,big,galley,he,saw,<END>
her,oars,left,a,long,white,wake,behind,her,<END>

even,if,he,found,some,secret,way,out,theon,would,not,have,trusted,it,<END>
he,had,not,forgotten,kyra,and,her,keys,<END>
and,if,he,did,get,out,where,would,he,go,<END>
his,father,was,dead,and,his,uncles,had,no,use,for,him,<END>
pyke,was,lost,to,him,<END>
the,nearest,thing,to,a,home,that,remained,to,him,was,here,amongst,the,bones,of,winterfell,<END>
a,ruined,man,a,ruined,castle,<END>
this,is,my,place,<END>
he,was,still,waiting,for,his,porridge,when,ramsay,swept,into,the,hall,with,his,bastard's,boys,shouting,for,music,<END>
abel,rubbed,the,sleep,from,his,eyes,took,up,his,lute,and,launched,into,the,dornishman's,wife,whilst,one,of,his,washerwomen,beat,time,on,her,drum,<END>
the,singer,changed,the,words,though,<END>
instead,of,tasting,a,dornishman's,wife,he,sang,of,tasting,a,northman's,daughter,<END>
he,could,lose,his,tongue,for,that,theon,thought,as,his,bowl,was,being,filled,<END>
he,is,only,a,singer,<END>
lord,ramsay,could,flay,the,skin,off,both,his,hands,and,no,one,would,say,a,word,<END>
but,lord,bolton,smiled,at,the,lyric,and,ramsay,laughed,aloud,<END>
then,others,knew,that,it,was,safe,to,laugh,as,well,<END>
yellow,dick,found,the,song,so,funny,that,wine,snorted,out,his,nose,<END>
lady,arya,was,not,there,to,share,the,merriment,<END>
she,had,not,been,seen,outside,her,chambers,since,her,wedding,night,<END>
sour,alyn,had,been,saying,that,ramsay,kept,his,bride,naked,and,chained,to,a,bedpost,but,theon,knew,that,was,only,talk,<END>
there,were,no,chains,at,least,none,that,men,could,see,<END>
just,a,pair,of,guards,outside,the,bedchamber,to,keep,the,girl,from,wandering,<END>
and,she,is,only,naked,when,she,bathes,<END>
that,she,did,most,every,night,though,<END>
lord,ramsay,wanted,his,wife,clean,<END>
she,has,no,handmaids,poor,thing,he,had,said,to,theon,<END>
that,leaves,you,reek,<END>
should,i,put,you,in,a,dress,<END>
he,laughed,<END>
perhaps,if,you,beg,it,of,me,<END>
just,now,it,will,suffice,for,you,to,be,her,bath,maid,<END>
i,won't,have,her,smelling,like,you,<END>
so,whenever,ramsay,had,an,itch,to,bed,his,wife,it,fell,to,theon,to,borrow,some,servingwomen,from,lady,walda,or,lady,dustin,and,fetch,hot,water,from,the,kitchens,<END>
though,arya,never,spoke,to,any,of,them,they,could,not,fail,to,see,her,bruises,<END>
it,is,her,own,fault,<END>
she,has,not,pleased,him,<END>
just,be,arya,he,told,the,girl,once,as,he,helped,her,into,the,water,<END>
lord,ramsay,does,not,want,to,hurt,you,<END>
he,only,hurts,us,when,we,when,we,forget,<END>
he,never,cut,me,without,cause,<END>
theon,she,whispered,weeping,<END>
reek,<END>
he,grabbed,her,arm,and,shook,her,<END>
in,here,i'm,reek,<END>
you,have,to,remember,arya,<END>
but,the,girl,was,no,true,stark,only,a,steward's,whelp,<END>
jeyne,her,name,is,jeyne,<END>
she,should,not,look,to,me,for,rescue,<END>
theon,greyjoy,might,have,tried,to,help,her,once,<END>
but,theon,had,been,ironborn,and,a,braver,man,than,reek,<END>
reek,reek,it,rhymes,with,weak,<END>
ramsay,had,a,new,plaything,to,amuse,him,one,with,teats,and,a,cunny,but,soon,jeyne's,tears,would,lose,their,savor,and,ramsay,would,want,his,reek,again,<END>
he,will,flay,me,inch,by,inch,<END>
when,my,fingers,are,gone,he,will,take,my,hands,<END>
after,my,toes,my,feet,<END>
but,only,when,i,beg,for,it,when,the,pain,grows,so,bad,that,i,plead,for,him,to,give,me,some,relief,<END>
there,would,be,no,hot,baths,for,reek,<END>
he,would,roll,in,shit,again,forbidden,to,wash,the,clothes,he,wore,would,turn,to,rags,foul,and,stinking,and,he,would,be,made,to,wear,them,till,they,rotted,<END>
the,best,he,could,hope,for,was,to,be,returned,to,the,kennels,with,ramsay's,girls,for,company,<END>
kyra,he,remembered,<END>
the,new,bitch,he,calls,kyra,<END>
he,took,his,bowl,to,the,back,of,the,hall,and,found,a,place,on,an,empty,bench,yards,away,from,the,nearest,torch,<END>
day,or,night,the,benches,below,the,salt,were,never,less,than,half-full,with,men,drinking,dicing,talking,or,sleeping,in,their,clothes,in,quiet,corners,<END>
their,serjeants,would,kick,them,awake,when,it,came,their,turn,to,shrug,back,into,their,cloaks,and,walk,the,walls,<END>
but,no,man,of,them,would,welcome,the,company,of,theon,turncloak,nor,did,he,have,much,taste,for,theirs,<END>
the,gruel,was,grey,and,watery,and,he,pushed,it,away,after,his,third,spoonful,and,let,it,congeal,in,the,bowl,<END>
at,the,next,table,men,were,arguing,about,the,storm,and,wondering,aloud,how,long,the,snow,would,fall,<END>
all,day,and,all,night,might,be,even,longer,insisted,one,big,black-bearded,archer,with,a,cerwyn,axe,sewn,on,his,breast,<END>
a,few,of,the,older,men,spoke,of,other,snowstorms,and,insisted,this,was,no,more,than,a,light,dusting,compared,to,what,they'd,seen,in,the,winters,of,their,youth,<END>
the,riverlanders,were,aghast,<END>
they,have,no,love,of,snow,and,cold,these,southron,swords,<END>
men,entering,the,hall,huddled,by,the,fires,or,clapped,their,hands,together,over,glowing,braziers,as,their,cloaks,hung,dripping,from,pegs,inside,the,door,<END>
the,air,was,thick,and,smoky,and,a,crust,had,formed,atop,his,porridge,when,a,woman's,voice,behind,him,said,theon,greyjoy,<END>
my,name,is,reek,he,almost,said,<END>
what,do,you,want,<END>
she,sat,down,next,to,him,straddling,the,bench,and,pushed,a,wild,mop,of,red-brown,hair,out,of,her,eyes,<END>
why,do,you,eat,alone,m'lord,<END>
come,rise,join,the,dance,<END>
he,went,back,to,his,porridge,<END>
i,don't,dance,<END>
the,prince,of,winterfell,had,been,a,graceful,dancer,but,reek,with,his,missing,toes,would,be,grotesque,<END>
leave,me,be,<END>
i,have,no,coin,<END>
the,woman,smiled,crookedly,<END>
do,you,take,me,for,a,whore,<END>
she,was,one,of,the,singer's,washerwomen,the,tall,skinny,one,too,lean,and,leathery,to,be,called,pretty,though,there,was,a,time,when,theon,would,have,tumbled,her,all,the,same,to,see,how,it,felt,to,have,those,long,legs,wrapped,around,him,<END>
what,good,would,coin,do,me,here,<END>
what,would,i,buy,with,it,some,snow,<END>
she,laughed,<END>
you,could,pay,me,with,a,smile,<END>
i've,never,seen,you,smile,not,even,during,your,sister's,wedding,feast,<END>
lady,arya,is,not,my,sister,<END>
i,do,not,smile,either,he,might,have,told,her,<END>
ramsay,hated,my,smiles,so,he,took,a,hammer,to,my,teeth,<END>
i,can,hardly,eat,<END>
she,never,was,my,sister,<END>
a,pretty,maid,though,<END>
i,was,never,beautiful,like,sansa,but,they,all,said,i,was,pretty,<END>
jeyne's,words,seemed,to,echo,in,his,head,to,the,beat,of,the,drums,two,of,abel's,other,girls,were,pounding,<END>
another,one,had,pulled,little,walder,frey,up,onto,the,table,to,teach,him,how,to,dance,<END>
all,the,men,were,laughing,<END>
leave,me,be,said,theon,<END>

all,the,men,like,holly,<END>
they're,not,my,sisters,neither,but,they're,sweet,<END>
the,woman,leaned,close,<END>
her,breath,smelled,of,wine,<END>
if,you,have,no,smile,for,me,tell,me,how,you,captured,winterfell,<END>
abel,will,put,it,in,a,song,and,you,will,live,forever,<END>
as,a,betrayer,<END>
as,theon,turncloak,<END>
why,not,theon,the,clever,<END>
it,was,a,daring,feat,the,way,we,heard,it,<END>
how,many,men,did,you,have,<END>
a,hundred,<END>
fifty,<END>
fewer,<END>
it,was,madness,<END>
glorious,madness,<END>
stannis,has,five,thousand,they,say,but,abel,claims,ten,times,as,many,still,could,not,breach,these,walls,<END>
so,how,did,you,get,in,m'lord,<END>
did,you,have,some,secret,way,<END>
i,had,ropes,theon,thought,<END>
i,had,grapnels,<END>
i,had,darkness,on,my,side,and,surprise,<END>
the,castle,was,but,lightly,held,and,i,took,them,unawares,<END>
but,he,said,none,of,that,<END>
if,abel,made,a,song,about,him,like,as,not,ramsay,would,prick,his,eardrums,to,make,certain,that,he,never,heard,it,<END>
you,can,trust,me,m'lord,<END>
abel,does,<END>
the,washerwoman,put,her,hand,upon,his,own,<END>
his,hands,were,gloved,in,wool,and,leather,<END>
hers,were,bare,long-fingered,rough,with,nails,chewed,to,the,quick,<END>
you,never,asked,my,name,<END>
it's,rowan,<END>
theon,wrenched,away,<END>
this,was,a,ploy,he,knew,it,<END>
ramsay,sent,her,<END>
she's,another,of,his,japes,like,kyra,with,the,keys,<END>
a,jolly,jape,that's,all,<END>
he,wants,me,to,run,so,he,can,punish,me,<END>
he,wanted,to,hit,her,to,smash,that,mocking,smile,off,her,face,<END>
he,wanted,to,kiss,her,to,fuck,her,right,there,on,the,table,and,make,her,cry,his,name,<END>
but,he,knew,he,dare,not,touch,her,in,anger,or,in,lust,<END>
reek,reek,my,name,is,reek,<END>
i,must,not,forget,my,name,<END>
he,jerked,to,his,feet,and,made,his,way,wordlessly,to,the,doors,limping,on,his,maimed,feet,<END>
outside,the,snow,was,falling,still,<END>
wet,heavy,silent,it,had,already,begun,to,cover,the,footsteps,left,by,the,men,coming,and,going,from,the,hall,<END>
the,drifts,came,almost,to,the,top,of,his,boots,<END>
it,will,be,deeper,in,the,wolfswood,and,out,on,the,kingsroad,where,the,wind,is,blowing,there,will,be,no,escape,from,it,<END>
a,battle,was,being,fought,in,the,yard,ryswells,pelting,barrowton,boys,with,snowballs,<END>
above,he,could,see,some,squires,building,snowmen,along,the,battlements,<END>
they,were,arming,them,with,spears,and,shields,putting,iron,halfhelms,on,their,heads,and,arraying,them,along,the,inner,wall,a,rank,of,snowy,sentinels,<END>
lord,winter,has,joined,us,with,his,levies,one,of,the,sentries,outside,the,great,hall,japed,until,he,saw,theon's,face,and,realized,who,he,was,talking,to,<END>
then,he,turned,his,head,and,spat,<END>
beyond,the,tents,the,big,destriers,of,the,knights,from,white,harbor,and,the,twins,were,shivering,in,their,horse,lines,<END>
ramsay,had,burned,the,stables,when,he,sacked,winterfell,so,his,father,had,thrown,up,new,ones,twice,as,large,as,the,old,to,accommodate,the,warhorses,and,palfreys,of,his,lords',bannermen,and,knights,<END>
the,rest,of,the,horses,were,tethered,in,the,wards,<END>
hooded,grooms,moved,amongst,them,covering,them,with,blankets,to,keep,them,warm,<END>
theon,made,his,way,deeper,into,the,ruined,parts,of,the,castle,<END>
as,he,picked,through,the,shattered,stone,that,had,once,been,maester,luwin's,turret,ravens,looked,down,from,the,gash,in,the,wall,above,muttering,to,one,another,<END>
from,time,to,time,one,would,let,out,a,raucous,scream,<END>
he,stood,in,the,doorway,of,a,bedchamber,that,had,once,been,his,own,ankle,deep,in,snow,that,had,blown,in,through,a,shattered,window,visited,the,ruins,of,mikken's,forge,and,lady,catelyn's,sept,beneath,the,burned,tower,he,passed,rickard,ryswell,nuzzling,at,the,neck,of,another,one,of,abel's,washerwomen,the,plump,one,with,the,apple,cheeks,and,pug,nose,<END>
the,girl,was,barefoot,in,the,snow,bundled,up,in,a,fur,cloak,<END>
he,thought,she,might,be,naked,underneath,<END>
when,she,saw,him,she,said,something,to,ryswell,that,made,him,laugh,aloud,<END>
theon,trudged,away,from,them,<END>
there,was,a,stair,beyond,the,mews,seldom,used,it,was,there,his,feet,took,him,<END>
the,steps,were,steep,and,treacherous,<END>
he,climbed,carefully,and,found,himself,alone,on,the,battlements,of,the,inner,wall,well,away,from,the,squires,and,their,snowmen,<END>
no,one,had,given,him,freedom,of,the,castle,but,no,one,had,denied,it,to,him,either,<END>
he,could,go,where,he,would,within,the,walls,<END>
winterfell's,inner,wall,was,the,older,and,taller,of,the,two,its,ancient,grey,crenellations,rising,one,hundred,feet,high,with,square,towers,at,every,corner,<END>
the,outer,wall,raised,many,centuries,later,was,twenty,feet,lower,but,thicker,and,in,better,repair,boasting,octagonal,towers,in,place,of,square,ones,<END>
between,the,two,walls,was,the,moat,deep,and,wide,and,frozen,<END>
drifts,of,snow,had,begun,to,creep,across,its,icy,surface,<END>
snow,was,building,up,along,the,battlements,too,filling,the,gaps,between,the,merlons,and,putting,pale,soft,caps,on,every,tower,top,<END>
beyond,the,walls,as,far,as,he,could,see,the,world,was,turning,white,<END>
the,woods,the,fields,the,kingsroad,the,snows,were,covering,all,of,them,beneath,a,pale,soft,mantle,burying,the,remnants,of,the,winter,town,hiding,the,blackened,walls,ramsay's,men,had,left,behind,when,they,put,the,houses,to,the,torch,<END>
the,wounds,snow,made,snow,conceals,but,that,was,wrong,<END>
ramsay,was,a,bolton,now,not,a,snow,never,a,snow,<END>
farther,off,the,rutted,kingsroad,had,vanished,lost,amidst,the,fields,and,rolling,hills,all,one,vast,expanse,of,white,<END>
and,still,the,snow,was,falling,drifting,down,in,silence,from,a,windless,sky,<END>
stannis,baratheon,is,out,there,somewhere,freezing,<END>
would,lord,stannis,try,to,take,winterfell,by,storm,<END>
if,he,does,his,cause,is,doomed,<END>
the,castle,was,too,strong,<END>
even,with,the,moat,frozen,over,winterfell's,defenses,remained,formidable,<END>
theon,had,captured,the,castle,by,stealth,sending,his,best,men,to,scale,the,walls,and,swim,the,moat,under,the,cover,of,darkness,<END>
the,defenders,had,not,even,known,they,were,under,attack,until,it,was,too,late,<END>
no,such,subterfuge,was,possible,for,stannis,<END>
he,might,prefer,to,cut,the,castle,off,from,the,outside,world,and,starve,out,its,defenders,<END>
winterfell's,storerooms,and,cellar,vaults,were,empty,<END>
a,long,supply,train,had,come,with,bolton,and,his,friends,of,frey,up,through,the,neck,lady,dustin,had,brought,food,and,fodder,from,barrowton,and,lord,manderly,had,arrived,well,provisioned,from,white,harbor,but,the,host,was,large,<END>
with,so,many,mouths,to,feed,their,stores,could,not,last,for,long,<END>
lord,stannis,and,his,men,will,be,just,as,hungry,though,<END>
and,cold,and,footsore,as,well,in,no,condition,for,a,fight,but,the,storm,will,make,them,desperate,to,get,inside,the,castle,<END>
snow,was,falling,on,the,godswood,too,melting,when,it,touched,the,ground,<END>
beneath,the,white-cloaked,trees,the,earth,had,turned,to,mud,<END>
tendrils,of,mist,hung,in,the,air,like,ghostly,ribbons,<END>
why,did,i,come,here,<END>
these,are,not,my,gods,<END>
this,is,not,my,place,<END>
the,heart,tree,stood,before,him,a,pale,giant,with,a,carved,face,and,leaves,like,bloody,hands,<END>
a,thin,film,of,ice,covered,the,surface,of,the,pool,beneath,the,weirwood,<END>

snow,fell,around,him,pale,and,silent,keeping,its,own,counsel,<END>
the,only,sound,was,a,faint,soft,sobbing,<END>

it,is,her,sobbing,in,her,bridal,bed,<END>
who,else,could,it,be,<END>
gods,do,not,weep,<END>
or,do,they,<END>
the,sound,was,too,painful,to,endure,<END>
theon,grabbed,hold,of,a,branch,and,pulled,himself,back,to,his,feet,knocked,the,snow,off,his,legs,and,limped,back,toward,the,lights,<END>
there,are,ghosts,in,winterfell,he,thought,and,i,am,one,of,them,<END>
more,snowmen,had,risen,in,the,yard,by,the,time,theon,greyjoy,made,his,way,back,<END>
to,command,the,snowy,sentinels,on,the,walls,the,squires,had,erected,a,dozen,snowy,lords,<END>
one,was,plainly,meant,to,be,lord,manderly,it,was,the,fattest,snowman,that,theon,had,ever,seen,<END>

and,the,one,closest,to,the,door,with,the,beard,made,of,icicles,had,to,be,old,whoresbane,umber,<END>
inside,the,cooks,were,ladling,out,beef-and-barley,stew,thick,with,carrots,and,onions,served,in,trenchers,hollowed,from,loaves,of,yesterday's,bread,<END>
scraps,were,thrown,onto,the,floor,to,be,gobbled,up,by,ramsay's,girls,and,the,other,dogs,<END>

red,jeyne,loped,over,to,lick,at,his,hand,and,helicent,slipped,under,the,table,and,curled,up,by,his,feet,gnawing,at,a,bone,<END>
they,were,good,dogs,<END>
it,was,easy,to,forget,that,every,one,was,named,for,a,girl,that,ramsay,had,hunted,and,killed,<END>
weary,as,he,was,theon,had,appetite,enough,to,eat,a,little,stew,washed,down,with,ale,<END>
by,then,the,hall,had,grown,raucous,<END>
two,of,roose,bolton's,scouts,had,come,straggling,back,through,the,hunter's,gate,to,report,that,lord,stannis's,advance,had,slowed,to,a,crawl,<END>
his,knights,rode,destriers,and,the,big,warhorses,were,foundering,in,the,snow,<END>
the,small,sure-footed,garrons,of,the,hill,clans,were,faring,better,the,scouts,said,but,the,clansmen,dared,not,press,too,far,ahead,or,the,whole,host,would,come,apart,<END>
lord,ramsay,commanded,abel,to,give,them,a,marching,song,in,honor,of,stannis,trudging,through,the,snows,so,the,bard,took,up,his,lute,again,whilst,one,of,his,washerwomen,coaxed,a,sword,from,sour,alyn,and,mimed,stannis,slashing,at,the,snowflakes,<END>
theon,was,staring,down,into,the,last,dregs,of,his,third,tankard,when,lady,barbrey,dustin,swept,into,the,hall,and,sent,two,of,her,sworn,swords,to,bring,him,to,her,<END>
when,he,stood,below,the,dais,she,looked,him,up,and,down,and,sniffed,<END>
those,are,the,same,clothes,you,wore,for,the,wedding,<END>
yes,my,lady,<END>
they,are,the,clothes,i,was,given,<END>
that,was,one,of,the,lessons,he,had,learned,at,the,dreadfort,to,take,what,he,was,given,and,never,ask,for,more,<END>

then,all,the,hillmen,were,shouting,banging,their,cups,and,drinking,horns,on,the,table,filling,the,king's,tent,with,the,clangor,<END>
asha,greyjoy,would,have,welcomed,a,fight,herself,<END>

the,next,day,the,king's,scouts,chanced,upon,an,abandoned,crofters',village,between,two,lakes,a,mean,and,meagre,place,no,more,than,a,few,huts,a,longhall,and,a,watchtower,<END>

asha,was,amongst,them,<END>
there,are,fish,in,those,lakes,horpe,told,the,king,<END>
we'll,cut,holes,in,the,ice,<END>

even,in,his,bulky,fur,cloak,and,heavy,armor,stannis,looked,like,a,man,with,one,foot,in,the,grave,<END>
what,little,flesh,he'd,carried,on,his,tall,spare,frame,at,deepwood,motte,had,melted,away,during,the,march,<END>

the,sky,turned,from,black,to,white,and,seemed,no,brighter,<END>
asha,greyjoy,awoke,cramped,and,cold,beneath,the,pile,of,sleeping,furs,listening,to,the,she-bear's,snores,<END>

no,trumpets,blew,to,rouse,the,men,to,mount,up,form,column,prepare,to,march,<END>
no,warhorns,summoned,forth,the,northmen,<END>
something,is,wrong,<END>
asha,crawled,out,from,under,her,sleeping,furs,and,pushed,her,way,out,of,the,tent,knocking,aside,the,wall,of,snow,that,had,sealed,them,in,during,the,night,<END>
her,irons,clanked,as,she,climbed,to,her,feet,and,took,a,breath,of,the,icy,morning,air,<END>
the,snow,was,still,falling,even,more,heavily,than,when,she'd,crawled,inside,the,tent,<END>
the,lakes,had,vanished,and,the,woods,as,well,<END>
she,could,see,the,shapes,of,other,tents,and,lean-tos,and,the,fuzzy,orange,glow,of,the,beacon,fire,burning,atop,the,watchtower,but,not,the,tower,itself,<END>
the,storm,had,swallowed,the,rest,<END>

daenerys,<END>

daario,stroked,his,gilded,mustachio,<END>
would,i,steal,from,my,sweet,queen,<END>
if,it,were,a,gift,worthy,of,you,i,would,have,put,it,into,your,soft,hands,myself,<END>
as,a,token,of,your,love,<END>
as,to,that,i,will,not,say,but,i,told,him,that,he,could,give,it,to,you,<END>
you,would,not,make,a,liar,of,daario,naharis,<END>
dany,was,helpless,to,refuse,<END>
as,you,wish,<END>
bring,your,frog,to,court,tomorrow,<END>
the,others,too,<END>
the,westerosi,<END>
it,would,be,nice,to,hear,the,common,tongue,from,someone,besides,ser,barristan,<END>
as,my,queen,commands,<END>
daario,bowed,deeply,grinned,and,took,his,leave,his,cloak,swirling,behind,him,<END>
dany,sat,amongst,the,rumpled,bedclothes,with,her,arms,about,her,knees,so,forlorn,that,she,did,not,hear,when,missandei,came,creeping,in,with,bread,and,milk,and,figs,<END>
your,grace,<END>
are,you,unwell,<END>
in,the,black,of,night,this,one,heard,you,scream,<END>
dany,took,a,fig,<END>
it,was,black,and,plump,still,moist,with,dew,<END>
will,hizdahr,ever,make,me,scream,<END>
it,was,the,wind,that,you,heard,screaming,<END>
she,took,a,bite,but,the,fruit,had,lost,its,savor,now,that,daario,was,gone,<END>
sighing,she,rose,and,called,to,irri,for,a,robe,then,wandered,out,onto,her,terrace,<END>
her,foes,were,all,about,her,<END>
there,were,never,less,than,a,dozen,ships,drawn,up,on,the,shore,<END>
some,days,there,were,as,many,as,a,hundred,when,the,soldiers,were,disembarking,<END>
the,yunkai'i,were,even,bringing,in,wood,by,sea,<END>
behind,their,ditches,they,were,building,catapults,scorpions,tall,trebuchets,<END>
on,still,nights,she,could,hear,the,hammers,ringing,through,the,warm,dry,air,<END>
no,siege,towers,though,<END>
no,battering,rams,<END>
they,would,not,try,to,take,meereen,by,storm,<END>
they,would,wait,behind,their,siege,lines,flinging,stones,at,her,until,famine,and,disease,had,brought,her,people,to,their,knees,<END>
hizdahr,will,bring,me,peace,<END>
he,must,<END>
that,night,her,cooks,roasted,her,a,kid,with,dates,and,carrots,but,dany,could,only,eat,a,bite,of,it,<END>
the,prospect,of,wrestling,with,meereen,once,more,left,her,feeling,weary,<END>
sleep,came,hard,even,when,daario,came,back,so,drunk,that,he,could,hardly,stand,<END>
beneath,her,coverlets,she,tossed,and,turned,dreaming,that,hizdahr,was,kissing,her,but,his,lips,were,blue,and,bruised,and,when,he,thrust,himself,inside,her,his,manhood,was,cold,as,ice,<END>
she,sat,up,with,her,hair,disheveled,and,the,bedclothes,atangle,<END>
her,captain,slept,beside,her,yet,she,was,alone,<END>
she,wanted,to,shake,him,wake,him,make,him,hold,her,fuck,her,help,her,forget,but,she,knew,that,if,she,did,he,would,only,smile,and,yawn,and,say,it,was,just,a,dream,my,queen,<END>
go,back,to,sleep,<END>
instead,she,slipped,into,a,hooded,robe,and,stepped,out,onto,her,terrace,<END>
she,went,to,the,parapet,and,stood,there,gazing,down,upon,the,city,as,she,had,done,a,hundred,times,before,<END>
it,will,never,be,my,city,<END>
it,will,never,be,my,home,<END>
the,pale,pink,light,of,dawn,found,her,still,out,on,her,terrace,asleep,upon,the,grass,beneath,a,blanket,of,fine,dew,<END>
i,promised,daario,that,i,would,hold,court,today,daenerys,told,her,handmaids,when,they,woke,her,<END>
help,me,find,my,crown,<END>
oh,and,some,clothes,to,wear,something,light,and,cool,<END>
she,made,her,descent,an,hour,later,<END>
all,kneel,for,daenerys,stormborn,the,unburnt,queen,of,meereen,queen,of,the,andals,and,the,rhoynar,and,the,first,men,khaleesi,of,great,grass,sea,breaker,of,shackles,and,mother,of,dragons,missandei,called,<END>
reznak,mo,reznak,bowed,and,beamed,<END>
magnificence,every,day,you,grow,more,beautiful,<END>
i,think,the,prospect,of,your,wedding,has,given,you,a,glow,<END>
oh,my,shining,queen,<END>
dany,sighed,<END>
summon,the,first,petitioner,<END>
it,had,been,so,long,since,she,last,held,court,that,the,crush,of,cases,was,almost,overwhelming,<END>
the,back,of,the,hall,was,a,solid,press,of,people,and,scuffles,broke,out,over,precedence,<END>
inevitably,it,was,galazza,galare,who,stepped,forward,her,head,held,high,her,face,hidden,behind,a,shimmering,green,veil,<END>
your,radiance,it,might,be,best,were,we,to,speak,in,private,<END>
would,that,i,had,the,time,said,dany,sweetly,<END>
i,am,to,be,wed,upon,the,morrow,<END>
her,last,meeting,with,the,green,grace,had,not,gone,well,<END>
what,would,you,have,of,me,<END>
i,would,speak,to,you,about,the,presumption,of,a,certain,sellsword,captain,<END>
she,dares,say,that,in,open,court,<END>
dany,felt,a,blaze,of,anger,<END>
she,has,courage,i,grant,that,but,if,she,thinks,i,am,about,to,suffer,another,scolding,she,could,not,be,more,wrong,<END>
the,treachery,of,brown,ben,plumm,has,shocked,us,all,she,said,but,your,warning,comes,too,late,<END>
and,now,i,know,you,will,want,to,return,to,your,temple,to,pray,for,peace,<END>
the,green,grace,bowed,<END>
i,shall,pray,for,you,as,well,<END>
another,slap,thought,dany,color,rising,to,her,face,<END>
the,rest,was,a,tedium,the,queen,knew,well,<END>
she,sat,upon,her,cushions,listening,one,foot,jiggling,with,impatience,<END>
jhiqui,brought,a,platter,of,figs,and,ham,at,midday,<END>
there,seemed,to,be,no,end,to,the,petitioners,<END>
for,every,two,she,sent,off,smiling,one,left,redeyed,or,muttering,<END>
it,was,close,to,sunset,before,daario,naharis,appeared,with,his,new,stormcrows,the,westerosi,who,had,come,over,to,him,from,the,windblown,<END>
dany,found,herself,glancing,at,them,as,yet,another,petitioner,droned,on,and,on,<END>
these,are,my,people,<END>
i,am,their,rightful,queen,<END>
they,seemed,a,scruffy,bunch,but,that,was,only,to,be,expected,of,sellswords,<END>
the,youngest,could,not,have,been,more,than,a,year,older,than,her,the,oldest,must,have,seen,sixty,namedays,<END>
a,few,sported,signs,of,wealth,gold,arm,rings,silken,tunics,silverstudded,sword,belts,<END>
plunder,<END>
for,the,most,part,their,clothes,were,plainly,made,and,showed,signs,of,hard,wear,<END>
when,daario,brought,them,forward,she,saw,that,one,of,them,was,a,woman,big,and,blond,and,all,in,mail,<END>
pretty,meris,her,captain,named,her,though,pretty,was,the,last,thing,dany,would,have,called,her,<END>
she,was,six,feet,tall,and,earless,with,a,slit,nose,deep,scars,in,both,cheeks,and,the,coldest,eyes,the,queen,had,ever,seen,<END>
as,for,the,rest,hugh,hungerford,was,slim,and,saturnine,long-legged,long-faced,clad,in,faded,finery,<END>
webber,was,short,and,muscular,with,spiders,tattooed,across,his,head,and,chest,and,arms,<END>
red-faced,orson,stone,claimed,to,be,a,knight,as,did,lanky,lucifer,long,<END>
will,of,the,woods,leered,at,her,even,as,he,took,a,knee,<END>
dick,straw,had,cornflower-blue,eyes,hair,as,white,as,flax,and,an,unsettling,smile,<END>
ginger,jack's,face,was,hidden,behind,a,bristly,orange,beard,and,his,speech,was,unintelligible,<END>
he,bit,off,half,his,tongue,in,his,first,battle,hungerford,explained,to,her,<END>
the,dornishmen,seemed,different,<END>
if,it,please,your,grace,said,daario,these,three,are,greenguts,gerrold,and,frog,<END>
greenguts,was,huge,and,bald,as,a,stone,with,arms,thick,enough,to,rival,even,strong,belwas,<END>
gerrold,was,a,lean,tall,youth,with,sun,streaks,in,his,hair,and,laughing,blue-green,eyes,<END>
that,smile,has,won,many,a,maiden's,heart,i'll,wager,<END>
his,cloak,was,made,of,soft,brown,wool,lined,with,sandsilk,a,goodly,garment,<END>
frog,the,squire,was,the,youngest,of,the,three,and,the,least,impressive,a,solemn,stocky,lad,brown,of,hair,and,eye,<END>
his,face,was,squarish,with,a,high,forehead,heavy,jaw,and,broad,nose,<END>
the,stubble,on,his,cheeks,and,chin,made,him,look,like,a,boy,trying,to,grow,his,first,beard,<END>
dany,had,no,inkling,why,anyone,would,call,him,frog,<END>
perhaps,he,can,jump,farther,than,the,others,<END>
you,may,rise,she,said,<END>
daario,tells,me,you,come,to,us,from,dorne,<END>
dornishmen,will,always,have,a,welcome,at,my,court,<END>
sunspear,stayed,loyal,to,my,father,when,the,usurper,stole,his,throne,<END>
you,must,have,faced,many,perils,to,reach,me,<END>
too,many,said,gerrold,the,handsome,one,with,the,sun-streaked,hair,<END>
we,were,six,when,we,left,dorne,your,grace,<END>
i,am,sorry,for,your,losses,<END>
the,queen,turned,to,his,large,companion,<END>
greenguts,is,a,queer,sort,of,name,<END>
a,jape,your,grace,<END>
from,the,ships,<END>
i,was,greensick,the,whole,way,from,volantis,<END>
heaving,and,well,i,shouldn't,say,<END>
dany,giggled,<END>
i,think,that,i,can,guess,ser,<END>
it,is,ser,is,it,not,<END>
daario,tells,me,that,you,are,a,knight,<END>
if,it,please,your,grace,we,are,all,three,knights,<END>
dany,glanced,at,daario,and,saw,anger,flash,across,his,face,<END>
he,did,not,know,<END>
i,have,need,of,knights,she,said,<END>
ser,barristan's,suspicions,had,awakened,<END>
knighthood,is,easily,claimed,this,far,from,westeros,<END>
are,you,prepared,to,defend,that,boast,with,sword,or,lance,<END>
if,need,be,said,gerrold,though,i,will,not,claim,that,any,of,us,is,the,equal,of,barristan,the,bold,<END>
your,grace,i,beg,your,pardon,but,we,have,come,before,you,under,false,names,<END>
i,knew,someone,else,who,did,that,once,said,dany,a,man,called,arstan,whitebeard,<END>
tell,me,your,true,names,then,<END>
gladly,but,if,we,may,beg,the,queen's,indulgence,is,there,some,place,with,fewer,eyes,and,ears,<END>
games,within,games,<END>
as,you,wish,<END>
skahaz,clear,my,court,<END>
the,shavepate,roared,out,orders,<END>
his,brazen,beasts,did,the,rest,herding,the,other,westerosi,and,the,rest,of,the,day's,petitioners,from,the,hall,<END>
her,counselors,remained,<END>
now,dany,said,your,names,<END>
handsome,young,gerrold,bowed,<END>
ser,gerris,drinkwater,your,grace,<END>
my,sword,is,yours,<END>
greenguts,crossed,his,arms,against,his,chest,<END>
and,my,warhammer,<END>
i'm,ser,archibald,yronwood,<END>
and,you,ser,<END>
the,queen,asked,the,boy,called,frog,<END>
if,it,please,your,grace,may,i,first,present,my,gift,<END>
if,you,wish,daenerys,said,curious,but,as,frog,started,forward,daario,naharis,stepped,in,front,of,him,and,held,out,a,gloved,hand,<END>
give,this,gift,to,me,<END>
stone-faced,the,stocky,lad,bent,unlaced,his,boot,and,drew,a,yellowed,parchment,from,a,hidden,flap,within,<END>
this,is,your,gift,<END>
a,scrap,of,writing,<END>
daario,snatched,the,parchment,out,of,the,dornishman's,hands,and,unrolled,it,squinting,at,the,seals,and,signatures,<END>
very,pretty,all,the,gold,and,ribbons,but,i,do,not,read,your,westerosi,scratchings,<END>
bring,it,to,the,queen,ser,barristan,commanded,<END>
now,<END>
dany,could,feel,the,anger,in,the,hall,<END>
i,am,only,a,young,girl,and,young,girls,must,have,their,gifts,she,said,lightly,<END>
daario,please,you,must,not,tease,me,<END>
give,it,here,<END>
the,parchment,was,written,in,the,common,tongue,<END>
the,queen,unrolled,it,slowly,studying,the,seals,and,signatures,<END>
when,she,saw,the,name,ser,willem,darry,her,heart,beat,a,little,faster,<END>
she,read,it,over,once,and,then,again,<END>
may,we,know,what,it,says,your,grace,<END>
asked,ser,barristan,<END>
it,is,a,secret,pact,dany,said,made,in,braavos,when,i,was,just,a,little,girl,<END>
ser,willem,darry,signed,for,us,the,man,who,spirited,my,brother,and,myself,away,from,dragonstone,before,the,usurper's,men,could,take,us,<END>
prince,oberyn,martell,signed,for,dorne,with,the,sealord,of,braavos,as,witness,<END>
she,handed,the,parchment,to,ser,barristan,so,he,might,read,it,for,himself,<END>
the,alliance,is,to,be,sealed,by,a,marriage,it,says,<END>
in,return,for,dorne's,help,overthrowing,the,usurper,my,brother,viserys,is,to,take,prince,doran's,daughter,arianne,for,his,queen,<END>
the,old,knight,read,the,pact,slowly,<END>
if,robert,had,known,of,this,he,would,have,smashed,sunspear,as,he,once,smashed,pyke,and,claimed,the,heads,of,prince,doran,and,the,red,viper,and,like,as,not,the,head,of,this,dornish,princess,too,<END>
no,doubt,that,was,why,prince,doran,chose,to,keep,the,pact,a,secret,suggested,daenerys,<END>
if,my,brother,viserys,had,known,that,he,had,a,dornish,princess,waiting,for,him,he,would,have,crossed,to,sunspear,as,soon,as,he,was,old,enough,to,wed,and,thereby,brought,robert's,warhammer,down,upon,himself,and,dorne,as,well,said,frog,<END>
my,father,was,content,to,wait,for,the,day,that,prince,viserys,found,his,army,<END>
your,father,<END>
prince,doran,<END>
he,sank,back,onto,one,knee,<END>
your,grace,i,have,the,honor,to,be,quentyn,martell,a,prince,of,dorne,and,your,most,leal,subject,<END>
dany,laughed,<END>
the,dornish,prince,flushed,red,whilst,her,own,court,and,counselors,gave,her,puzzled,looks,<END>
radiance,<END>
said,skahaz,shavepate,in,the,ghiscari,tongue,<END>
why,do,you,laugh,<END>
they,call,him,frog,she,said,and,we,have,just,learned,why,<END>
in,the,seven,kingdoms,there,are,children's,tales,of,frogs,who,turn,into,enchanted,princes,when,kissed,by,their,true,love,<END>
smiling,at,the,dornish,knights,she,switched,back,to,the,common,tongue,<END>
tell,me,prince,quentyn,are,you,enchanted,<END>
no,your,grace,<END>
i,feared,as,much,<END>
neither,enchanted,nor,enchanting,alas,<END>
a,pity,he's,the,prince,and,not,the,one,with,the,wide,shoulders,and,the,sandy,hair,<END>
you,have,come,for,a,kiss,however,<END>
you,mean,to,marry,me,<END>
is,that,the,way,of,it,<END>
the,gift,you,bring,me,is,your,own,sweet,self,<END>
instead,of,viserys,and,your,sister,you,and,i,must,seal,this,pact,if,i,want,dorne,<END>
my,father,hoped,that,you,might,find,me,acceptable,<END>
daario,naharis,gave,a,scornful,laugh,<END>
i,say,you,are,a,pup,<END>
the,queen,needs,a,man,beside,her,not,a,mewling,boy,<END>
you,are,no,fit,husband,for,a,woman,such,as,her,<END>
when,you,lick,your,lips,do,you,still,taste,your,mother's,milk,<END>
ser,gerris,drinkwater,darkened,at,his,words,<END>
mind,your,tongue,sellsword,<END>
you,are,speaking,to,a,prince,of,dorne,<END>
and,to,his,wet,nurse,i,am,thinking,<END>
daario,brushed,his,thumbs,across,his,sword,hilts,and,smiled,dangerously,<END>
skahaz,scowled,as,only,he,could,scowl,<END>
this,boy,might,serve,for,dorne,but,meereen,needs,a,king,of,ghiscari,blood,<END>
i,know,of,this,dorne,said,reznak,mo,reznak,<END>
dorne,is,sand,and,scorpions,and,bleak,red,mountains,baking,in,the,sun,<END>
prince,quentyn,answered,him,<END>
dorne,is,fifty,thousand,spears,and,swords,pledged,to,our,queen's,service,<END>
fifty,thousand,<END>
mocked,daario,<END>
i,count,three,<END>
enough,daenerys,said,<END>
prince,quentyn,has,crossed,half,the,world,to,offer,me,his,gift,i,will,not,have,him,treated,with,discourtesy,<END>
she,turned,to,the,dornishmen,<END>
would,that,you,had,come,a,year,ago,<END>
i,am,pledged,to,wed,the,noble,hizdahr,zo,loraq,<END>
ser,gerris,said,it,is,not,too,late,i,will,be,the,judge,of,that,daenerys,said,<END>
reznak,see,that,the,prince,and,his,companions,are,given,quarters,suitable,to,their,high,birth,and,that,their,wants,are,attended,to,<END>
as,you,wish,your,radiance,<END>
the,queen,rose,<END>
then,we,are,done,for,now,<END>
daario,and,ser,barristan,followed,her,up,the,steps,to,her,apartments,<END>
this,changes,everything,the,old,knight,said,<END>
this,changes,nothing,dany,said,as,irri,removed,her,crown,<END>
what,good,are,three,men,<END>
three,knights,said,selmy,<END>
three,liars,daario,said,darkly,<END>
they,deceived,me,<END>
and,bought,you,too,i,do,not,doubt,<END>
he,did,not,trouble,to,deny,it,<END>
dany,unrolled,the,parchment,and,examined,it,again,<END>
braavos,<END>
this,was,done,in,braavos,while,we,were,living,in,the,house,with,the,red,door,<END>
why,did,that,make,her,feel,so,strange,<END>
she,found,herself,remembering,her,nightmare,<END>
sometimes,there,is,truth,in,dreams,<END>
could,hizdahr,zo,loraq,be,working,for,the,warlocks,was,that,what,the,dream,had,meant,<END>
could,the,dream,have,been,a,sending,<END>
were,the,gods,telling,her,to,put,hizdahr,aside,and,wed,this,dornish,prince,instead,<END>
something,tickled,at,her,memory,<END>
ser,barristan,what,are,the,arms,of,house,martell,<END>
a,sun,in,splendor,transfixed,by,a,spear,<END>
the,sun's,son,<END>
a,shiver,went,through,her,<END>
shadows,and,whispers,<END>
what,else,had,quaithe,said,<END>
the,pale,mare,and,the,sun's,son,<END>
there,was,a,lion,in,it,too,and,a,dragon,<END>
or,am,i,the,dragon,<END>
beware,the,perfumed,seneschal,<END>
that,she,remembered,<END>
dreams,and,prophecies,<END>
why,must,they,always,be,in,riddles,<END>
i,hate,this,<END>
oh,leave,me,ser,<END>
tomorrow,is,my,wedding,day,<END>
that,night,daario,had,her,every,way,a,man,can,have,a,woman,and,she,gave,herself,to,him,willingly,<END>
the,last,time,as,the,sun,was,coming,up,she,used,her,mouth,to,make,him,hard,again,as,doreah,had,taught,her,long,ago,then,rode,him,so,wildly,that,his,wound,began,to,bleed,again,and,for,one,sweet,heartbeat,she,could,not,tell,whether,he,was,inside,of,her,or,her,inside,of,him,<END>
but,when,the,sun,rose,upon,her,wedding,day,so,did,daario,naharis,donning,his,clothes,and,buckling,on,his,sword,belt,with,its,gleaming,golden,wantons,<END>
where,are,you,going,<END>
dany,asked,him,<END>
i,forbid,you,to,make,a,sortie,today,<END>
my,queen,is,cruel,her,captain,said,<END>
if,i,cannot,slay,your,foes,how,shall,i,amuse,myself,whilst,you,are,being,wed,<END>
by,nightfall,i,shall,have,no,foes,<END>
it,is,only,dawn,sweet,queen,<END>
the,day,is,long,<END>
time,enough,for,one,last,sortie,<END>
i,will,bring,you,back,the,head,of,brown,ben,plumm,for,a,wedding,gift,<END>
no,heads,dany,insisted,<END>
once,you,brought,me,flowers,<END>
let,hizdahr,bring,you,flowers,<END>
he,is,not,one,to,stoop,and,pluck,a,dandelion,true,but,he,has,servants,who,will,be,pleased,to,do,it,for,him,<END>
do,i,have,your,leave,to,go,<END>
no,<END>
she,wanted,him,to,stay,and,hold,her,<END>
one,day,he,will,go,and,not,return,she,thought,<END>
one,day,some,archer,will,put,an,arrow,through,his,chest,or,ten,men,will,fall,on,him,with,spears,and,swords,and,axes,ten,would-be,heroes,<END>
five,of,them,would,die,but,that,would,not,make,her,grief,easier,to,bear,<END>
one,day,i,will,lose,him,as,i,lost,my,sun-andstars,<END>
but,please,gods,not,today,<END>
come,back,to,bed,and,kiss,me,<END>
no,one,had,ever,kissed,her,like,daario,naharis,<END>
i,am,your,queen,and,i,command,you,to,fuck,me,<END>
she,had,meant,it,playfully,but,daario's,eyes,hardened,at,her,words,<END>

she,won't,be,safe,though,<END>
winterfell,is,burned,and,broken,and,there,are,no,more,safe,places,<END>
he,could,not,keep,her,here,with,him,no,matter,how,much,he,might,want,to,<END>
the,wall,was,no,place,for,a,woman,much,less,a,girl,of,noble,birth,<END>
nor,was,he,about,to,turn,her,over,to,stannis,or,melisandre,<END>
the,king,would,only,want,to,marry,her,to,one,of,his,own,men,horpe,or,massey,or,godry,giantslayer,and,the,gods,alone,knew,what,use,the,red,woman,might,want,to,make,of,her,<END>
the,best,solution,he,could,see,would,mean,dispatching,her,to,eastwatch,and,asking,cotter,pyke,to,put,her,on,a,ship,to,someplace,across,the,sea,beyond,the,reach,of,all,these,quarrelsome,kings,<END>
it,would,need,to,wait,until,the,ships,returned,from,hardhome,to,be,sure,<END>
she,could,return,to,braavos,with,tycho,nestoris,<END>
perhaps,the,iron,bank,could,help,find,some,noble,family,to,foster,her,<END>
braavos,was,the,nearest,of,the,free,cities,though,which,made,it,both,the,best,and,the,worst,choice,<END>
lorath,or,the,port,of,ibben,might,be,safer,<END>
wherever,he,might,send,her,though,arya,would,need,silver,to,support,her,a,roof,above,her,head,someone,to,protect,her,<END>
she,was,only,a,child,<END>
maester,aemon's,old,chambers,were,so,warm,that,the,sudden,cloud,of,steam,when,mully,pulled,the,door,open,was,enough,to,blind,the,both,of,them,<END>

the,girl,was,curled,up,near,the,fire,wrapped,in,a,black,woolen,cloak,three,times,her,size,and,fast,asleep,<END>
she,looked,enough,like,arya,to,give,him,pause,but,only,for,a,moment,<END>
a,tall,skinny,coltish,girl,all,legs,and,elbows,her,brown,hair,was,woven,in,a,thick,braid,and,bound,about,with,strips,of,leather,<END>

hobb's,sausages,were,made,of,grease,and,salt,and,things,that,did,not,bear,thinking,about,<END>

then,it,came,<END>
alys,karstark,<END>
that,brought,the,ghost,of,a,smile,to,her,lips,<END>

i,was,six,the,last,time,you,saw,me,<END>
you,came,to,winterfell,with,your,father,<END>
the,father,robb,beheaded,<END>
i,don't,recall,what,for,<END>
she,blushed,<END>
so,i,could,meet,your,brother,<END>
oh,there,was,some,other,pretext,but,that,was,the,real,reason,<END>
i,was,almost,of,an,age,with,robb,and,my,father,thought,we,might,make,a,match,<END>
there,was,a,feast,<END>
i,danced,with,you,and,your,brother,both,<END>
he,was,very,courteous,and,said,that,i,danced,beautifully,<END>
you,were,sullen,<END>
my,father,said,that,was,to,be,expected,in,a,bastard,<END>
i,remember,<END>
it,was,only,half,a,lie,<END>
you're,still,a,little,sullen,the,girl,said,but,i,will,forgive,you,that,if,you,will,save,me,from,my,uncle,<END>
your,uncle,would,that,be,lord,arnolf,<END>
he,is,no,lord,alys,said,scornfully,<END>
my,brother,harry,is,the,rightful,lord,and,by,law,i,am,his,heir,<END>
a,daughter,comes,before,an,uncle,<END>
uncle,arnolf,is,only,castellan,<END>
he's,my,great-uncle,actually,my,father's,uncle,<END>
cregan,is,his,son,<END>
i,suppose,that,makes,him,a,cousin,but,we,always,called,him,uncle,<END>
now,they,mean,to,make,me,call,him,husband,<END>
she,made,a,fist,<END>
before,the,war,i,was,betrothed,to,daryn,hornwood,<END>
we,were,only,waiting,till,i,flowered,to,be,wed,but,the,kingslayer,killed,daryn,in,the,whispering,wood,<END>
my,father,wrote,that,he,would,find,some,southron,lord,to,wed,me,but,he,never,did,<END>
your,brother,robb,cut,off,his,head,for,killing,lannisters,<END>
her,mouth,twisted,<END>
i,thought,the,whole,reason,they,marched,south,was,to,kill,some,lannisters,<END>
it,was,not,so,simple,as,that,<END>
lord,karstark,slew,two,prisoners,my,lady,<END>
unarmed,boys,squires,in,a,cell,<END>
the,girl,did,not,seem,surprised,<END>
my,father,never,bellowed,like,the,greatjon,but,he,was,no,less,dangerous,in,his,wroth,<END>

i,did,not,know,where,else,to,turn,but,to,the,last,son,of,eddard,stark,<END>
why,not,the,king,<END>
karhold,declared,for,stannis,<END>
my,uncle,declared,for,stannis,in,hopes,it,might,provoke,the,lannisters,to,take,poor,harry's,head,<END>
should,my,brother,die,karhold,should,pass,to,me,but,my,uncles,want,my,birthright,for,their,own,<END>
once,cregan,gets,a,child,by,me,they,won't,need,me,anymore,<END>
he's,buried,two,wives,already,<END>
she,rubbed,away,a,tear,angrily,the,way,arya,might,have,done,it,<END>
will,you,help,me,<END>
marriages,and,inheritance,are,matters,for,the,king,my,lady,<END>
i,will,write,to,stannis,on,your,behalf,but,alys,karstark,laughed,but,it,was,the,laughter,of,despair,<END>
write,but,do,not,look,for,a,reply,<END>
stannis,will,be,dead,before,he,gets,your,message,<END>
my,uncle,will,see,to,that,<END>
what,do,you,mean,<END>
arnolf,is,rushing,to,winterfell,'tis,true,but,only,so,he,might,put,his,dagger,in,your,king's,back,<END>
he,cast,his,lot,with,roose,bolton,long,ago,for,gold,the,promise,of,a,pardon,and,poor,harry's,head,<END>

men,had,a,different,smell,than,women,and,there,was,a,hint,of,orange,in,the,air,as,well,<END>
the,priest,was,fond,of,chewing,orange,rinds,to,sweeten,his,breath,whenever,he,could,get,them,<END>

poor,child,said,the,kindly,man,<END>
would,you,like,to,have,your,eyes,back,<END>
ask,and,you,shall,see,<END>
he,asked,the,same,question,every,morning,<END>
i,may,want,them,on,the,morrow,<END>
not,today,<END>
her,face,was,still,water,hiding,all,revealing,nothing,<END>
as,you,will,<END>
she,could,hear,him,peeling,the,egg,then,a,faint,silvery,clink,as,he,picked,up,the,salt,spoon,<END>
he,liked,his,eggs,well,salted,<END>
where,did,my,poor,blind,girl,go,begging,last,night,<END>
the,inn,of,the,green,eel,<END>
and,what,three,new,things,do,you,know,that,you,did,not,know,when,last,you,left,us,<END>

when,he,is,dead,that,will,be,a,new,thing,<END>
when,he,is,dead,there,will,be,a,choosing,and,the,knives,will,come,out,<END>
that,was,the,way,of,it,in,braavos,<END>
in,westeros,a,dead,king,was,followed,by,his,eldest,son,but,the,braavosi,had,no,kings,<END>
tormo,fregar,will,be,the,new,sealord,<END>

he,never,spoke,with,his,mouth,full,<END>
he,swallowed,and,said,some,men,say,there,is,wisdom,in,wine,<END>
such,men,are,fools,<END>
at,other,inns,other,names,are,being,bruited,about,never,doubt,<END>

i,know,that,some,men,are,saying,that,tormo,fregar,will,surely,be,the,new,sealord,she,answered,<END>
some,drunken,men,<END>
better,<END>
and,what,else,do,you,know,<END>
it,is,snowing,in,the,riverlands,in,westeros,she,almost,said,<END>
but,he,would,have,asked,her,how,she,knew,that,and,she,did,not,think,that,he,would,like,her,answer,<END>
she,chewed,her,lip,thinking,back,to,last,night,<END>
the,whore,s'vrone,is,with,child,<END>
she,is,not,certain,of,the,father,but,thinks,it,might,have,been,that,tyroshi,sellsword,that,she,killed,<END>
this,is,good,to,know,<END>
what,else,<END>
the,merling,queen,has,chosen,a,new,mermaid,to,take,the,place,of,the,one,that,drowned,<END>
she,is,the,daughter,of,a,prestayn,serving,maid,thirteen,and,penniless,but,lovely,<END>
so,are,they,all,at,the,beginning,said,the,priest,but,you,cannot,know,that,she,is,lovely,unless,you,have,seen,her,with,your,own,eyes,and,you,have,none,<END>
who,are,you,child,<END>
no,one,<END>
blind,beth,the,beggar,girl,is,who,i,see,<END>

valar,morghulis,<END>
valar,dohaeris,<END>
she,gathered,up,her,bowl,and,cup,knife,and,spoon,and,pushed,to,her,feet,<END>
last,of,all,she,grasped,her,stick,<END>
it,was,five,feet,long,slender,and,supple,thick,as,her,thumb,with,leather,wrapped,around,the,shaft,a,foot,from,the,top,<END>
better,than,eyes,once,you,learn,how,to,use,it,the,waif,had,told,her,<END>
that,was,a,lie,<END>
they,often,lied,to,her,to,test,her,<END>
no,stick,was,better,than,a,pair,of,eyes,<END>
it,was,good,to,have,though,so,she,always,kept,it,close,<END>
umma,had,taken,to,calling,her,stick,but,names,did,not,matter,<END>
she,was,her,<END>
no,one,<END>
i,am,no,one,<END>
just,a,blind,girl,just,a,servant,of,him,of,many,faces,<END>
each,night,at,supper,the,waif,brought,her,a,cup,of,milk,and,told,her,to,drink,it,down,<END>
the,drink,had,a,queer,bitter,taste,that,the,blind,girl,soon,learned,to,loathe,<END>
even,the,faint,smell,that,warned,her,what,it,was,before,it,touched,her,tongue,soon,made,her,feel,like,retching,but,she,drained,the,cup,all,the,same,<END>
how,long,must,i,be,blind,<END>
she,would,ask,<END>
until,darkness,is,as,sweet,to,you,as,light,the,waif,would,say,or,until,you,ask,us,for,your,eyes,<END>
ask,and,you,shall,see,<END>
and,then,you,will,send,me,away,<END>
better,blind,than,that,<END>
they,would,not,make,her,yield,<END>
on,the,day,she,had,woken,blind,the,waif,took,her,by,the,hand,and,led,her,through,the,vaults,and,tunnels,of,the,rock,on,which,the,house,of,black,and,white,was,built,up,the,steep,stone,steps,into,the,temple,proper,<END>
count,the,steps,as,you,climb,she,had,said,<END>
let,your,fingers,brush,the,wall,<END>
there,are,markings,there,invisible,to,the,eye,plain,to,the,touch,<END>
that,was,her,first,lesson,<END>
there,had,been,many,more,<END>
poisons,and,potions,were,for,the,afternoons,<END>
she,had,smell,and,touch,and,taste,to,help,her,but,touch,and,taste,could,be,perilous,when,grinding,poisons,and,with,some,of,the,waif's,more,toxic,concoctions,even,smell,was,less,than,safe,<END>
burned,pinky,tips,and,blistered,lips,became,familiar,to,her,and,once,she,made,herself,so,sick,she,could,not,keep,down,any,food,for,days,<END>
supper,was,for,language,lessons,<END>
the,blind,girl,understood,braavosi,and,could,speak,it,passably,she,had,even,lost,most,of,her,barbaric,accent,but,the,kindly,man,was,not,content,<END>
he,was,insisting,that,she,improve,her,high,valyrian,and,learn,the,tongues,of,lys,and,pentos,too,<END>
in,the,evening,she,played,the,lying,game,with,the,waif,but,without,eyes,to,see,the,game,was,very,different,<END>
sometimes,all,she,had,to,go,on,was,tone,and,choice,of,words,other,times,the,waif,allowed,her,to,lay,hands,upon,her,face,<END>
at,first,the,game,was,much,much,harder,the,next,thing,to,impossible,but,just,when,she,was,near,the,point,of,screaming,with,frustration,it,all,became,much,easier,<END>
she,learned,to,hear,the,lies,to,feel,them,in,the,play,of,the,muscles,around,the,mouth,and,eyes,<END>
many,of,her,other,duties,had,remained,the,same,but,as,she,went,about,them,she,stumbled,over,furnishings,walked,into,walls,dropped,trays,got,hopelessly,helplessly,lost,inside,the,temple,<END>
once,she,almost,fell,headlong,down,the,steps,but,syrio,forel,had,taught,her,balance,in,another,lifetime,when,she,was,the,girl,called,arya,and,somehow,she,recovered,and,caught,herself,in,time,<END>
some,nights,she,might,have,cried,herself,to,sleep,if,she,had,still,been,arry,or,weasel,or,cat,or,even,arya,of,house,stark,but,no,one,had,no,tears,<END>
without,eyes,even,the,simplest,task,was,perilous,<END>
she,burned,herself,a,dozen,times,as,she,worked,with,umma,in,the,kitchens,<END>

to,the,east,the,massive,brick,walls,of,meereen,shimmered,through,the,morning,heat,<END>
that,was,the,refuge,these,poor,fools,had,hoped,to,reach,<END>

all,three,of,the,would-be,escapees,were,dead,before,nurse,gathered,up,the,reins,again,<END>
the,mule,cart,rumbled,on,<END>
their,master's,camp,was,south,and,east,of,the,harridan,almost,in,its,shadow,and,spread,over,several,acres,<END>
the,humble,tent,of,yezzan,zo,qaggaz,proved,to,be,a,palace,of,lemon-colored,silk,<END>
gilded,harpies,stood,atop,the,center,poles,of,each,of,its,nine,peaked,roofs,shining,in,the,sun,<END>
lesser,tents,ringed,it,on,all,sides,<END>
those,are,the,dwellings,of,our,noble,master's,cooks,concubines,and,warriors,and,a,few,less-favored,kinsmen,nurse,told,them,but,you,little,darlings,shall,have,the,rare,privilege,of,sleeping,within,yezzan's,own,pavilion,<END>
it,pleases,him,to,keep,his,treasures,close,<END>
he,frowned,at,mormont,<END>
not,you,bear,<END>
you,are,big,and,ugly,you,will,be,chained,outside,<END>
the,knight,did,not,respond,<END>
first,all,of,you,must,be,fitted,for,collars,<END>
the,collars,were,made,of,iron,lightly,gilded,to,make,them,glitter,in,the,light,<END>
yezzan's,name,was,incised,into,the,metal,in,valyrian,glyphs,and,a,pair,of,tiny,bells,were,affixed,below,the,ears,so,the,wearer's,every,step,produced,a,merry,little,tinkling,sound,<END>
jorah,mormont,accepted,his,collar,in,a,sullen,silence,but,penny,began,to,cry,as,the,armorer,was,fastening,her,own,into,place,<END>
it's,so,heavy,she,complained,<END>
tyrion,squeezed,her,hand,<END>
it's,solid,gold,he,lied,<END>
in,westeros,highborn,ladies,dream,of,such,a,necklace,<END>
better,a,collar,than,a,brand,<END>

he,remembered,shae,and,the,way,the,golden,chain,had,glimmered,as,he,twisted,it,tighter,and,tighter,about,her,throat,<END>
afterward,nurse,had,ser,jorah's,chains,fastened,to,a,stake,near,the,cookfire,whilst,he,escorted,the,two,dwarfs,inside,the,master's,pavilion,and,showed,them,where,they,would,sleep,in,a,carpeted,alcove,separated,from,the,main,tent,by,walls,of,yellow,silk,<END>
they,would,share,this,space,with,yezzan's,other,treasures,a,boy,with,twisted,hairy,goat,legs,a,two-headed,girl,out,of,mantarys,a,bearded,woman,and,a,willowy,creature,called,sweets,who,dressed,in,moonstones,and,myrish,lace,<END>

a,grotesquerie,tyrion,realized,<END>
somewhere,some,god,is,laughing,<END>

the,bearded,woman,spoke,an,incomprehensible,variety,of,ghiscari,the,goat,boy,some,guttural,sailor's,pidgin,called,the,trade,talk,<END>
the,two-headed,girl,was,feebleminded,one,head,was,no,bigger,than,an,orange,and,did,not,speak,at,all,the,other,had,filed,teeth,and,was,like,to,growl,at,anyone,who,came,too,close,to,her,cage,<END>
but,sweets,was,fluent,in,four,tongues,one,of,them,high,valyrian,<END>
what,is,the,master,like,<END>
penny,asked,anxiously,<END>
his,eyes,are,yellow,and,he,stinks,said,sweets,<END>
ten,years,ago,he,went,to,sothoros,and,he,has,been,rotting,from,the,inside,out,ever,since,<END>

they,had,only,the,afternoon,to,learn,the,ways,of,chattel,<END>
yezzan's,body,slaves,filled,a,tub,with,hot,water,and,the,dwarfs,were,allowed,to,bathe,penny,first,then,tyrion,<END>
afterward,another,slave,spread,a,stinging,ointment,across,the,cuts,on,his,back,to,keep,them,from,mortifying,then,covered,them,with,a,cool,poultice,<END>
penny's,hair,was,cut,and,tyrion's,beard,got,a,trim,<END>
they,were,given,soft,slippers,and,fresh,clothing,plain,but,clean,<END>
as,evening,fell,nurse,returned,to,tell,them,that,it,was,time,to,don,their,mummer's,plate,<END>
yezzan,would,be,hosting,the,yunkish,supreme,commander,the,noble,yurkhaz,zo,yunzak,and,they,would,be,expected,to,perform,<END>

not,this,night,tyrion,said,<END>
let,us,joust,for,our,master,first,and,save,the,bear,for,some,other,time,<END>
just,so,<END>
after,your,capers,are,concluded,you,will,help,serve,and,pour,<END>
see,that,you,do,not,spill,on,the,guests,or,it,will,go,ill,for,you,<END>
a,juggler,began,the,evening's,frolics,<END>
then,came,a,trio,of,energetic,tumblers,<END>
after,them,the,goat-legged,boy,came,out,and,did,a,grotesque,jig,whilst,one,of,yurkhaz's,slaves,played,on,a,bone,flute,<END>
tyrion,had,half,a,mind,to,ask,him,if,he,knew,the,rains,of,castamere,<END>
as,they,waited,their,own,turn,to,perform,he,watched,yezzan,and,his,guests,<END>
the,human,prune,in,the,place,of,honor,was,evidently,the,yunkish,supreme,commander,who,looked,about,as,formidable,as,a,loose,stool,<END>
a,dozen,other,yunkish,lords,attended,him,<END>
two,sellsword,captains,were,on,hand,as,well,each,accompanied,by,a,dozen,men,of,his,company,<END>
one,was,an,elegant,pentoshi,grey-haired,and,clad,in,silk,but,for,his,cloak,a,ragged,thing,sewn,from,dozens,of,strips,of,torn,bloodstained,cloth,<END>
the,other,captain,was,the,man,who'd,tried,to,buy,them,that,morning,the,brown-skinned,bidder,with,the,saltand-pepper,beard,<END>
brown,ben,plumm,sweets,named,him,<END>
captain,of,the,second,sons,<END>

tyrion,had,not,mastered,half,of,groat's,old,tricks,but,he,could,ride,the,sow,fall,off,when,he,was,meant,to,roll,and,pop,back,onto,his,feet,<END>
all,of,that,proved,well,received,<END>
the,sight,of,little,people,running,about,drunkenly,and,whacking,at,one,another,with,wooden,weapons,appeared,to,be,just,as,hilarious,in,a,siege,camp,by,slaver's,bay,as,at,joffrey's,wedding,feast,in,king's,landing,<END>
contempt,thought,tyrion,the,universal,tongue,<END>
their,master,yezzan,laughed,loudest,and,longest,whenever,one,of,his,dwarfs,suffered,a,fall,or,took,a,blow,his,whole,vast,body,shaking,like,suet,in,an,earthquake,his,guests,waited,to,see,how,yurkhaz,no,yunzak,responded,before,joining,in,<END>
the,supreme,commander,appeared,so,frail,that,tyrion,was,afraid,laughing,might,kill,him,<END>
when,penny's,helm,was,struck,off,and,flew,into,the,lap,of,a,sour-faced,yunkishman,in,a,striped,green-and-gold,tokar,yurkhaz,cackled,like,a,chicken,<END>
when,said,lord,reached,inside,the,helm,and,drew,out,a,large,purple,melon,dribbling,pulp,he,wheezed,until,his,face,turned,the,same,color,as,the,fruit,<END>
he,turned,to,his,host,and,whispered,something,that,made,their,master,chortle,and,lick,his,lips,though,there,was,a,hint,of,anger,in,those,slitted,yellow,eyes,it,seemed,to,tyrion,<END>
afterward,the,dwarfs,stripped,off,their,wooden,armor,and,the,sweat-soaked,clothing,beneath,and,changed,into,the,fresh,yellow,tunics,that,had,been,provided,them,for,serving,<END>
tyrion,was,given,a,flagon,of,purple,wine,penny,a,flagon,of,water,<END>
they,moved,about,the,tent,filling,cups,their,slippered,feet,whispering,over,thick,carpets,<END>
it,was,harder,work,than,it,appeared,<END>
before,long,his,legs,were,cramping,badly,and,one,of,the,cuts,on,his,back,had,begun,to,bleed,again,the,red,seeping,through,the,yellow,linen,of,his,tunic,<END>
tyrion,bit,his,tongue,and,kept,on,pouring,<END>
most,of,the,guests,paid,them,no,more,mind,than,they,did,the,other,slaves,but,one,yunkishman,declared,drunkenly,that,yezzan,should,make,the,two,dwarfs,fuck,and,another,demanded,to,know,how,tyrion,had,lost,his,nose,<END>
i,shoved,it,up,your,wife's,cunt,and,she,bit,it,off,he,almost,replied,but,the,storm,had,persuaded,him,that,he,did,not,want,to,die,as,yet,so,instead,he,said,it,was,cut,off,to,punish,me,for,insolence,lord,<END>
then,a,lord,in,a,blue,tokar,fringed,with,tiger's,eyes,recalled,that,tyrion,had,boasted,of,his,skill,at,cyvasse,on,the,auction,block,<END>
let,us,put,him,to,the,test,he,said,<END>
a,table,and,set,of,pieces,was,duly,produced,<END>
a,scant,few,moments,later,the,red-faced,lord,shoved,the,table,over,in,fury,scattering,the,pieces,across,the,carpets,to,the,sound,of,yunkish,laughter,<END>
you,should,have,let,him,win,penny,whispered,<END>
brown,ben,plumm,lifted,the,fallen,table,smiling,<END>
try,me,next,dwarf,<END>
when,i,was,younger,the,second,sons,took,contract,with,volantis,<END>

my,noble,master,decides,when,and,who,i,play,<END>
tyrion,turned,to,yezzan,<END>
master,<END>
the,yellow,lord,seemed,amused,by,the,notion,<END>
what,stakes,do,you,propose,captain,<END>
if,i,win,give,this,slave,to,me,said,plumm,<END>
no,yezzan,zo,qaggaz,said,<END>
but,if,you,can,defeat,my,dwarf,you,may,have,the,price,i,paid,for,him,in,gold,<END>
done,the,sellsword,said,<END>
the,scattered,pieces,were,picked,up,off,the,carpet,and,they,sat,down,to,play,<END>
tyrion,won,the,first,game,<END>
plumm,took,the,second,for,double,the,stakes,<END>
as,they,set,up,for,their,third,contest,the,dwarf,studied,his,opponent,<END>
brown-skinned,his,cheeks,and,jaw,covered,by,a,close-cropped,bristly,beard,of,grey,and,white,his,face,creased,by,a,thousand,wrinkles,and,a,few,old,scars,plumm,had,an,amiable,look,to,him,especially,when,he,smiled,<END>
the,faithful,retainer,tyrion,decided,<END>
every,man's,favorite,nuncle,full,of,chuckles,and,old,sayings,and,roughspun,wisdom,<END>
it,was,all,sham,<END>
those,smiles,never,touched,plumm's,eyes,where,greed,hid,behind,a,veil,of,caution,<END>
hungry,but,wary,this,one,<END>
the,sellsword,was,nearly,as,bad,a,player,as,the,yunkish,lord,had,been,but,his,play,was,stolid,and,tenacious,rather,than,bold,<END>
his,opening,arrays,were,different,every,time,yet,all,the,same,conservative,defensive,passive,<END>
he,does,not,play,to,win,tyrion,realized,<END>
he,plays,so,as,not,to,lose,<END>
it,worked,in,their,second,game,when,the,little,man,overreached,himself,with,an,unsound,assault,<END>
it,did,not,work,in,the,third,game,nor,the,fourth,nor,the,fifth,which,proved,to,be,their,last,<END>
near,the,end,of,that,final,contest,with,his,fortress,in,ruins,his,dragon,dead,elephants,before,him,and,heavy,horse,circling,round,his,rear,plumm,looked,up,smiling,and,said,yollo,wins,again,<END>
death,in,four,<END>

tyrion,tapped,his,dragon,<END>
i,was,lucky,<END>
perhaps,you,should,give,my,head,a,good,rub,before,our,next,game,captain,<END>
some,of,that,luck,might,rub,off,on,your,fingers,<END>
you,will,still,lose,but,you,might,give,me,a,better,game,<END>
grinning,he,pushed,back,from,the,cyvasse,table,picked,up,his,wine,flagon,and,returned,to,pouring,with,yezzan,zo,qaggaz,considerably,richer,and,brown,ben,plumm,considerably,impoverished,<END>
his,gargantuan,master,had,fallen,off,into,drunken,sleep,during,the,third,game,his,goblet,slipping,from,his,yellowed,fingers,to,spill,its,contents,on,the,carpet,but,perhaps,he,would,be,pleased,when,he,awakened,<END>
when,the,supreme,commander,yurkhaz,zo,yunzak,departed,supported,by,a,pair,of,burly,slaves,that,seemed,to,be,a,general,signal,for,the,other,guests,to,take,their,leaves,as,well,<END>
after,the,tent,had,emptied,out,nurse,reappeared,to,tell,the,servers,that,they,might,make,their,own,feast,from,the,leavings,<END>
eat,quickly,<END>
all,this,must,be,clean,again,before,you,sleep,<END>
tyrion,was,on,his,knees,his,legs,aching,and,his,bloody,back,screaming,with,pain,trying,to,scrub,out,the,stain,that,the,noble,yezzan's,spilled,wine,had,left,upon,the,noble,yezzan's,carpet,when,the,overseer,tapped,his,cheek,gently,with,the,end,of,his,whip,<END>

neither,outlaws,nor,wolves,had,troubled,them,on,their,way,to,raventree,so,jaime,decided,to,return,by,a,different,route,<END>
if,the,gods,were,good,he,might,stumble,on,the,blackfish,or,lure,beric,dondarrion,into,an,unwise,attack,<END>
they,were,following,the,widow's,wash,when,they,ran,out,of,day,<END>
jaime,called,his,hostage,forward,and,asked,him,where,to,find,the,nearest,ford,and,the,boy,led,them,there,<END>
as,the,column,splashed,across,the,shallow,waters,the,sun,was,setting,behind,a,pair,of,grassy,hills,<END>

if,there,were,villagers,about,they,might,have,knowledge,of,ser,brynden,or,the,outlaws,<END>
lord,jonos,made,some,remark,about,whose,teats,they,were,he,recalled,to,the,blackwood,boy,as,they,rode,toward,the,darkening,hills,and,the,last,light,of,the,day,<END>
the,brackens,call,them,by,one,name,and,the,blackwoods,by,another,<END>
aye,my,lord,<END>
for,a,hundred,years,or,so,<END>
before,that,they,were,the,mother's,teats,or,just,the,teats,<END>
there,are,two,of,them,and,it,was,thought,that,they,resembled,i,can,see,what,they,resemble,<END>
jaime,found,himself,thinking,back,on,the,woman,in,the,tent,and,the,way,she'd,tried,to,hide,her,large,dark,nipples,<END>
what,changed,a,hundred,years,ago,<END>
aegon,the,unworthy,took,barba,bracken,as,his,mistress,the,bookish,boy,replied,<END>
she,was,a,very,buxom,wench,they,say,and,one,day,when,the,king,was,visiting,at,the,stone,hedge,he,went,out,hunting,and,saw,the,teats,and,named,them,for,his,mistress,<END>
aegon,the,fourth,had,died,long,before,jaime,had,been,born,but,he,recalled,enough,of,the,history,of,his,reign,to,guess,what,must,have,happened,next,<END>
only,later,he,put,the,bracken,girl,aside,and,took,up,with,a,blackwood,was,that,the,way,of,it,<END>
lady,melissa,hoster,confirmed,<END>
missy,they,called,her,<END>
there's,a,statue,of,her,in,our,godswood,<END>
she,was,much,more,beautiful,than,barba,bracken,but,slender,and,barba,was,heard,to,say,that,missy,was,flat,as,a,boy,<END>
when,king,aegon,heard,he,gave,her,barba's,teats,<END>
jaime,laughed,<END>
how,did,all,this,begin,between,blackwood,and,bracken,<END>
is,it,written,down,<END>
it,is,my,lord,the,boy,said,but,some,of,the,histories,were,penned,by,their,maesters,and,some,by,ours,centuries,after,the,events,that,they,purport,to,chronicle,<END>
it,goes,back,to,the,age,of,heroes,<END>
the,blackwoods,were,kings,in,those,days,<END>
the,brackens,were,petty,lords,renowned,for,breeding,horses,<END>
rather,than,pay,their,king,his,just,due,they,used,the,gold,their,horses,brought,them,to,hire,swords,and,cast,him,down,<END>
when,did,all,this,happen,<END>
five,hundred,years,before,the,andals,<END>
a,thousand,if,the,true,history,is,to,be,believed,<END>
only,no,one,knows,when,the,andals,crossed,the,narrow,sea,<END>
the,true,history,says,four,thousand,years,have,passed,since,then,but,some,maesters,claim,that,it,was,only,two,<END>
past,a,certain,point,all,the,dates,grow,hazy,and,confused,and,the,clarity,of,history,becomes,the,fog,of,legend,<END>
tyrion,would,like,this,one,<END>
they,could,talk,from,dusk,to,dawn,arguing,about,books,<END>
for,a,moment,his,bitterness,toward,his,brother,was,forgotten,until,he,remembered,what,the,imp,had,done,<END>
so,you,are,fighting,over,a,crown,that,one,of,you,took,from,the,other,back,when,the,casterlys,still,held,casterly,rock,is,that,the,root,of,it,<END>
the,crown,of,a,kingdom,that,has,not,existed,for,thousands,of,years,<END>
he,chuckled,<END>
so,many,years,so,many,wars,so,many,kings,you'd,think,someone,would,have,made,a,peace,<END>
someone,did,my,lord,<END>
many,someones,<END>
we've,had,a,hundred,peaces,with,the,brackens,many,sealed,with,marriages,<END>
there's,blackwood,blood,in,every,bracken,and,bracken,blood,in,every,blackwood,<END>
the,old,king's,peace,lasted,half,a,century,<END>
but,then,some,fresh,quarrel,broke,out,and,the,old,wounds,opened,and,began,to,bleed,again,<END>
that's,how,it,always,happens,my,father,says,<END>
so,long,as,men,remember,the,wrongs,done,to,their,forebears,no,peace,will,ever,last,<END>
so,we,go,on,century,after,century,with,us,hating,the,brackens,and,them,hating,us,<END>
my,father,says,there,will,never,be,an,end,to,it,<END>
there,could,be,<END>
how,my,lord,<END>
the,old,wounds,never,heal,my,father,says,<END>
my,father,had,a,saying,too,<END>
never,wound,a,foe,when,you,can,kill,him,<END>
dead,men,don't,claim,vengeance,<END>
their,sons,do,said,hoster,apologetically,<END>
not,if,you,kill,the,sons,as,well,<END>
ask,the,casterlys,about,that,if,you,doubt,me,<END>
ask,lord,and,lady,tarbeck,or,the,reynes,of,castamere,<END>
ask,the,prince,of,dragonstone,<END>
for,an,instant,the,deep,red,clouds,that,crowned,the,western,hills,reminded,him,of,rhaegar's,children,all,wrapped,up,in,crimson,cloaks,<END>
is,that,why,you,killed,all,the,starks,<END>
not,all,said,jaime,<END>
lord,eddard's,daughters,live,<END>
one,has,just,been,wed,the,other,brienne,where,are,you,<END>

if,the,gods,are,good,she'll,forget,she,was,a,stark,<END>
she'll,wed,some,burly,blacksmith,or,fat-faced,innkeep,fill,his,house,with,children,and,never,need,to,fear,that,some,knight,might,come,along,to,smash,their,heads,against,a,wall,<END>
the,gods,are,good,his,hostage,said,uncertainly,<END>
you,go,on,believing,that,<END>
jaime,let,honor,feel,his,spurs,<END>

the,war,had,been,here,too,blackened,orchards,and,the,scorched,shells,of,broken,houses,testified,to,that,<END>

between,a,duck,pond,and,a,blacksmith's,forge,he,came,upon,the,tree,that,gave,the,place,its,name,an,oak,ancient,and,tall,<END>
its,gnarled,roots,twisted,in,and,out,of,the,earth,like,a,nest,of,slow,brown,serpents,and,hundreds,of,old,copper,pennies,had,been,nailed,to,its,huge,trunk,<END>

the,nanny,goat,that,hot,harry,merrell,found,rooting,through,a,vegetable,garden,was,the,only,living,creature,to,be,seen,but,the,village,had,a,holdfast,as,strong,as,any,in,the,riverlands,with,thick,stone,walls,twelve,feet,high,and,jaime,knew,that,was,where,he'd,find,the,villagers,<END>
they,hid,behind,those,walls,when,raiders,came,that's,why,there's,still,a,village,here,<END>
and,they,are,hiding,there,again,from,me,<END>
he,rode,honor,up,to,the,holdfast,gates,<END>
you,in,the,holdfast,<END>

a,dozen,different,sorts,of,meat,and,fish,were,served,camel,crocodile,singing,squid,lacquered,ducks,and,spiny,grubs,with,goat,and,ham,and,horse,for,those,whose,tastes,were,less,exotic,<END>

this,is,peace,she,told,herself,<END>
this,is,what,i,wanted,what,i,worked,for,this,is,why,i,married,hizdahr,<END>
so,why,does,it,taste,so,much,like,defeat,<END>
it,is,only,for,a,little,while,more,my,love,hizdahr,had,assured,her,<END>
the,yunkai'i,will,soon,be,gone,and,their,allies,and,hirelings,with,them,<END>

our,port,is,open,once,again,and,ships,are,being,permitted,to,come,and,go,<END>
they,are,permitting,that,yes,she,had,replied,but,their,warships,remain,<END>
they,can,close,their,fingers,around,our,throat,again,whenever,they,wish,<END>
they,have,opened,a,slave,market,within,sight,of,my,walls,<END>
outside,our,walls,sweet,queen,<END>
that,was,a,condition,of,the,peace,that,yunkai,would,be,free,to,trade,in,slaves,as,before,unmolested,<END>
in,their,own,city,<END>
not,where,i,have,to,see,it,<END>
the,wise,masters,had,established,their,slave,pens,and,auction,block,just,south,of,the,skahazadhan,where,the,wide,brown,river,flowed,into,slaver's,bay,<END>
they,are,mocking,me,to,my,face,making,a,show,of,how,powerless,i,am,to,stop,them,<END>

let,her,noble,husband,make,the,speeches,and,laugh,at,the,feeble,yunkish,japes,<END>
that,was,a,king's,right,and,a,king's,duty,<END>
much,of,the,talk,about,the,table,was,of,the,matches,to,be,fought,upon,the,morrow,<END>
barsena,blackhair,was,going,to,face,a,boar,his,tusks,against,her,dagger,<END>

bent-backed,wrinkled,and,toothless,he,was,carried,to,the,table,by,two,strapping,slaves,<END>
the,other,yunkish,lords,were,hardly,more,impressive,<END>
one,was,small,and,stunted,though,the,slave,soldiers,who,attended,him,were,grotesquely,tall,and,thin,<END>
the,third,was,young,fit,and,dashing,but,so,drunk,that,dany,could,scarce,understand,a,word,he,said,<END>

the,sellswords,were,a,different,matter,<END>

bloodbeard,from,the,company,of,the,cat,made,enough,noise,for,him,and,a,dozen,more,<END>
a,huge,man,with,a,great,bush,of,beard,and,a,prodigious,appetite,for,wine,and,women,he,bellowed,belched,farted,like,a,thunderclap,and,pinched,every,serving,girl,who,came,within,his,reach,<END>
from,time,to,time,he,would,pull,one,down,into,his,lap,to,squeeze,her,breasts,and,fondle,her,between,the,legs,<END>
the,second,sons,were,represented,too,<END>
if,daario,were,here,this,meal,would,end,in,blood,<END>
no,promised,peace,could,ever,have,persuaded,her,captain,to,permit,brown,ben,plumm,to,stroll,back,into,meereen,and,leave,alive,<END>
dany,had,sworn,that,no,harm,would,come,to,the,seven,envoys,and,commanders,though,that,had,not,been,enough,for,the,yunkai'i,<END>

to,balance,the,three,yunkish,nobles,and,four,sellsword,captains,meereen,sent,seven,of,its,own,out,to,the,siege,camp,hizdahr's,sister,two,of,his,cousins,dany's,bloodrider,jhogo,her,admiral,groleo,the,unsullied,captain,hero,and,daario,naharis,<END>

we,would,not,want,them,making,bloody,mischief,amongst,the,yunkai'i,<END>
the,shavepate,was,absent,as,well,<END>
the,first,thing,hizdahr,had,done,upon,being,crowned,was,to,remove,him,from,command,of,the,brazen,beasts,replacing,him,with,his,own,cousin,the,plump,and,pasty,marghaz,zo,loraq,<END>
it,is,for,the,best,<END>

her,peace,did,not,please,him,her,marriage,pleased,him,less,and,he,had,been,furious,at,being,deceived,by,the,dornishmen,<END>

then,began,the,entertainments,<END>
a,troupe,of,yunkish,castrati,owned,by,yurkhaz,zo,yunzak,sang,them,songs,in,the,ancient,tongue,of,the,old,empire,their,voices,high,and,sweet,and,impossibly,pure,<END>

did,i,cheat,you,on,your,pay,<END>
never,that,said,brown,ben,but,it's,not,all,about,the,coin,your,high-andmightiness,<END>
i,learned,that,a,long,time,back,at,my,first,battle,<END>
morning,after,the,fight,i,was,rooting,through,the,dead,looking,for,the,odd,bit,o',plunder,as,it,were,<END>

he,was,covered,with,flies,all,crusty,with,dried,blood,might,be,why,no,one,else,had,touched,him,but,under,them,he,wore,this,studded,jerkin,looked,to,be,good,leather,<END>

gold,your,worship,sweet,yellow,gold,<END>
enough,for,any,man,to,live,like,a,lord,for,the,rest,o',his,days,<END>

there,he,was,with,all,his,coin,lying,in,the,blood,and,mud,with,his,fucking,arm,cut,off,<END>
and,that's,the,lesson,see,<END>
silver's,sweet,and,gold's,our,mother,but,once,you're,dead,they're,worth,less,than,that,last,shit,you,take,as,you,lie,dying,<END>

you,don't,never,want,to,trust,a,sellsword,m'lady,<END>

the,white,knight,appeared,at,once,<END>
your,grace,<END>
how,much,did,you,hear,<END>

he,was,not,wrong,<END>

as,daario,naharis,once,removed,the,other,captains,of,the,stormcrows,<END>
the,old,knight,looked,uncomfortable,<END>
perhaps,<END>
i,would,not,know,your,grace,<END>
no,she,thought,you,are,too,honest,and,too,honorable,<END>
if,not,the,yunkai'i,employ,three,other,companies,<END>
rogues,and,cutthroats,scum,of,a,hundred,battlefields,ser,barristan,warned,with,captains,full,as,treacherous,as,plumm,<END>

once,you'll,recall,i,convinced,the,second,sons,and,stormcrows,to,join,us,<END>
if,your,grace,wishes,a,privy,word,with,gylo,rhegan,or,the,tattered,prince,i,could,bring,them,up,to,your,apartments,<END>
this,is,not,the,time,<END>
too,many,eyes,too,many,ears,<END>
their,absence,would,be,noted,even,if,you,could,separate,them,discreetly,from,the,yunkai'i,<END>
we,must,find,some,quieter,way,of,reaching,out,to,them,not,tonight,but,soon,<END>
as,you,command,<END>
though,i,fear,this,is,not,a,task,for,which,i,am,well,suited,<END>

prince,quentyn,will,protect,me,<END>
she,drew,the,dornish,prince,inside,with,her,to,stand,above,the,pit,<END>
the,dragons,craned,their,necks,around,gazing,at,them,with,burning,eyes,<END>
viserion,had,shattered,one,chain,and,melted,the,others,<END>

her,voice,echoed,off,the,scorched,stone,walls,<END>
it,sounded,small,a,girl's,voice,not,the,voice,of,a,queen,and,conqueror,nor,the,glad,voice,of,a,new-made,bride,<END>
rhaegal,roared,in,answer,and,fire,filled,the,pit,a,spear,of,red,and,yellow,<END>

there,is,no,shame,in,that,<END>
my,children,have,grown,wild,and,angry,in,the,dark,<END>
you,you,mean,to,ride,them,<END>
one,of,them,<END>
all,i,know,of,dragons,is,what,my,brother,told,me,when,i,was,a,girl,and,some,i,read,in,books,but,it,is,said,that,even,aegon,the,conqueror,never,dared,mount,vhagar,or,meraxes,nor,did,his,sisters,ride,balerion,the,black,dread,<END>
dragons,live,longer,than,men,some,for,hundreds,of,years,so,balerion,had,other,riders,after,aegon,died,but,no,rider,ever,flew,two,dragons,<END>

smoke,rose,between,his,teeth,and,deep,down,in,his,throat,they,could,see,gold,fire,churning,<END>
they,are,they,are,fearsome,creatures,<END>
they,are,dragons,quentyn,<END>
dany,stood,on,her,toes,and,kissed,him,lightly,once,on,each,cheek,<END>

the,young,prince,swallowed,<END>
i,i,have,the,blood,of,the,dragon,in,me,as,well,your,grace,<END>

my,father's,favorite,palace,<END>
it,would,please,me,to,show,them,to,you,one,day,<END>
they,are,all,of,pink,marble,with,pools,and,fountains,overlooking,the,sea,<END>
they,sound,lovely,<END>
she,drew,him,away,from,the,pit,<END>
he,does,not,belong,here,<END>
he,should,never,have,come,<END>
you,ought,to,return,there,<END>
my,court,is,no,safe,place,for,you,i,fear,<END>
you,have,more,enemies,than,you,know,<END>

i,will,not,run,from,slaves,and,sell,swords,<END>
then,you,truly,are,a,fool,prince,frog,<END>
dany,gave,her,wild,children,one,last,lingering,look,<END>
she,could,hear,the,dragons,screaming,as,she,led,the,boy,back,to,the,door,and,see,the,play,of,light,against,the,bricks,reflections,of,their,fires,<END>
if,i,look,back,i,am,lost,<END>
ser,barristan,will,have,summoned,a,pair,of,sedan,chairs,to,carry,us,back,up,to,the,banquet,but,the,climb,can,still,be,wearisome,<END>
behind,them,the,great,iron,doors,closed,with,a,resounding,clang,<END>
tell,me,of,this,other,daenerys,<END>
i,know,less,than,i,should,of,the,history,of,my,father's,kingdom,<END>
i,never,had,a,maester,growing,up,<END>
only,a,brother,<END>
it,would,be,my,pleasure,your,grace,said,quentyn,<END>
it,was,well,past,midnight,before,the,last,of,their,guests,took,their,leave,and,dany,retired,to,her,own,apartments,to,join,her,lord,and,king,<END>
hizdahr,at,least,was,happy,if,somewhat,drunk,<END>
i,keep,my,promises,he,told,her,as,irri,and,jhiqui,were,robing,them,for,bed,<END>
you,wished,for,peace,and,it,is,yours,<END>
and,you,wished,for,blood,and,soon,enough,i,must,give,it,to,you,dany,thought,but,what,she,said,was,i,am,grateful,<END>
the,excitement,of,the,day,had,inflamed,her,husband's,passions,<END>
no,sooner,had,her,handmaids,retired,for,the,night,than,he,tore,the,robe,from,her,and,tumbled,her,backwards,into,bed,<END>
dany,slid,her,arms,around,him,and,let,him,have,his,way,<END>
drunk,as,he,was,she,knew,he,would,not,be,inside,her,long,<END>

her,noble,husband,was,soon,fast,asleep,<END>
daenerys,could,only,twist,and,turn,beside,him,<END>
she,wanted,to,shake,him,wake,him,make,him,hold,her,kiss,her,fuck,her,again,but,even,if,he,did,he,would,fall,back,to,sleep,again,afterward,leaving,her,alone,in,the,darkness,<END>

theon,slipped,his,hand,through,hers,<END>
the,stumps,of,his,lost,fingers,tingled,as,he,drew,the,girl,to,her,feet,<END>
the,wolfskins,fell,away,from,her,<END>

it's,cold,outside,<END>
squirrel,had,stripped,down,to,her,smallclothes,and,was,rooting,through,a,carved,cedar,chest,in,search,of,something,warmer,<END>
in,the,end,she,settled,for,one,of,lord,ramsay's,quilted,doublets,and,a,well-worn,pair,of,breeches,that,flapped,about,her,legs,like,a,ship's,sails,in,a,storm,<END>
with,rowan's,help,theon,got,jeyne,poole,into,squirrel's,clothes,<END>
if,the,gods,are,good,and,the,guards,are,blind,she,may,pass,<END>
now,we,are,going,out,and,down,the,steps,theon,told,the,girl,<END>
keep,your,head,down,and,your,hood,up,<END>
follow,holly,<END>
don't,run,don't,cry,don't,speak,don't,look,anyone,in,the,eye,<END>

i,will,be,right,beside,you,theon,promised,as,squirrel,slipped,into,lady,arya's,bed,and,pulled,the,blanket,up,<END>
frenya,opened,the,bedchamber,door,<END>
you,give,her,a,good,wash,reek,<END>
asked,sour,alyn,as,they,emerged,<END>
grunt,gave,willow's,breast,a,squeeze,as,she,went,by,<END>
they,were,fortunate,in,his,choice,<END>
if,the,man,had,touched,jeyne,she,might,have,screamed,<END>
then,holly,would,have,opened,his,throat,for,him,with,the,knife,hidden,up,her,sleeve,<END>
willow,simply,twisted,away,and,past,him,<END>
for,a,moment,theon,felt,almost,giddy,<END>
they,never,looked,<END>
they,never,saw,<END>
we,walked,the,girl,right,by,them,<END>
but,on,the,steps,the,fear,returned,<END>
what,if,they,met,skinner,or,damon,dance-for-me,or,steelshanks,walton,<END>
or,ramsay,himself,<END>
gods,save,me,not,ramsay,anyone,but,him,<END>
what,use,was,it,to,smuggle,the,girl,out,of,her,bedchamber,<END>
they,were,still,inside,the,castle,with,every,gate,closed,and,barred,and,the,battlements,thick,with,sentries,<END>
like,as,not,the,guards,outside,the,keep,would,stop,them,<END>
holly,and,her,knife,would,be,of,small,use,against,six,men,in,mail,with,swords,and,spears,<END>
but,the,guards,outside,were,huddled,by,the,doors,backs,turned,against,the,icy,wind,and,blown,snow,<END>
even,the,serjeant,did,not,spare,them,more,than,a,quick,glance,<END>
theon,felt,a,stab,of,pity,for,him,and,his,men,<END>
ramsay,would,flay,them,all,when,he,learned,his,bride,was,gone,and,what,he,would,do,to,grunt,and,sour,alyn,did,not,bear,thinking,about,<END>
not,ten,yards,from,the,door,rowan,dropped,her,empty,pail,and,her,sisters,did,likewise,<END>
the,great,keep,was,already,lost,to,sight,behind,them,<END>
the,yard,was,a,white,wilderness,full,of,half-heard,sounds,that,echoed,strangely,amidst,the,storm,<END>
the,icy,trenches,rose,around,them,knee,high,then,waist,high,then,higher,than,their,heads,<END>
they,were,in,the,heart,of,winterfell,with,the,castle,all,around,them,but,no,sign,of,it,could,be,seen,<END>
they,might,have,easily,been,lost,amidst,the,land,of,always,winter,a,thousand,leagues,beyond,the,wall,<END>
it's,cold,jeyne,poole,whimpered,as,she,stumbled,along,at,theon's,side,<END>
and,soon,to,be,colder,<END>
beyond,the,castle,walls,winter,was,waiting,with,its,icy,teeth,<END>
if,we,get,that,far,<END>
this,way,he,said,when,they,came,to,a,junction,where,three,trenches,crossed,<END>
frenya,holly,go,with,them,rowan,said,<END>
we,will,be,along,with,abel,<END>
do,not,wait,for,us,<END>
and,with,that,she,whirled,and,plunged,into,the,snow,toward,the,great,hall,<END>
willow,and,myrtle,hurried,after,her,cloaks,snapping,in,the,wind,<END>
madder,and,madder,thought,theon,greyjoy,<END>
escape,had,seemed,unlikely,with,all,six,of,abel's,women,with,only,two,it,seemed,impossible,<END>
but,they,had,gone,too,far,to,return,the,girl,to,her,bedchamber,and,pretend,none,of,this,had,ever,happened,<END>
instead,he,took,jeyne,by,the,arm,and,drew,her,down,the,pathway,to,the,battlements,gate,<END>
only,a,halfgate,he,reminded,himself,<END>
even,if,the,guards,let,us,pass,there,is,no,way,through,the,outer,wall,<END>
on,other,nights,the,guards,had,allowed,theon,through,but,all,those,times,he'd,come,alone,<END>
he,would,not,pass,so,easily,with,three,serving,girls,in,tow,and,if,the,guards,looked,beneath,jeyne's,hood,and,recognized,lord,ramsay's,bride,the,passage,twisted,to,the,left,<END>
there,before,them,behind,a,veil,of,falling,snow,yawned,the,battlements,gate,flanked,by,a,pair,of,guards,<END>
in,their,wool,and,fur,and,leather,they,looked,as,big,as,bears,<END>
the,spears,they,held,were,eight,feet,tall,<END>
who,goes,there,<END>
one,called,out,<END>
theon,did,not,recognize,the,voice,<END>
most,of,the,man's,features,were,covered,by,the,scarf,about,his,face,<END>
only,his,eyes,could,be,seen,<END>
reek,is,that,you,<END>
yes,he,meant,to,say,<END>
instead,he,heard,himself,reply,theon,greyjoy,<END>
i,i,have,brought,some,women,for,you,<END>
you,poor,boys,must,be,freezing,said,holly,<END>
here,let,me,warm,you,up,<END>
she,slipped,past,the,guard's,spearpoint,and,reached,up,to,his,face,pulling,loose,the,half-frozen,scarf,to,plant,a,kiss,upon,his,mouth,<END>
and,as,their,lips,touched,her,blade,slid,through,the,meat,of,his,neck,just,below,the,ear,<END>
theon,saw,the,man's,eyes,widen,<END>
there,was,blood,on,holly's,lips,as,she,stepped,back,and,blood,dribbling,from,his,mouth,as,he,fell,<END>
the,second,guard,was,still,gaping,in,confusion,when,frenya,grabbed,the,shaft,of,his,spear,<END>
they,struggled,for,a,moment,tugging,till,the,woman,wrenched,the,weapon,from,his,fingers,and,clouted,him,across,the,temple,with,its,butt,<END>
as,he,stumbled,backwards,she,spun,the,spear,around,and,drove,its,point,through,his,belly,with,a,grunt,<END>
jeyne,poole,let,out,a,shrill,high,scream,<END>
oh,bloody,shit,said,holly,<END>
that,will,bring,the,kneelers,down,on,us,and,no,mistake,<END>
run,<END>
theon,clapped,one,hand,around,jeyne's,mouth,grabbed,her,about,the,waist,with,the,other,and,pulled,her,past,the,dead,and,dying,guards,through,the,gate,and,over,the,frozen,moat,<END>
and,perhaps,the,old,gods,were,still,watching,over,them,the,drawbridge,had,been,left,down,to,allow,winterfell's,defenders,to,cross,to,and,from,the,outer,battlements,more,quickly,<END>
from,behind,them,came,alarums,and,the,sounds,of,running,feet,then,the,blast,of,a,trumpet,from,the,ramparts,of,the,inner,wall,<END>
on,the,drawbridge,frenya,stopped,and,turned,<END>
go,on,<END>
i,will,hold,the,kneelers,here,<END>
the,bloody,spear,was,still,clutched,in,her,big,hands,<END>
theon,was,staggering,by,the,time,he,reached,the,foot,of,the,stair,<END>
he,slung,the,girl,over,his,shoulder,and,began,to,climb,<END>
jeyne,had,ceased,to,struggle,by,then,and,she,was,such,a,little,thing,besides,but,the,steps,were,slick,with,ice,beneath,soft,powdery,snow,and,halfway,up,he,lost,his,footing,and,went,down,hard,on,one,knee,<END>
the,pain,was,so,bad,he,almost,lost,the,girl,and,for,half,a,heartbeat,he,feared,this,was,as,far,as,he,would,go,<END>
but,holly,pulled,him,back,onto,his,feet,and,between,the,two,of,them,they,finally,got,jeyne,up,to,the,battlements,<END>
as,he,leaned,up,against,a,merlon,breathing,hard,theon,could,hear,the,shouting,from,below,where,frenya,was,fighting,half,a,dozen,guardsmen,in,the,snow,<END>
which,way,<END>
he,shouted,at,holly,<END>
where,do,we,go,now,<END>
how,do,we,get,out,<END>
the,fury,on,holly's,face,turned,to,horror,<END>
oh,fuck,me,bloody,<END>
the,rope,<END>

at,first,the,riders,seemed,to,have,the,advantage,riding,down,two,of,their,foes,and,slashing,the,ear,from,a,third,but,then,the,surviving,knights,began,to,attack,the,horses,and,one,by,one,the,riders,were,unmounted,and,slain,to,jhiqui's,great,disgust,<END>

the,battle,was,followed,by,the,day's,first,folly,a,tilt,between,a,pair,of,jousting,dwarfs,presented,by,one,of,the,yunkish,lords,that,hizdahr,had,invited,to,the,games,<END>
one,rode,a,hound,the,other,a,sow,<END>

their,antics,soon,had,belwas,snorting,laughter,though,dany's,smile,was,faint,and,forced,<END>
when,the,dwarf,in,red,tumbled,from,the,saddle,and,began,to,chase,his,sow,across,the,sands,whilst,the,dwarf,on,the,dog,galloped,after,him,whapping,at,his,buttocks,with,a,wooden,sword,she,said,this,is,sweet,and,silly,but,be,patient,my,sweet,said,hizdahr,<END>

the,boar,was,a,huge,beast,with,tusks,as,long,as,a,man's,forearm,and,small,eyes,that,swam,with,rage,<END>

shouting,she,edged,closer,to,the,boar,tossing,her,knife,from,hand,to,hand,<END>

the,lord,of,suet,was,not,so,bad,as,masters,went,<END>
sweets,had,been,right,about,that,<END>

most,of,the,others,were,only,biding,their,time,waiting,for,the,armies,of,volantis,to,arrive,<END>

the,pale,mare,does,not,carry,off,every,rider,<END>

that,was,a,bald-faced,lie,<END>
it,would,be,a,wonder,if,yezzan,lived,another,day,<END>
the,lord,of,suet,was,already,dying,from,whatever,hideous,disease,he,had,brought,back,from,sothoryos,it,seemed,to,tyrion,<END>

the,healer,said,he,needs,fresh,water,<END>
we,will,see,to,that,<END>
that,is,good,of,you,<END>

tyrion,opened,the,tent,flap,and,ushered,her,out,into,the,heat,of,a,meereenese,morning,<END>

yezzan's,other,slaves,had,refused,to,go,near,the,overseer,once,the,cramps,began,so,it,was,left,to,tyrion,to,keep,him,warm,and,bring,him,drinks,<END>

he's,made,for,it,<END>
we,don't,take,commands,from,that,freak,neither,<END>
no,thought,tyrion,<END>
even,amongst,slaves,there,were,lords,and,peasants,as,he,had,been,quick,to,learn,<END>
the,hermaphrodite,had,long,been,their,master's,special,pet,indulged,and,favored,and,the,noble,yezzan's,other,slaves,hated,him,for,it,<END>
the,soldiers,were,accustomed,to,taking,their,commands,from,their,masters,and,their,overseer,<END>

you,know,what,happens,to,slaves,who,try,to,escape,<END>

he,went,off,with,the,man,morgo,to,fetch,ser,jorah,mormont,from,his,cage,<END>
the,knight,had,not,adapted,well,to,bondage,<END>
when,called,upon,to,play,the,bear,and,carry,off,the,maiden,fair,he,had,been,sullen,and,uncooperative,shuffling,lifelessly,through,his,paces,when,he,deigned,to,take,part,in,their,mummery,at,all,<END>
though,he,had,not,attempted,escape,nor,offered,violence,to,his,captors,he,would,ignore,their,commands,oft,as,not,or,reply,with,muttered,curses,<END>
none,of,this,had,amused,nurse,who,made,his,displeasure,clear,by,confining,mormont,in,an,iron,cage,and,having,him,beaten,every,evening,as,the,sun,sank,into,slaver's,bay,<END>
the,knight,absorbed,the,beatings,silently,the,only,sounds,were,the,muttered,curses,of,the,slaves,who,beat,him,and,the,dull,thuds,of,their,clubs,pounding,against,ser,jorah's,bruised,and,battered,flesh,<END>
the,man,is,a,shell,tyrion,thought,the,first,time,he,saw,the,big,knight,beaten,<END>
i,should,have,held,my,tongue,and,let,zahrina,have,him,<END>
it,might,have,been,a,kinder,fate,than,this,<END>
mormont,emerged,from,the,cramped,confines,of,the,cage,bent,and,squinting,with,both,eyes,blackened,and,his,back,crusty,with,dried,blood,<END>
his,face,was,so,bruised,and,swollen,that,he,hardly,looked,human,<END>
he,was,naked,except,for,a,breechclout,a,filthy,bit,of,yellow,rag,<END>
you're,to,help,them,carry,water,morgo,told,him,<END>
ser,jorah's,only,reply,was,a,sullen,stare,<END>
some,men,would,sooner,die,free,than,live,a,slave,i,suppose,<END>
tyrion,was,not,stricken,with,that,affliction,himself,thankfully,but,if,mormont,murdered,morgo,the,other,slaves,might,not,draw,that,distinction,<END>
come,he,said,before,the,knight,did,something,brave,and,stupid,<END>
he,waddled,off,and,hoped,mormont,would,follow,<END>
the,gods,were,good,for,once,<END>
mormont,followed,<END>
two,pails,for,penny,two,for,tyrion,and,four,for,ser,jorah,two,in,either,hand,<END>
the,nearest,well,was,south,and,west,of,the,harridan,so,they,set,off,in,that,direction,the,bells,on,their,collars,ringing,merrily,with,every,step,<END>
no,one,paid,them,any,mind,<END>
they,were,just,slaves,fetching,water,for,their,master,<END>
wearing,a,collar,conferred,certain,advantages,particularly,a,gilded,collar,inscribed,with,the,name,of,yezzan,zo,qaggaz,<END>
the,chime,of,those,little,bells,proclaimed,their,value,to,anyone,with,ears,<END>
a,slave,was,only,as,important,as,his,master,yezzan,was,the,richest,man,in,the,yellow,city,and,had,brought,six,hundred,slave,soldiers,to,the,war,even,if,he,did,look,like,a,monstrous,yellow,slug,and,smell,of,piss,<END>
their,collars,gave,them,leave,to,go,anywhere,they,might,wish,within,the,camp,<END>
until,yezzan,dies,<END>
the,clanker,lords,had,their,slave,soldiers,drilling,in,the,nearest,field,<END>
the,clatter,of,the,chains,that,bound,them,made,a,harsh,metallic,music,as,they,marched,across,the,sand,in,lockstep,and,formed,up,with,their,long,spears,<END>
elsewhere,teams,of,slaves,were,raising,ramps,of,stone,and,sand,beneath,their,mangonels,and,scorpions,angling,them,upward,at,the,sky,the,better,to,defend,the,camp,should,the,black,dragon,return,<END>
it,made,the,dwarf,smile,to,see,them,sweating,and,cursing,as,they,wrestled,the,heavy,machines,onto,the,inclines,<END>
crossbows,were,much,in,evidence,as,well,<END>
every,other,man,seemed,to,be,clutching,one,with,a,quiverfull,of,bolts,hanging,from,his,hip,<END>
if,anyone,had,thought,to,ask,him,tyrion,could,have,told,them,not,to,bother,<END>
unless,one,of,those,long,iron,scorpion,bolts,chanced,to,find,an,eye,the,queen's,pet,monster,was,not,like,to,be,brought,down,by,such,toys,<END>
dragons,are,not,so,easy,to,kill,as,that,<END>
tickle,him,with,these,and,you'll,only,make,him,angry,<END>
the,eyes,were,where,a,dragon,was,most,vulnerable,<END>
the,eyes,and,the,brain,behind,them,<END>
not,the,underbelly,as,certain,old,tales,would,have,it,<END>
the,scales,there,were,just,as,tough,as,those,along,a,dragon's,back,and,flanks,<END>
and,not,down,the,gullet,either,<END>
that,was,madness,<END>
these,would-be,dragonslayers,might,as,well,try,to,quench,a,fire,with,a,spear,thrust,<END>
death,comes,out,of,the,dragon's,mouth,septon,barth,had,written,in,his,unnatural,history,but,death,does,not,go,in,that,way,<END>
farther,on,two,legions,from,new,ghis,were,facing,off,shield,wall,to,shield,wall,whilst,serjeants,in,iron,halfhelms,with,horsehair,crests,screamed,commands,in,their,own,incomprehensible,dialect,<END>
to,the,naked,eye,the,ghiscari,looked,more,formidable,than,the,yunkish,slave,soldiers,but,tyrion,nursed,doubts,<END>
the,legionaries,might,be,armed,and,organized,in,the,same,manner,as,unsullied,but,the,eunuchs,knew,no,other,life,whereas,the,ghiscari,were,free,citizens,who,served,for,three-year,terms,<END>
the,line,at,the,well,stretched,back,a,quarter,mile,<END>
there,were,only,a,handful,of,wells,within,a,day's,march,of,meereen,so,the,wait,was,always,long,<END>
most,of,the,yunkish,host,drew,their,drinking,water,from,the,skahazadhan,which,tyrion,had,known,was,a,very,bad,idea,even,before,the,healer's,warning,<END>
the,clever,ones,took,care,to,stay,upstream,of,the,latrines,but,they,were,still,downstream,of,the,city,<END>
the,fact,that,there,were,any,good,wells,at,all,within,a,day's,march,of,the,city,only,went,to,prove,that,daenerys,targaryen,was,still,an,innocent,where,siegecraft,was,concerned,<END>
she,should,have,poisoned,every,well,<END>
then,all,the,yunkishmen,would,be,drinking,from,the,river,<END>

kinslaying,was,not,enough,i,needed,cunt,and,wine,to,seal,my,ruin,and,here,i,am,on,the,wrong,side,of,the,world,wearing,a,slave,collar,with,little,golden,bells,to,announce,my,coming,<END>
if,i,dance,just,right,maybe,i,can,ring,the,rains,of,castamere,<END>
there,was,no,better,place,to,hear,the,latest,news,and,rumors,than,around,the,well,<END>
i,know,what,i,saw,an,old,slave,in,a,rusted,iron,collar,was,saying,as,tyrion,and,penny,shuffled,along,in,the,queue,and,i,saw,that,dragon,ripping,off,arms,and,legs,tearing,men,in,half,burning,them,down,to,ash,and,bones,<END>
people,started,running,trying,to,get,out,of,that,pit,but,i,come,to,see,a,show,and,by,all,the,gods,of,ghis,i,saw,one,<END>
i,was,up,in,the,purple,so,i,didn't,think,the,dragon,was,like,to,trouble,me,<END>
the,queen,climbed,onto,the,dragon's,back,and,flew,away,insisted,a,tall,brown,woman,<END>
she,tried,said,the,old,man,but,she,couldn't,hold,on,<END>
the,crossbows,wounded,the,dragon,and,the,queen,was,struck,right,between,her,sweet,pink,teats,i,hear,<END>
that,was,when,she,fell,<END>
she,died,in,the,gutter,crushed,beneath,a,wagon's,wheels,<END>
i,know,a,girl,who,knows,a,man,who,saw,her,die,<END>
in,this,company,silence,was,the,better,part,of,wisdom,but,tyrion,could,not,help,himself,<END>
no,corpse,was,found,he,said,<END>
the,old,man,frowned,<END>
what,would,you,know,about,it,<END>
they,were,there,said,the,brown,woman,<END>
it's,them,the,jousting,dwarfs,the,ones,who,tilted,for,the,queen,<END>
the,old,man,squinted,down,as,if,seeing,him,and,penny,for,the,first,time,<END>
you're,the,ones,who,rode,the,pigs,<END>
our,notoriety,precedes,us,<END>
tyrion,sketched,a,courtly,bow,and,refrained,from,pointing,out,that,one,of,the,pigs,was,really,a,dog,<END>
the,sow,i,ride,is,actually,my,sister,<END>
we,have,the,same,nose,could,you,tell,<END>

the,pity,is,once,you,get,to,know,her,you'll,want,to,kiss,her,again,to,turn,her,back,<END>
laughter,erupted,all,around,them,<END>
even,the,old,man,joined,in,<END>
you,saw,her,then,said,the,redheaded,boy,behind,them,<END>
you,saw,the,queen,<END>
is,she,as,beautiful,as,they,say,<END>
i,saw,a,slender,girl,with,silvery,hair,wrapped,in,a,tokar,he,might,have,told,them,<END>
her,face,was,veiled,and,i,never,got,close,enough,for,a,good,look,<END>
i,was,riding,on,a,pig,<END>
daenerys,targaryen,had,been,seated,in,the,owner's,box,beside,her,ghiscari,king,but,tyrion's,eyes,had,been,drawn,to,the,knight,in,the,white-and-gold,armor,behind,her,<END>
though,his,features,were,concealed,the,dwarf,would,have,known,barristan,selmy,anywhere,<END>
illyrio,was,right,about,that,much,at,least,he,remembered,thinking,<END>
will,selmy,know,me,though,<END>
and,what,will,he,do,if,he,does,<END>
he,had,almost,revealed,himself,then,and,there,but,something,stopped,him,caution,cowardice,instinct,call,it,what,you,will,<END>
he,could,not,imagine,barristan,the,bold,greeting,him,with,anything,but,hostility,<END>
selmy,had,never,approved,of,jaime's,presence,in,his,precious,kingsguard,<END>
before,the,rebellion,the,old,knight,thought,him,too,young,and,untried,afterward,he,had,been,known,to,say,that,the,kingslayer,should,exchange,that,white,cloak,for,a,black,one,<END>
and,his,own,crimes,were,worse,<END>
jaime,had,killed,a,madman,<END>
tyrion,had,put,a,quarrel,through,the,groin,of,his,own,sire,a,man,ser,barristan,had,known,and,served,for,years,<END>
he,might,have,chanced,it,all,the,same,but,then,penny,had,landed,a,blow,on,his,shield,and,the,moment,was,gone,never,to,return,<END>
the,queen,watched,us,tilt,penny,was,telling,the,other,slaves,in,line,but,that,was,the,only,time,we,saw,her,<END>
you,must,have,seen,the,dragon,said,the,old,man,<END>
would,that,we,had,<END>
the,gods,had,not,even,vouchsafed,him,that,much,<END>
as,daenerys,targaryen,was,taking,wing,nurse,had,been,clapping,irons,round,their,ankles,to,make,certain,they,would,not,attempt,escape,on,their,way,back,to,their,master,<END>
if,the,overseer,had,only,taken,his,leave,after,delivering,them,to,the,abbatoir,or,fled,with,the,rest,of,the,slavers,when,the,dragon,descended,from,the,sky,the,two,dwarfs,might,have,strolled,away,free,<END>
or,run,away,more,like,our,little,bells,a-jingle,<END>
was,there,a,dragon,<END>
tyrion,said,with,a,shrug,<END>
all,i,know,is,that,no,dead,queens,were,found,<END>
the,old,man,was,not,convinced,<END>
ah,they,found,corpses,by,the,hundred,<END>
they,dragged,them,inside,the,pit,and,burned,them,though,half,was,crisp,already,<END>
might,be,they,didn't,know,her,burned,and,bloody,and,crushed,<END>
might,be,they,did,but,decided,to,say,elsewise,to,keep,you,slaves,quiet,<END>
us,slaves,<END>
said,the,brown,woman,<END>
you,wear,a,collar,too,<END>
ghazdor's,collar,the,old,man,boasted,<END>
known,him,since,we,was,born,<END>
i'm,almost,like,a,brother,to,him,<END>
slaves,like,you,sweepings,out,of,astapor,and,yunkai,you,whine,about,being,free,but,i,wouldn't,give,the,dragon,queen,my,collar,if,she,offered,to,suck,my,cock,for,it,<END>
man,has,the,right,master,that's,better,<END>
tyrion,did,not,dispute,him,<END>
the,most,insidious,thing,about,bondage,was,how,easy,it,was,to,grow,accustomed,to,it,<END>
the,life,of,most,slaves,was,not,all,that,different,from,the,life,of,a,serving,man,at,casterly,rock,it,seemed,to,him,<END>
true,some,slaveowners,and,their,overseers,were,brutal,and,cruel,but,the,same,was,true,of,some,westerosi,lords,and,their,stewards,and,bailiffs,<END>
most,of,the,yunkai'i,treated,their,chattels,decently,enough,so,long,as,they,did,their,jobs,and,caused,no,trouble,and,this,old,man,in,his,rusted,collar,with,his,fierce,loyalty,to,lord,wobblecheeks,his,owner,was,not,at,all,atypical,<END>
ghazdor,the,great-hearted,<END>
tyrion,said,sweetly,<END>
our,master,yezzan,has,often,spoken,of,his,wits,<END>
what,yezzan,had,actually,said,was,on,the,order,of,i,have,more,wits,in,the,left,cheek,of,my,arse,than,ghazdor,and,his,brothers,have,between,them,<END>
he,thought,it,prudent,to,omit,the,actual,words,<END>
midday,had,come,and,gone,before,he,and,penny,reached,the,well,where,a,scrawny,one-legged,slave,was,drawing,water,<END>
he,squinted,at,them,suspiciously,<END>
nurse,always,comes,for,yezzan's,water,with,four,men,and,a,mule,cart,<END>
he,dropped,the,bucket,down,the,well,once,more,<END>
there,was,a,soft,splash,<END>
the,one-legged,man,let,the,bucket,fill,then,began,to,draw,it,upward,<END>
his,arms,were,sunburnt,and,peeling,scrawny,to,look,at,but,all,muscle,<END>
the,mule,died,said,tyrion,<END>
so,did,nurse,poor,man,<END>
and,now,yezzan,himself,has,mounted,the,pale,mare,and,six,of,his,soldiers,have,the,shits,<END>
may,i,have,two,pails,full,<END>
as,you,like,<END>
that,was,the,end,of,idle,talk,<END>
is,that,hoofbeats,you,hear,<END>
the,lie,about,the,soldiers,got,old,one-leg,moving,much,more,quickly,<END>
they,started,back,each,of,the,dwarfs,carrying,two,brim-full,pails,of,sweet,water,and,ser,jorah,with,two,pails,in,each,hand,<END>
the,day,was,growing,hotter,the,air,as,thick,and,wet,as,damp,wool,and,the,pails,seemed,to,grow,heavier,with,every,step,<END>
a,long,walk,on,short,legs,<END>
water,sloshed,from,his,pails,with,every,stride,splashing,round,his,legs,whilst,his,bells,played,a,marching,song,<END>
had,i,known,it,would,come,to,this,father,i,might,have,let,you,live,<END>
half,a,mile,east,a,dark,plume,of,smoke,was,rising,where,a,tent,had,been,set,afire,<END>
burning,last,night's,dead,<END>
this,way,tyrion,said,jerking,his,head,to,the,right,<END>
penny,gave,him,a,puzzled,look,<END>
that's,not,how,we,came,<END>
we,don't,want,to,breathe,that,smoke,<END>
it's,full,of,malign,humors,<END>
it,was,not,a,lie,<END>
not,entirely,<END>
penny,was,soon,puffing,struggling,with,the,weight,of,her,pails,<END>
i,need,to,rest,<END>
as,you,wish,<END>
tyrion,set,the,pails,of,water,on,the,ground,grateful,for,the,halt,<END>
his,legs,were,cramping,badly,so,he,found,himself,a,likely,rock,and,sat,on,it,to,rub,his,thighs,<END>
i,could,do,that,for,you,offered,penny,<END>
i,know,where,the,knots,are,<END>
as,fond,as,he,had,grown,of,the,girl,it,still,made,him,uncomfortable,when,she,touched,him,<END>
he,turned,to,ser,jorah,<END>
a,few,more,beatings,and,you'll,be,uglier,than,i,am,mormont,<END>
tell,me,is,there,any,fight,left,in,you,<END>
the,big,knight,raised,two,blackened,eyes,and,looked,at,him,as,he,might,look,at,a,bug,<END>
enough,to,crack,your,neck,imp,<END>
good,<END>
tyrion,picked,up,his,pails,<END>
this,way,then,<END>
penny,wrinkled,her,brow,<END>
no,<END>
it's,to,the,left,<END>
she,pointed,<END>
that's,the,harridan,there,<END>
and,that's,the,wicked,sister,<END>
tyrion,nodded,in,the,other,direction,<END>
trust,me,he,said,<END>
my,way,is,quicker,<END>
he,set,off,his,bells,jingling,<END>
penny,would,follow,he,knew,<END>
sometimes,he,envied,the,girl,all,her,pretty,little,dreams,<END>
she,reminded,him,of,sansa,stark,the,child,bride,he,had,wed,and,lost,<END>
despite,the,horrors,penny,had,suffered,she,remained,somehow,trusting,<END>
she,should,know,better,<END>
she,is,older,than,sansa,<END>
and,she's,a,dwarf,<END>
she,acts,as,if,she,has,forgotten,that,as,if,she,were,highborn,and,fair,to,look,upon,instead,of,a,slave,in,a,grotesquerie,<END>
at,night,tyrion,would,oft,hear,her,praying,<END>
a,waste,of,words,<END>
if,there,are,gods,to,listen,they,are,monstrous,gods,who,torment,us,for,their,sport,<END>
who,else,would,make,a,world,like,this,so,full,of,bondage,blood,and,pain,<END>
who,else,would,shape,us,as,they,have,<END>
sometimes,he,wanted,to,slap,her,shake,her,scream,at,her,anything,to,wake,her,from,her,dreams,<END>
no,one,is,going,to,save,us,he,wanted,to,scream,at,her,<END>
the,worst,is,yet,to,come,<END>
yet,somehow,he,could,never,say,the,words,<END>
instead,of,giving,her,a,good,hard,crack,across,that,ugly,face,of,hers,to,knock,the,blinders,from,her,eyes,he,would,find,himself,squeezing,her,shoulder,or,giving,her,a,hug,<END>
every,touch,a,lie,<END>
i,have,paid,her,so,much,false,coin,that,she,half,thinks,she's,rich,<END>
he,had,even,kept,the,truth,of,daznak's,pit,from,her,<END>
lions,<END>
they,were,going,to,set,lions,on,us,<END>
it,would,have,been,exquisitely,ironic,that,<END>
perhaps,he,would,have,had,time,for,a,short,bitter,chortle,before,being,torn,apart,<END>
no,one,ever,told,him,the,end,that,had,been,planned,for,them,not,in,so,many,words,but,it,had,not,been,hard,to,puzzle,out,down,beneath,the,bricks,of,daznak's,pit,in,the,hidden,world,below,the,seats,the,dark,domain,of,the,pit,fighters,and,the,serving,men,who,tended,to,them,quick,and,dead,the,cooks,who,fed,them,the,ironmongers,who,armed,them,the,barber-surgeons,who,bled,them,and,shaved,them,and,bound,up,their,wounds,the,whores,who,serviced,them,before,and,after,fights,the,corpse,handlers,who,dragged,the,losers,off,the,sands,with,chains,and,iron,hooks,<END>
nurse's,face,had,given,tyrion,his,first,inkling,<END>
after,their,show,he,and,penny,had,returned,to,the,torchlit,vault,where,the,fighters,gathered,before,and,after,their,matches,<END>
some,sat,sharpening,their,weapons,others,sacrificed,to,queer,gods,or,dulled,their,nerves,with,milk,of,the,poppy,before,going,out,to,die,<END>
those,who'd,fought,and,won,were,dicing,in,a,corner,laughing,as,only,men,who,have,just,faced,death,and,lived,can,laugh,<END>
nurse,was,paying,out,some,silver,to,a,pit,man,on,a,lost,wager,when,he,spied,penny,leading,crunch,<END>
the,confusion,in,his,eyes,was,gone,in,half,a,heartbeat,but,not,before,tyrion,grasped,what,it,meant,<END>
nurse,did,not,expect,us,back,<END>
he,had,looked,around,at,other,faces,<END>
none,of,them,expected,us,back,<END>
we,were,meant,to,die,out,there,<END>
the,final,piece,fell,into,place,when,he,overheard,an,animal,trainer,complaining,loudly,to,the,pitmaster,<END>
the,lions,are,hungry,<END>
two,days,since,they,ate,<END>
i,was,told,not,to,feed,them,and,i,haven't,<END>
the,queen,should,pay,for,meat,<END>
you,take,that,up,with,her,the,next,time,she,holds,court,the,pitmaster,threw,back,at,him,<END>
even,now,penny,did,not,suspect,<END>
when,she,spoke,about,the,pit,her,chief,worry,was,that,more,people,had,not,laughed,<END>
they,would,have,pissed,themselves,laughing,if,the,lions,had,been,loosed,tyrion,almost,told,her,<END>
instead,he'd,squeezed,her,shoulder,<END>
penny,came,to,a,sudden,halt,<END>
we're,going,the,wrong,way,<END>
we're,not,<END>
tyrion,lowered,his,pails,to,the,ground,<END>
the,handles,had,gouged,deep,grooves,in,his,fingers,<END>
those,are,the,tents,we,want,there,<END>
the,second,sons,<END>
a,queer,smile,split,ser,jorah's,face,<END>
if,you,think,to,find,help,there,you,don't,know,brown,ben,plumm,<END>
oh,i,do,<END>
plumm,and,i,have,played,five,games,of,cyvasse,<END>
brown,ben,is,shrewd,tenacious,not,unintelligent,but,wary,<END>
he,likes,to,let,his,opponent,take,the,risks,whilst,he,sits,back,and,keeps,his,options,open,reacting,to,the,battle,as,it,takes,shape,<END>
battle,<END>
what,battle,<END>
penny,backed,away,from,him,<END>
we,have,to,get,back,<END>
the,master,needs,clean,water,<END>
if,we,take,too,long,we'll,be,whipped,<END>
and,pretty,pig,and,crunch,are,there,<END>
sweets,will,see,that,they,are,taken,care,of,tyrion,lied,<END>
more,like,scar,and,his,friends,would,soon,be,feasting,on,ham,and,bacon,and,a,savory,dog,stew,but,penny,did,not,need,to,hear,that,<END>
nurse,is,dead,and,yezzan's,dying,<END>
it,could,be,dark,before,anyone,thinks,to,miss,us,<END>
we,will,never,have,a,better,chance,than,now,<END>

you,know,what,they,do,when,they,catch,slaves,trying,to,escape,<END>
you,know,<END>
please,<END>
they'll,never,let,us,leave,the,camp,<END>
we,haven't,left,the,camp,<END>
tyrion,picked,up,his,pails,<END>
he,set,off,at,a,brisk,waddle,never,looking,back,<END>
mormont,fell,in,beside,him,<END>
after,a,moment,he,heard,the,sounds,of,penny,hurrying,after,him,down,a,sandy,slope,to,a,circle,of,ragged,tents,<END>
the,first,guard,appeared,as,they,neared,the,horse,lines,a,lean,spearman,whose,maroon,beard,marked,him,as,tyroshi,<END>
what,do,we,have,here,<END>
and,what,have,you,got,in,those,pails,<END>

you,lost,dwarf,<END>
the,guard,demanded,<END>
we're,here,to,join,your,company,<END>
a,pail,slipped,from,penny's,grasp,and,overturned,<END>
half,the,water,had,spilled,before,she,could,right,it,once,again,<END>
we,got,fools,enough,in,this,company,<END>
why,would,we,want,three,more,<END>
the,tyroshi,flicked,at,tyrion's,collar,with,his,spearpoint,ringing,the,little,golden,bell,<END>
a,runaway,slave,is,what,i,see,<END>
three,runaway,slaves,<END>

all,three,<END>
the,tyroshi,gestured,with,his,spear,<END>
tyrion,moved,along,<END>
the,other,sellsword,a,stripling,hardly,more,than,a,boy,with,fuzz,on,his,cheeks,and,hair,the,color,of,dirty,straw,scooped,up,penny,under,one,arm,<END>

the,stripling,slung,penny,over,one,shoulder,<END>
tyrion,went,ahead,as,quick,as,his,stunted,legs,would,allow,<END>

a,few,sellswords,turned,to,watch,them,pass,and,a,camp,follower,sniggered,but,no,one,moved,to,interfere,<END>
within,the,tent,they,found,camp,stools,and,a,trestle,table,a,rack,of,spears,and,halberds,a,floor,covered,with,threadbare,carpets,in,half,a,dozen,clashing,colors,and,three,officers,<END>
